The Vance family will be staying at the ITC Maurya Sheraton hotel in Delhi.

Later on Monday night, the Vances will travel to Jaipur, where they will stay at the luxurious Rambagh Palace, a former royal residence.

On April 22, they will visit famous sites in Jaipur, including Amer Fort (also known as Amber Fort), a Unesco World Heritage Site.

In the afternoon, Vice President Vance will speak at the Rajasthan International Centre, where he is expected to talk about India-US relations under the Trump administration. Diplomats, Indian officials, academics, and policy experts are likely to attend.

The next day, April 23, the Vance family will travel to Agra to visit the iconic Taj Mahal and Shilpgram, an open-air market showcasing Indian art and crafts. They will return to Jaipur later that evening.

The Vances are scheduled to fly back to the US from Jaipur on April 24.

This came after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi urged the Karnataka government to introduce the Act, citing the need to eliminate caste discrimination in education.In his letter, Siddaramaiah responded to Gandhi’s April 16 message that referenced an incident faced by Dr BR Ambedkar. ""The reference in your letter dated 16th April 2025, to the incident faced by Dr B R Ambedkar, as narrated by him is indeed a sad reality even to this day.

""It is a shame that even today millions of students from Dalit, Adivasi and OBC communities have to face such brutal discrimination in our educational system,"" Gandhi wrote.He also invoked the tragic deaths of students like Rohith Vemula, Payal Tadvi, and Darshan Solanki as examples of institutional discrimination. ""The murder of bright young people like Rohith Vemula, Payal Tadvi and Darshan Solanki is simply not acceptable. It is time to put a firm end to this. I urge the Karnataka government to enact the Rohith Vemula Act so that no child of India has to face what Dr B R Ambedkar, Rohit Vemula and millions of others have had to endure,"" he said.Rohith Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad, died by suicide in 2016, a case that sparked national outrage and became a symbol of caste-based discrimination in academia.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

'Hero' neighbours among 1st responders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hero-neighbours-among-1st-responders/articleshow/120446701.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the dust settled and the cries for help grew louder, a remarkable tale of humanity unfolded. Neighbours and rescuers scrambling among the rubble turned heroes digging out people to safety.Taslim and Salman were among the first to respond to the collapse of the building on Street No. 1 in Shakti Vihar , Mustafabad. They rushed to the disaster site to see how they could help. They had no rescue equipment but plenty of determination and worked tirelessly, ultimately saving at least six lives.Taslim recalled the harrowing scene, ""For 15-20 minutes, there was only white dust, from which one could hear cries for help. We began lifting the broken cement blocks, working alongside others to rescue trapped people."" The six people they pulled out were sent to hospitals.Soon the professional rescue teams arrived on the scene, but that early intervention by the do-gooders proved crucial. The rescuers faced challenges in operating in the congested area, especially since the building had collapsed like a pancake, limiting the use of their equipment. According to Mohsen Shahedi, DIG (Operations), NDRF, such a collapse significantly reduces survival chances due to floors collapsing onto each other leaving little possibility of voids.Rescue teams typically use specialised equipment like wall detectors to locate trapped survivors. However, on this occasion, a rescue official explained, ""We couldn't use wall detectors due to significant disturbances since they rely on thermal waves. The movement of people was also a hindrance. Instead, we had to rely on cutters and drill machines.""According to NDRF officials, the narrow lane forced them to park their vehicles far from the spot, making it difficult to bring in dumpers to move debris and aid in the search. Fire tenders were parked at a distance and only one JCB excavator could be deployed. A canine squad was called to the spot to assist in the search and help the personnel pinpoint spots where the victims could be lying trapped.Two neighbouring buildings were also damaged and its residents had to be evacuated. ""If those buildings hadn't been affected, we would have had more space for rescue work,"" a fire officer said.According to rescuers, an empty space nearby was useful for throwing the debris. ""Because of space constraints, we had no other option but to stand on the rubble and work, which is not desirable because victims might be lying below at that spot. Even while using the drilling machine, we had to be very careful,"" said a rescuer.","Neighbours and rescuers scrambling among the rubble turned heroes digging out people to safety.

E-notices will be issued for non-compliance and continued failure to pay may lead to FASTag suspension along with other VAHAN-related penalties, the statement warned.The ministry reiterated that this tech-driven upgrade is being piloted only at select toll plazas for now and is not a blanket nationwide rollout.","The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) dismissed reports suggesting that a satellite-based tolling system would be rolled out nationwide from 1 May 2025.

Additionally, only those who appeared in both or either session of JEE Main 2025 and meet age, attempt, and academic requirements as specified by the IITs are allowed to apply.Over the past four years, the cutoff trend for JEE (Advanced) eligibility based on JEE Main scores has shown a steady upward trajectory across all categories, reflecting growing competition and improved academic performance among aspirants. This consistent rise suggests increased access to coaching resources, broader outreach of STEM education, and possibly more aspirants opting for multiple attempts to maximise their scores. It also signals that even reserved category candidates are performing at higher levels, narrowing historic gaps in achievement.","The Joint Entrance Examination Main 2025 was conducted in two phases with the best score being considered for those who attempted both. Nearly 15.4 lakh unique candidates registered, and almost 14.8 lakh appeared across the sessions. The April session alone saw over 10.6 lakh registrations, with 9.9 lakh candidates appearing for the test.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120445647,imgsize-26470,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
India 1st nation to achieve artificial breeding of Great Indian Bustard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-1st-nation-to-achieve-artificial-breeding-of-great-indian-bustard/articleshow/120445296.cms,"JAISALMER : India became the world’s first country to achieve success in the artificial breeding of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) with the birth of the third GIB chick through artificial insemination at Jaisalmer’s Desert National Park Thursday.The technology and training for artificial insemination, obtained from Abu Dhabi-based organisation “International Fund for Houbara Conservation”, contributed to saving this rapidly vanishing Schedule I wildlife species. Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientists had received specialised training from the organisation.Suthirto Dutta, WII senior scientist and coordinator of the GIB project at the Jaisalmer Bustard Breeding Centre, said this was the third chick born entirely through artificial methods under this project, marking a historic achievement for India. This groundbreaking development was not just a success of a biological experiment but a milestone in giving new life to this rare bird on the brink of extinction. Dutta said the Bustard Recovery Programme achieved this remarkable feat through artificial insemination. The scientific team procured semen from a male at the Sam Conservation Breeding Centre and artificially inseminated a four-year-old female at the facility.“Project Great Indian Bustard reached a new milestone as the 11th chick of 2025 hatched on April 17 from an egg laid by the female ‘Sharky’ on March 26 in Sam Centre, after being artificially inseminated on March 20 with semen from the male ‘Suda’ housed in Ramdevra Centre, taking the GIB tally in the national conservation breeding programme to 55. This also marked the third success in artificial insemination for the species,” said Dutta.Suthirto Dutta said the procedure involved collecting male bustard sperm for artificial insemination, culminating in the birth of a vigorous chick. WII’s endeavours proved fruitful, with the artificial breeding centre demonstrating its efficacy. Specialists verified the chick’s robust health condition.","India becomes the world’s first country to achieve success in the artificial breeding of the Great Indian Bustard.

MUMBAI: Heart tumours are rare, with an incidence of less than one case per one million population. Dombivli resident Yogesh Mehta , 67, not only had a myxoma or benign heart tumour , but also had a blockage in one of the heart's main arteries.""It is rare to find a right atrial myxoma and even more rare to have a concomitant coronary artery disease in the same patient,"" said cardiac surgeon Dr Bijoy Kutty, who performed an emergency surgery on Mehta to fix the twin problems.Mehta, who used to manage a hardware business, had peculiar symptoms that never seemed like a ""heart-related problem"" to him. He experienced loose motions and weakness, prompting doctors to check his digestive system.Even the most telling symptom - he would get breathless or pass out as soon as he lay down on the bed - was not interpreted as a heart problem. ""These unique symptoms were missed by multiple doctors he consulted in the last two months,"" said Dr Kutty. In hindsight, the tumour grew to such an extent that it pressed down on his heart and blood vessels, thus affecting blood flow that resulted in dizzy spells. ""When we removed the tumour, it was the size of a small orange,"" said the surgeon.Mehta's wife, Trupti, said he had diabetes and hypertension for many years, but the family had no inkling about a heart problem until March 23 when he fell in the bathroom. ""It took us some time to revive him,"" she said. His son, Paras, rushed him to the nearby Om Hospital, which referred him to the heart-specialty Icon Hospital in Dombivli.Dr Kutty, who checked Mehta at Icon Hospital, found the tumour as well as the blockage in scans. ""However, I requested the family to transfer him to our bigger sister hospital, Platinum Hospital in Mulund,"" said the doctor. On March 26, Mehta underwent cardiac surgery to remove both the tumour and the blockage in his left anterior descending artery. The operation lasted five hours, and doctors said the tumour would not recur. The main concern with heart tumours, whether benign or malignant, is the risk of embolization - say, a piece of the tumour breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, blocking an artery and causing a stroke or other complications.Mehta, who has three sons, is grateful his ""double heart problems"" were sorted out. ""I have got a second life,"" he said.","Dombivli resident Yogesh Mehta, 67, not only had a myxoma or benign heart tumour, but also had a blockage in one of the heart's main arteries.

The modalities have identified issues which are to be taken up and how the technical aspects of the negotiations, such as rules of origin or customs facilitation, would work. But firm offers will be made later.In early March, US President Donald Trump and PM Narendra Modi agreed to launch talks for a bilateral trade deal, but since then, reciprocal tariffs have come into the picture. With Trump offering a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, there may be an opportunity to harvest some of the low-hanging fruits that are mutually beneficial to both sides, sources indicated. Of course, it is contingent upon the American side being willing to engage in talks at a time when countries from across the globe are rushing to DC to see how they can avoid reciprocal tariffs.Some clarity is also expected to emerge during US Vice-President J D Vance's visit to India, starting Monday, when he is scheduled to meet Modi.The team led by India's chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal will be in DC for three-day talks from April 23 to discuss the path forward as technical talks commence. ""Both sides will discuss the level of ambition. The terms of reference will be further developed and discussed"" an official said.Sources said that services, which is a key focus for govt, is likely to be part of the second tranche. Trump has mainly focused on tariffs during his offensive against countries, including India, and wants duties slashed for products of interest to the US.

DGCA orders probe into Air India Express captain Armaan's death at Delhi Airport

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered a thorough investigation into the death of Air India Express First Officer Armaan's death who had collapsed after safely landing a Srinagar-Delhi flight last Wednesday. In his order, DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai has said that the probe team will take into account factors like the deceased pilot's medical history; whether any protocol needs to be devised for crew with such medical conditions and the time taken at Delhi Airport in providing the pilot the required care and the quality of the same.The probe panel comprising of Vishal Yadav, DGCA's deputy director air safety as investigator-in-charge, and Group Captain Murtaza, DMS (CA) subject matter expert as a member, has been asked to submit its report ""preferably"" within six months.Kidwai has asked the team to examine these points, among any other that the investigation throws up: ""Whether the crew reported about sickness to air traffic control (ATC) while in air and if so, whether ATC initiated action appropriately; check the medical history of the deceased crew; whether due precaution was taken during rostering of such crew who has flying restriction due to medical reasons.""""(Whether) any specific medical checks are required for such pilots to undergo before undertaking the flights; whether remaining onboard crew took action when crew reported feeling unwell; time taken in taking him to the medical centre at the airport/civil hospital; check the level of preparedness of the medical centre at the airport in handling such emergencies,' the probe panel has been asked to examine these areas too and also ""examine the existing guidelines / circulars in this regard and suggest changes if needed.""First officer Armaan, 35, had suffered a ""sudden cardiac arrest"" while operating flight IX-1153 from Srinagar to Delhi on April 9, 2025. After safely landing in Delhi, he went to the aircraft lavatory where he vomited. He collapsed in the forward galley and was taken to the airport medical centre by cabin crew and ground staff. He was then taken to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj but could not be saved.Armaan, who went by his first name only, had joined Air India Express in 2023 from SpiceJet. He had flown for less than 12 hours in the last seven days, it is learnt.Following his death, the Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) had said in a statement there’s an urgent need to put in place transparent regulations that prioritise rest for pilots, safety and humane scheduling practices. The association, which represents over 800 pilots of various Indian carriers, has stressed the need for having comprehensive mental health support systems within airline organisations and not merely as checkboxes but as active, accessible, and stigma-free services. ALPA says the untimely death of Captain Armaan’s death raises troubling questions about pilot welfare, mental health, and working conditions in the Indian aviation industry.While not linking Armaan’s tragic death to fatigue, several pilots say they have for a long time been pleading for less strenuous working conditions in India. After a significant delay, slightly less strenuous flight duty time limitations (FDTL) rules, that govern key issues like how much a pilot can fly with what rest periods and limits on night flying, are set to be enforced from this summer.“Many pilots have lost their lives suddenly in last few years, especially post Covid, and we have been fighting for a more humane FDTL. We just hope nothing else delays implementation of the new rules, something which we have seen in the past. Well rested and not stressed pilots are key to safe flights,” said many senior pilots.",DGCA orders probe into Air India Express captain Armaan's death at Delhi Airport.

GST on UPI transactions: Government denies reports of levying GST on UPI transactions over Rs 2000,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/false-misleading-government-denies-reports-of-levying-gst-on-upi-transactions-over-rs-2000/articleshow/120408353.cms,"The government on Friday denied reports suggesting GST levying on UPI transactions exceeding Rs 2,000, calling such claims “completely false, misleading, and without any basis. ”In an official statement, the finance ministry said, “Currently, there is no such proposal before the government,” dismissing concerns that had surfaced earlier.The ministry also clarifyed the tax framework, explaining that GST is only applicable on charges like the merchant discount rate (MDR), which are relevant for certain payment methods.However, in January 2020, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) eliminated MDR on person-to-merchant (P2M) UPI transactions.“Since currently no MDR is charged on UPI transactions, there is consequently no GST applicable to these transactions,” the ministry stated.UPI, or Unified Payments Interface , has witnessed a remarkable surge in usage, with transaction values skyrocketing from Rs 21.3 lakh crore in 2019-20 to a soaring Rs 260.56 lakh crore, that was projected by the end of March 2025.To further encourage this growth, the government has been running an incentive scheme since 2021-22, specifically aimed at low-value P2M UPI transactions.The initiative is designed to support small merchants by absorbing transaction costs and driving broader adoption of digital payments.In the last financial year, 2023-24, Rs 3,631 crore was disbursed under this scheme, a sharp rise from Rs 2,210 crore in 2022-23. In FY 2021-2011, the allocation was Rs 1,389 crore.“The total incentive payouts under this scheme over the years reflect the government's sustained commitment to promoting UPI-based digital payments,” the ministry added.The press release said that India accounted for 49 per cent of worldwide real time transactions in 2023, as per the ACI Worldwide report 2024.","GST is only applicable on charges like the merchant discount rate (MDR), which are relevant for certain payment methods.

Taylor Swift’s new era with Travis Kelce sparks questions about Joe Alwyn’s quiet exit

Taylor Swift has always been intentional about her narrative—every lyric, outfit, and public appearance has meaning. But since going public with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, fans have noticed something subtle yet striking: the virtual disappearance of her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn from her recent storylines. Was this deliberate, or just the natural progression of moving on?Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift were together for six years—her longest relationship to date. Though private, their romance heavily influenced several of her most emotionally resonant albums, including Folklore, Evermore, and parts of Midnights. Songs like “The 1,” “Invisible String,” and “Peace” were widely believed to be about the British actor. Yet since their split and her blossoming romance with Kelce, mentions of Alwyn have grown eerily scarce.Fans began to notice the shift during the international leg of Swift’s Eras Tour. As she introduced tracks from Midnights and updated setlists, her emphasis leaned more toward empowerment, growth, and joy—qualities many associate with her relationship with Kelce. The emotional depth of the Alwyn era seemed to fade into the background, replaced by sparkle, stadium anthems, and viral NFL appearances.Adding fuel to the speculation is Swift’s growing presence in sports culture, amplified by her relationship with Kelce. Her appearance at Chiefs games and Kelce’s cameos at her shows signal not just a relationship, but a cultural merge that’s being embraced by both fanbases. It’s a public evolution—and with it, perhaps, a quiet edit of what came before.While Swift has never directly commented on Alwyn post-breakup, her artistic choices may be doing the talking. Her newly released content and public appearances focus almost exclusively on the now—with Kelce prominently part of that picture.Whether Taylor is rewriting history or simply writing a new chapter, the shift is undeniable. Alwyn’s influence lives in her past work, but he no longer seems to have a place in the story she’s telling today.Also Read: The man behind Taylor Swift's love songs: Why Joe Alwyn’s influence may outlast Travis Kelce As Swift continues to evolve, one thing is clear: her legacy is hers to shape. And with Travis Kelce by her side, she seems more willing than ever to let go of what was and fully embrace what is—and what’s next.","Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift were together for six years.

What Barack-Michelle said about rumors of their divorce



Barack Obama-Michelle marriage crisis is far from finishing its shelf life as people can't stop talking about it. And the main reason for it is that Barack and Michelle can't stop talking about their marriage either. Michelle has addressed her marriage in her new podcast IMO, with her co-host and older brother Craig Robinson.Megyn Kelly , in the latest episode of her podcast, spoke about what Michelle and Barack have been saying about each other and concluded that they married the wrong people. ""I’ve been married for 17-and-a-half years and not one was bad. I think she and he married the wrong people. Every word she says about Barack Obama is negative… Every time she opines, it’s something that reflects poorly on him – how he’s insensitive, how he’s not a talker, how he doesn’t know how to relate to people, he doesn’t keep the same schedule as she does. And now we’re talking about how you can have a bad decade in a marriage,"" Megyn said.Megyn Kelly fails to mention she's been married twice, Mike Sington wrote on X taking a swipe at Megyn.The rumors of an impending divorce of Barack Obama and Michelle were so intense that Barack Obama was even linked with actor Jennifer Aniston, when Michelle Obama missed several public events where a former first lady is expected to accompany her husband.Barack Obama opened up about his relationship with Michelle and recently revealed that he was in a ""deep deficit"" with Michelle after leaving office and he's still trying to make up to her. “I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things,” he said.Michelle Obama commented on Barack's solo appearances and said she now has the opportunity to control her own calendar and can now make “a choice for myself.”“I could have made a lot of these decisions years ago, but I didn’t give myself that freedom,” she said. “And now that’s gone. And so now I have to look at my — I get to look at my calendar, which I did this year, was a real big example of me, myself looking at something that I was supposed to do — you know, without naming names — and I chose to do what was best for me, not what I had to do, not what I thought other people wanted me to do.”“That’s the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people,” Michelle continued. “I mean so much so that this year people were, you know — they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”","Megyn Kelly said she thinks Barack and Michelle Obama married the wrong persons.

Flight reaches Delhi

NEW DELHI: A Delhi-bound IndiGo flight carrying Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah was diverted to Jaipur on Saturday night.This incident prompted a strong reaction from the CM, who described the situation at Delhi airport as “operational chaos”.The flight, which took off from Jammu, remained in the air for nearly three hours before being rerouted to Jaipur due to apparent congestion or disruption at the national capital’s airport. Passengers, including Abdullah, were left stranded past midnight, with no clarity on when the journey would resume.Taking to X, Abdullah wrote: “Delhi airport is a bloody s**t show (excuse my French but I'm in no mood to be polite). 3 hours in the air after we left Jammu we get diverted to Jaipur & so here I am at 1 in the morning on the steps of the plane getting some fresh air. I've no idea what time we will leave from here.”He also posted a selfie, standing on the aircraft’s steps, after stepping out briefly.The disruption comes amid a broader wave of travel troubles in the Jammu region. Earlier in the day, chaotic scenes were reported at Jammu airport, where hundreds of passengers faced delays and cancellations. Flight operations in and out of Srinagar were also thrown off schedule due to bad weather, which had a ripple effect on connecting flights, including the one carrying Abdullah.On Friday evening, IndiGo had already flagged potential issues due to weather in a travel advisory shared on social media: “#6ETravelAdvisory: Unfavourable weather in #Srinagar is impacting flights, but we're here to keep you informed!” the post read, along with links for passengers to check flight status and explore flexible travel options.In a follow-up advisory, the airline added: “Weather conditions in Srinagar are impacting flight operations. We understand this may cause inconvenience and truly appreciate your patience… Our teams are actively monitoring the situation and will have smooth operations back on track as soon as the weather plays nice.”After the brief delay, the Indigo flight carrying J&K CM Omar Abdullah took off from Jaipur at 2.00 am and landed in Delhi."," Indigo flight carrying J&K CM Omar Abdullah was diverted to Jaipur.

Georgia district court provides interim relief: Blocks termination of legal status of 133 international students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/georgia-district-court-provides-interim-relief-blocks-termination-of-legal-status-of-133-international-students/articleshow/120439608.cms,"In a significant ruling, the US district court (Northern District of Georgia) has granted temporary relief to 133 international students who faced sudden termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. With their legal status terminated, had it not been for the district court’s intervention, the students would have had to deport.The district court on Friday evening, issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), ordering the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reinstate the plaintiffs’ SEVIS records retroactive to March 31, 2025. It also barred federal authorities from using or disclosing the students' personal information outside the scope of this litigation. By Tuesday, US government agencies (defendants to this case) have been ordered to file a notice of compliance with this order.The students, all F-1 visa holders , had filed an urgent plea alleging unlawful actions by federal immigration authorities. This lawsuit is among the largest of its kind concerning SEVIS terminations. All of them were actively enrolled in colleges and universities throughout the US – many of them were weeks away from graduation, or were lawfully undergoing Optional Practical Training (OPT). International students can gain work experience under the OPT program for a year on completion of their studies, this period is further extended by two years for those from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) streams.Charles Kuck, founding partner of Kuck Baxter, an immigration law firm, who represented the students told TOI, “The overt ignoring of set immigration laws and policies by the Trump administration as it relates to foreign students is not just stunning, but dangerous. It sends a message that will reverberate for a generation as the best and most talented students that might have come to the US will consider and pursue their education options in other countries. This bad for America.” All 133 international students proceeded with the lawsuit pseudonymously and had sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against officials from the (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the US Attorney General. This was prompted by notices received between April 1 and April 14, informing them that their SEVIS records had been terminated—citing either criminal background checks, visa revocations, or alleged failure to maintain lawful status.This lawsuit is among the largest of its kind concerning SEVIS terminations The students argued that the terminations were baseless and procedurally improper. They emphasized that they had no criminal records and had complied with all legal requirements of their student visas.In their complaint, the students alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. They argued that the termination actions lacked proper notice, were devoid of an articulated legal basis, and were executed without giving them an opportunity to respond. The terminations, they claimed, were arbitrary, capricious, and beyond the legal authority granted to immigration agencies.They contended that once admitted to the US with an F-1 visa, international students are granted permission to stay for the ‘duration of status’ as long as they meet the requirements of this visa - maintaining a full course of study and avoiding unauthorised employment.In some, but not all of these cases, the US Department of State (DOS) has revoked the student’s visa. But, the revocation of a F-1 visa does not necessarily impact the person’s lawful presence in the country. As such, plaintiffs contended that it is the SEVIS registration termination that has rendered them vulnerable to devastating immigration outcomes such as detention and deportation, as well as irreparable harm.The district court concurred with the plaintiffs, finding they had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their case. Specifically, the district court held that DHS’s power to terminate F-1 status is tightly constrained by regulation and did not apply in this situation.Judge Victoria Marie Calvert observed that visa revocation alone does not equate to a loss of legal immigration status and cannot be used to justify SEVIS termination . In particular she added, “There is substantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.”According to immigration attorneys, this line captures the core of the district court's reasoning—it’s not just about protecting the students, but also about ensuring that government agencies act within the law. It underscores the principle that adherence to legal procedures is fundamental, even in matters involving immigration and national security.Judge Calvert also acknowledged the irreparable harm the students faced: loss of educational opportunities, expulsion from the US on short notice, forfeiture of scholarships and jobs, and severe emotional distress. She cited similar rulings from other district courts that had intervened in SEVIS-related terminations, affirming the need for judicial oversight.The court dismissed the argument that the students could have sought relief under the Privacy Act, noting that the act does not cover international students but applies to permanent residents (green card holders) and US citizens.","133 international students faced sudden termination of their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

NEW DELHI: Anaya Bangar , daughter of former India cricketer and coach Sanjay Bangar , has spoken out about the toxic masculinity that continues to plague the cricketing world. In a candid interview, Anaya revealed disturbing experiences she has faced within the cricketing circle, including receiving nude photos from cricketers, verbal abuse, and being propositioned by a former player.Anaya, who publicly came out last year and shared her journey of transformation through hormone replacement therapy and gender-affirming surgery , was formerly known as Aryan. She followed in her father’s footsteps, playing age-group cricket in India. However, she said the journey after transitioning came with many challenges.“There has been support and there have been some harassment as well,” Anaya said during an interview with Lallantop, reflecting on her journey.When asked how fellow cricketers responded after her gender-affirming surgery, Anaya said: “There have been a few cricketers who randomly sent me nude pictures of them.”She also shared more distressing experiences:“The person used to give gaalis in front of everybody. The same person then used to come and sit beside me and ask for my photos. There was another instance, when I was in India, I told a puraane (veteran) cricketer about my situation. He told me let’s go in the car, I want to sleep with you.”Having played alongside prominent Indian cricketers like Musheer Khan, Sarfaraz Khan, and Yashasvi Jaiswal during her early years, Anaya said she was forced to keep her identity hidden because of her father’s public profile.“I had to maintain secrecy about myself because dad is a well known figure. Cricket world is filled with insecurity and toxic masculinity,” she added.Anaya has represented Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai’s club circuit and also played for Hinckley Cricket Club in Leicestershire, UK.However, her cricketing ambitions faced a major setback in November 2023, when the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced a new policy barring transgender women from participating in international women’s cricket.“Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women’s game and the safety of players,” then-ICC CEO Geoff Allardice had said.Anaya responded to the policy with a detailed post on Instagram, expressing her disappointment with the decision.She currently resides in the United Kingdom.",Anaya Bangar is the daughter of former India cricketer and coach Sanjay Bangar.

Google, Meta, Microsoft among top tech firms slashing jobs in 2025

Google: Streamlining amid structural shifts

Microsoft: Organizational restructuring expected in May

Meta: Performance-based layoffs and executive bonus backlash

TikTok: Job reductions in Dublin office

The technology sector is undergoing yet another wave of workforce reductions in 2025, following an already turbulent 2024 marked by widespread layoffs. As companies shift their focus to automation, artificial intelligence, and cost-efficiency, job cuts are becoming a recurring theme across some of the industry's biggest players. According to data from layoff tracking platform Trueup, 234 layoffs have already been recorded in the tech industry this year, affecting 45,656 employees—an average of 439 job losses per day.For comparison, 2024 saw a total of 1,115 layoff incidents with a staggering 238,461 workers affected, translating to an average of 653 daily dismissals. The job cuts reflect a strategic realignment aimed at optimizing resource allocation and enhancing profitability, particularly in high-growth segments such as AI and cloud computing.Google has been among the most active in workforce restructuring, entering its third round of layoffs in 2025. This latest reduction targets several hundred employees within its Platforms & Devices unit, which encompasses key products including Android, Pixel smartphones, and the Chrome web browser.Earlier in the year, Google initiated a “voluntary exit” program specifically for U.S.-based employees in the same division. This followed a 2024 internal reorganization that merged Android and Pixel teams to consolidate operations. The company also reduced headcount in its cloud division in February 2025. A Google spokesperson stated that the actions were necessary “to continue to invest in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.”Microsoft is reportedly preparing for another round of layoffs expected to take place as early as May 2025. While official numbers have not been disclosed, internal restructuring is likely to target middle management layers. The company's ongoing objective is to increase the ratio of technical personnel, especially engineers, across all business units.Within Microsoft’s security division, for instance, leadership aims to shift the engineer-to-project manager ratio from 5.5:1 to a leaner 10:1. Performance evaluations are playing a significant role in the decision-making process, and employees with consistently low performance ratings may face termination as part of the streamlining efforts.In February 2025, Meta laid off approximately 3,600 employees, representing nearly 5% of its global workforce. The layoffs were primarily attributed to internal performance evaluations and are consistent with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stated vision of transforming Meta into a more efficient and agile organization.However, the timing of the layoffs attracted criticism after the company announced sizable bonus allocations for senior executives shortly afterward. This has sparked debate about compensation disparities and employee morale, especially as many mid- and entry-level workers were affected by the cuts.TikTok has joined the list of tech companies implementing layoffs this year, with around 300 jobs expected to be eliminated at its Dublin office. While the final number is yet to be confirmed, the redundancies are anticipated to take place in April 2025.This move follows a broader trend of workforce optimization across the technology sector, raising concerns among employees in Europe and beyond about job security. The reduction also underscores the challenges facing social media companies amid shifting regulatory environments and growing operational costs.","Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other tech giants cut jobs amid restructuring in 2025.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday explained the reason behind its decision to withdraw the transhipment facility for Bangladeshi exports and said that it was a response to Dhaka's actions affecting bilateral trade.The decision seems to came after Bangladesh's interim government stopped Indian yarn imports and closed three land ports.""We stand for a democratic, for an inclusive, and for a prosperous Bangladesh. As far as trade issues are concerned, last week we had made an announcement regarding trans-shipment facility,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during weekly media briefing when asked about India-Bangladesh trade relations.""We had taken that measure because of the congestion that we see on our Ports and our Airports. But I would also remind you, please do have a look at the developments that have happened on the Bangladeshi side prior to us announcing these measures,"" he added.India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy. The customs circular, issued Tuesday, said cargo that had already entered India would be allowed to be shipped out. Confirming the development that comes amid the strife in India-Bangladesh ties, MEA said the transshipment used to cause congestion at Indian airports and ports, but added the order won't hit Dhaka's exports to Nepal and Bhutan passing through India.The transhipment arrangement, established in 2020 to enhance trade relations, has been affected by recent developments.Jaiswal mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Muhammad Yunus during their initial meeting in Thailand at a BIMSTEC Summit, expressing India's desire for ""positive and constructive"" relations with Bangladesh.Bangladesh suspended Indian yarn imports through land ports in March. Additionally, a committee under Bangladesh's interim government suggested closing Chilahati, Daulatganj and Tegamukh land ports along the Indian border, while recommending suspension of Balla land port operations.India-Bangladesh relations deteriorated significantly after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's departure from Dhaka in August last year amid large-scale anti-government protests.Relations worsened further when the interim government led by Yunus proved unable to prevent attacks against minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh.","India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that CEO Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his Bloomberg interview, Gerber defended his Tesla comments, responding to the criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war. In a latest, Trump announced a sweeping 245% retaliatory tariff on Chinese imports.","Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk ‘doesn’t care’ about the electric car manufacturer.

The bridge on the river Magai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/the-bridge-on-the-river-magai/articleshow/120447160.cms,"Locals in Ghazipur district, Uttar Pradesh, are building a bridge over the Magai river

GHAZIPUR: Human will is often the bridge to join the banks of impossibilities. It is more evident than ever at Kyampur Chhavni village of Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district, where locals have crowdfunded and begun building a bridge on a tiny river that has long stood between them and the rest of the world. While the district administration says the villagers were impatient and should have instead waited for some more time, the locals maintain that they waited for at least 58 years.The Magai, a small river in eastern Uttar Pradesh, originates in Azamgarh’s Dubawan village, flows through Mau and Ghazipur districts for over 200 km, before eventually joining the Tamsa river, which then merges into the Ganga near Ballia.Barely 70 feet wide, the river without any bridge has had a telling impact on the destiny of a large population on either side of its banks in Ghazipur. While Kyampur village, with a population of 3,500, situated right next to the river, faced it worse, around 50 villages with over 70,000 population on both sides of the river had to take a detour of 40 km to cover an actual distance of less than 10 km to reach the dist headquarters.Boats ferrying kids to their schools on the other side of the river have capsized in the past. Kyampur and residents of over 20 villages risk their lives to cross the river daily in ramshackle boats to avoid travelling around 15 km on a bumpy road to reach Nonahara market, which is three km away from the district headquarters and district hospital. “Travelling 30-45 km becomes a compulsion if we opt for other routes to reach Nonahara or the district headquarters via Mohammadabad,” said a local.The winds of change began to blow in June 2022, when the then gram pradhan of Kyampur Shashi Kala Upadhyay with the help of Manoj Gupta, the block pramukh of Kasimabad, started work on an embankment along the river with provisions for a future vehicular bridge. However, the project, undertaken under MGNREGS, encountered administrative hurdles and stopped midway.Then it so happened that in Jan 2024 Captain (retired) Ravindra Yadav , a civil engineer with 55 Engineer Regiment of India Army’s Corps of Engineers, came to live in his ancestral house in Kyampur after his retirement.“I served in the Army for three decades and assisted in building numerous bridges during my postings throughout the country, particularly in remote areas of Nagaland and Manipur. Post-retirement, I was disheartened to discover my ancestral village still lacking direct connectivity to the district headquarters. Hence, I decided to build a bridge, and fortunately received tremendous support from villagers and influential individuals, including architects and bridge engineers I met during my service,” said Ravindra, who also served in the border road organization (BRO) for three years. He donated Rs 10 lakh from his retirement funds to the cause and also offered his technical expertise to help build the bridge.Ravindra’s elder brother Kalika Yadav said, “His gesture not only revolutionised the sentiments but also built confidence among the locals.” Ram Naresh Rajbhar , one of the village elders, said, “People chipped in with whatever little they could. Contributions as small as Rs 100 poured in. Those who had no money offered in kind – cement, sand, steel rebars, etc. Others of fered to work on the bridge after finishing their day jobs.”Ravindra readied the design for a 105-foot bridge on the river and the project was ready for a reboot.Accepting his invitation, Allahabad high court’s Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav visited the village for the bridge’s ground-breaking ceremony on February 25, 2024. In his short speech, Justice Yadav profusely praised the efforts and spirit of local residents to do the unthinkable.“So far apart from constructing retaining walls on both the banks, four pillars have been erected. At present, slabbing between Brahm Baba temple bank and the first pair of pillars is in progress. We have spent around Rs 65 lakh thus far and need Rs 30 lakh more to complete remaining girder and slab works as well as the slope up to the approach road,” said Kalika who maintains the accounts of contributions and expenses.The villagers’ efforts were also noticed by Mohammadabad MLA Suhaib Ansari , who donated Rs 1 lakh along with high-mast lights to illuminate the construction site for late-night work. Speaking to TOI, MLA Ansari said, “When my father Sibgatullah Ansari was MLA (2012-17), he had forwarded the bridge construction file to the state government, and upon becoming MLA in 2022, I raised this issue in my inau gural speech requesting immediate funds. I reiterated this requirement during the 2023 budget session.” The villagers aren’t convinced and blame their plight on a lack of political will in all these years.“Since 1967, villagers had started demanding public representatives to ensure construction of a bridge on the Magai river. Before every parliamentary or assembly polls, they used to send junior engineers or other officials with measurement machines to befool us. After being voted to power, the promises of building the bridge were conveniently forgotten,” said Kalika Yadav.The Mohammadabad seat, a stronghold of Ansari brothers, was represented in the Assembly by Afzal Ansari from 1985 to 1996. BJP’s Krishnanand Rai won this seat in 2002 but he was killed in 2004. His widow Alka Rai won in 2006 while Afzal’s brother Sibgatullah Ansari claimed the seat in 2007 and 2012. Alka wrested the seat from Ansaris in 2017. But Sibgatullah’s son Suhaib Ansai snatched it back from her, in 2022.Kyampur village is adjacent to Mohanpurva , the ancestral village of J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha, who won the Ghazipur parliamentary seat multiple times, although the Mohammadabad assembly segment is part of Ballia parliamentary constituency. The district administration has also taken note of the under-construction bridge.District magistrate Aryka Akhauri said, “The experts from PWD and UP Bridge Corporation have been assigned the task to check the structures built by villagers to see quality standards as well as load capacity that it will be able to bear.” As neither any technical committee and experts are involved nor any prior permission was sought for it, people involved in constructing the bridge have been asked to halt the work till the structures are examined, she said, mentioning how checking its strength is a must for public safety.“In view of their long pending demand, we had requested the work plan from departments concerned in October 2024. It was forwarded to the state government and might be taken up for approval soon,” the DM said. But the villagers aren’t up for waiting any more. As the dusk descends on the village and cows come home every evening, they get ready with their shovels, spades and resolve to build their own bridge on the river Magai.","The Magai, a small river in eastern Uttar Pradesh, originates in Azamgarh’s Dubawan village.
