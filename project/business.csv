Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

WB roll deletions at 7.6%, Kol North tops with 26%

New Delhi: The draft electoral roll for West Bengal published on Tuesday, along with those for four other states/UTs under Phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) has 7.1 crore electors after 7.6% (58 lakh) of its 7.6-crore electorate as of Oct 29, 2025, was found to be dead, shifted/absent or enrolled at multiple places.Electoral registration officers (EROs) also found that 28 lakh enumeration forms were returned without mapping with the roll from the last SIR, while ‘logical discrepancies’ were found in forms submitted by 1.65 crore electors.This means around 1.9 crore electors in West Bengal will be issued notices by EROs, to explain the discrepancies and produce verifying documents. A hearing will be held to ascertain the elector’s whereabouts prior to the last SIR.Those who fail to satisfy the ERO will not make it to the final roll.These electors returned their forms with incomplete or incorrect details (the changed rule under SIR Phase 2 did away with the need to submit any documents).TOI has learnt that the ‘logical discrepancies’ include more than six progeny being linked to the same parent in the roll from last SIR, an elector aged more than 45 years who has never enrolled, ‘father name mismatch’, less than 15-year or over 50-year age difference with the parent, and less than 40-year age difference with the grandparent.Though the rate of deletions in West Bengal is 7.6% — comprising 3.2% dead electors, 4.3% shifted/absent and 0.18% enrolled at multiple places — the district-wise deletions ranged from a low of 3.3% in Purba Medinipur to 25.9% in Kolkata North and 23.8% in Kolkata South. Paschim Bardhaman saw 13.1% electors being struck off the district’s rolls.Significantly, the deletions in seven districts bordering Bangladesh are below the state average — only North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas reported higher deletions of 9.5%. However, the ‘father name mismatch’ rate in border districts is high: 15.9% in Malda, 15% in Uttar Dinajpur and 12.5% in Murshidabad. Even Darjeeling, bordering Nepal, has 13.8% ‘father name mismatch’ and Kalimpong, which adjoins Darjeeling, 19.9%.As for the other states/UTs where draft rolls were published on Tuesday, Rajasthan saw 41.8 lakh, or 7.6% of its 5.48-crore electorate as of Oct 29, being removed from the rolls. The deletions in both Goa and Puducherry were a little over 1 lakh; Puducherry saw the highest rate of exclusions at 10.1%, bringing down its electorate to 9.18 lakh from 10.2 lakh. Goa had 8.45% of its 11.8 lakh electors struck off the rolls, reducing its electorate to 10.8 lakh.In the small UT of Lakshadweep, around 2.47% of voters were found to be dead, shifted and duplicate electors, shrinking its electorate to 56,384 from 57,813.The list of dead, shifted/absent and duplicate voters has been shared with booth level agents (BLAs) of political parties and published on the CEO website and public offices. Claims and objections can be filed by the elector or BLAs till Jan 15, 2026. The notice phase, involving hearing and verification of eligibility documents, will continue up to Feb 7, 2026.The final roll for the five states/UTs will be published on Feb 14, 2026.","7.6% (58 lakh) of West Bengal's 7.6-crore electorate as of Oct 29, 2025, was found to be dead, shifted/absent or enrolled at multiple places. 28 lakh enumeration forms were returned without mapping with the roll from the last SIR, while ‘logical discrepancies’ were found in forms submitted by 1.65 crore electors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126028339,imgsize-16696,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-12-17-053601.jpg"

Gang members take undue advantage of jurisdiction issues: SC

New Delhi: Taking note of an increasingly familiar pattern of gangsters moving across jurisdictions in Delhi and its surroundings, Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to consider enacting a legislation empowering a single agency to pursue organised crime syndicate members in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) states unhindered and produce them before a special court in Delhi, Noida, Faridabad or Gurgaon.“Why not a law to cater to the entire National Capital Region? Create exclusive special courts for central laws like UAPA, PMLA and NDPS Act in Delhi, Gurgaon or Noida, where the offences committed under the central laws would be tried irrespective of the location of the criminal incidents,” CJI Surya Kant told additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati.Taking stock of the progress made by the Centre and states towards constituting exclusive special courts to try offences probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi highlighted the modus operandi of gangsters who commit crime in one state and move to another to dodge arrest, delay trial, and take advantage of the delay to get bail.“If a gangster commits 10 offences in Haryana, five in Rajasthan and two in Delhi, the NIA can be asked to investigate which would trigger invocation of the special law to enable trial of the accused in one court in NCR,” Justice Bagchi elaborated.Bhati suggested that SC could take this issue up suo motu and provide a framework. The bench said it is a legislative exercise.In its order, the bench said, “In matters relating to grave offences under central penal laws, members of organised criminal gangs take undue advantage of jurisdictional issues in NCR.For prompt police action, there should be a competent court at one location where such gangsters are tried. In absence of this, hardened criminals get the benefit of bail due to delayed trials at different locations, which may not be in the interest of society and the public. .. It would be desirable that an effective law is enacted to deal with such situations for optimum utilisation of the legal architecture.”SC had earlier directed that no existing court should be designated as special court as these exclusive special courts should be vested with trials of NIA cases and not saddled with routine workload.Bhati informed SC that financial approval has been received from the Centre to the proposal to reimburse states Rs 1 crore each for recurring and non-recurring expenditures towards establishment of exclusive special courts to try NIA cases.Additional solicitor general S D Sanjay informed the court that the Delhi govt has decided to set up 16 exclusive special courts in three months for trial of cases under the central penal law.","Supreme Court asks the Centre to consider enacting a legislation empowering a single agency to pursue organised crime syndicate members unhindered. Gangsters commit crime in one state and move to another to dodge arrest, delay trial, and take advantage of the delay to get bail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126028310,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-07-15-152225.jpg"

Stop over-the-counter sale of SIM boxes: SC to authorities

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said laxity by banks resulting in siphoning of money from people’s accounts due to cyber fraud , including digital arrests, counts as deficiency of service and emphasised that govt and regulators must devise a mechanism to ensure that an alarm goes off when scammers attempt to con account holders, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra .Referring to an earlier disclosure by one of the probe agencies that people have so far been conned to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore through digital arrests and cyber heists, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “The staggering amount taken from people through digital arrest and cyber fraud is shocking. The banking system must have a mechanism to detect these laxities immediately when scamsters attempt to exploit it and raise a countrywide alarm.Attorney general R Venkataramani said, “There are obviously some gaps because of which such scams are taking place. We are putting our heads together to attempt plugging these loopholes.” He said various proposals are under consideration of an inter-departmental ministerial committee to create a robust mechanism to prevent cybercrimes like digital arrest.Amicus curiae and senior advocate N S Nappinai told the court that similar cyber crimes are prevalent in the United Kingdom but more than 90% of the money is recovered and restored to the persons who were cheated. She said the govt and probe agencies must focus on the recovery of the siphoned amount and restore it to the cheated account holders.SC Advocates-on-Record Association president Vipin Nair said SIM boxes, each containing 400 SIMs, continue to be sold over the counter enabling scamsters to use different numbers from the same device to con people. This should be stopped immediately, he pleaded.The bench on Dec 1 had flagged the rampant breach of norms in issuance of SIM cards and said, “Facts brought on record so far reveal an alarming negligent and irresponsible approach of telecom service providers while issuing multiple SIM cards in one name. We direct the department of telecom (DoT) to submit a proposal for the consideration of SC, which may eventually be required to be implemented to prevent misuse of SIM cards. ”Nair said despite the directions, no corrective or regulatory steps have been taken by the authorities. The CJI-led bench asked the authorities to immediately address the issue and take all measures to stop over-the-counter sale of SIM boxes. Venkataramani said the CBI, which was entrusted with the probe into digital arrest cases across the country, has made good progress. The bench asked the AG to place the probe status report in sealed cover. The bench said if the CBI needed additional directions for a seamless investigation into all cases, it could approach the court.","The Supreme Court said laxity by banks resulting in siphoning of money from people’s accounts due to cyber fraud counts as deficiency of service.

SC takes up plea of cash row judge; seeks parliament reply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-takes-up-plea-of-cash-row-judge-seeks-parl-reply/articleshow/126027604.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine Allahabad high court judge Justice Yashwant Varma's plea challenging validity of Lok Sabha speaker's decision to constitute a three-member committee for his impeachment initiated in the aftermath of the discovery of unaccounted cash currencies at his official residence. It issued notices to Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats.The HC judge pointed out a procedural lapse on the part of the speaker to constitute a three-member committee against him. Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi submitted that despite impeachment notices being moved both in the LS and RS, the speaker proceeded to constitute the committee on his own, without waiting for the Rajya Sabha chairman's decision on admission of the motion or holding the mandatory joint consultation.Referring to The Judges (Inquiry) Act, Rohatgi said the committee has to be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman when notices of an impeachment motion are given to both the Houses on the same day.As per the Act, ""Where notices of a motion (for the removal of a Judge) referred to in sub-section (1) are given on the same day in both Houses of Parliament, no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses and where such motion has been admitted in both Houses, the committee shall be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman"".It also said where notices of a motion are given in the Houses of Parliament on different dates, the notice which is given later shall stand rejected. The bench, after going through the provision, observed why this point was not raised by legal experts who are members of Parliament. ""So many MPs and legal experts but no one pointed this out?"" SC said.The judge in his petition filed through advocate Vaibhav Niti, said the speaker acted in clear derogation of the proviso to Section 3(2) of the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, by unilaterally constituting a committee on Aug 12 after admitting a motion given before LS on July 21 as on the very same day a separate motion was given in RS which had not been admitted.""In brief, the above action and all consequential actions are impugned as being contrary to the peremptory prescription contained in the first proviso to Section 3(2) Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 because although notices of motion under Section 3(1) of the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 were given in both Houses of Parliament on the same day, the speaker constituted the committee unilaterally without awaiting admission of the motion by the chairman and the joint consultation with the chairman as contemplated in that statute,"" it said.MPs gave separate motions before LS and RS on July 27, seeking removal of the petitioner as a judge. Both motions met the statutory numerical requirement.Thereafter, on Aug 12 the speaker said he was admitting the motion given before him and constituting a three-member committee as envisaged under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 to conduct the statutory inquiry.","Allahabad high court judge Justice Yashwant Varma's plea challenging validity of Lok Sabha speaker's decision to constitute a three-member committee for his impeachment initiated in the aftermath of the discovery of unaccounted cash currencies at his official residence.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Tuesday said it was unrealistic to expect any elected government to bring down air pollution within a short period, as the Delhi-NCR continued to struggle with severe smog conditions, with air quality ranging from poor to severe, raising serious health concerns for residents.""It is impossible for any elected government to reduce AQI in 9-10 months. I apologise for the pollution in Delhi. We are doing better work than the dishonest AAP government, and we have reduced AQI each day. This disease of pollution is given to us by the Aam Aadmi Party, and we are working to fix it,"" Sirsa said.Sirsa announced additional measures to curb pollution, saying that from Thursday, only BS-VI vehicles from outside Delhi will be permitted to enter the national capital.He also said that vehicle owners without a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) will be denied fuel at petrol pumps starting Thursday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), several areas including Anand Vihar, AIIMS, Ghazipur and India Gate reported very poor to severe air quality. Anand Vihar and Ghazipur recorded an AQI of 410 each, categorised as ‘severe’, while AIIMS stood at 397 and India Gate at 380, both in the ‘very poor’ category.With pollution levels exceeding critical limits, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked all measures under Stage-IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR. Stage-IV is the strictest level of restrictions, applied when AQI exceeds 450, and is aimed at reducing public exposure and preventing further deterioration of air quality.Last week, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta had also addressed protests over rising pollution levels, saying the crisis was the result of years of neglect and would take time to resolve. Speaking at an event in Pitampura, she said the government needed sufficient time to deal with the long-standing problem.""Those who make big statements and protest at India Gate… pollution is not something that appeared today, it has been a problem for years.What did the previous government do? Where were you at that time? This is a backlog of 27 years. The government needs at least 27 months to clear the backlog of 27 years,"" Gupta said.","Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said it was unrealistic to expect any elected government to bring down air pollution within a short period.

Lakhpati Didis: How India’s SHG women are transforming lives - And politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lakhpati-didis-how-indias-shg-women-are-transforming-lives-and-politics/articleshow/126005504.cms,"Lakhpati Didi Scheme: PM Modi Empowers Over 20 Lakh Women in Bihar with Cash Support Ahead of Polls

What is a Lakhpati Didi - And where did It come from?



How self-help groups work on the ground



Under DAY-NRLM, SHGs receive:

Revolving funds (Rs 20,000–Rs 30,000 per group, of their own saving),

Community investment funds (up to Rs 2.5 lakh),

Bank linkages (Financial inclusion is a key component to make SHG members preferred clients of the banking system, which in turn helps in)

Collateral-free bank loans up to Rs 20 lakh with interest subvention and overdraft facilities.

Scale and impact - By the numbers



Why they matter beyond economics



The election lens: Why SHG women are politically significant



How political parties view them



Over the past few decades, women’s participation in India’s rural economy has moved from the margins to the centre of policy conversations. From savings collectives and micro-enterprises to agriculture, dairy and small manufacturing, women - particularly in hinterlands - are increasingly being seen not merely as beneficiaries of welfare, but as economic agents capable of driving household incomes and local growth.When Shashibala Sonkar from a small town in Mirzapur, UP, first joined a self-help group (SHG) five years ago, she saw it as a way to make a little money to ease her financial troubles and access small loans. This year, she crossed a milestone that officially changed her life: her household income surpassed Rs1 lakh a year, qualifying her as a Lakhpati Didi - one among millions of rural women recognised by the Centre as economic contributors and community inspirations.“Our finances were not strong. I used to look for some or other work through which I could support my family. I used to do tailoring and knitting, then I joined the samooh (SHG) and things changed” said Shashibala in conversation with TOI.Her story reflects a shift in rural India’s socio-economic landscape. This shift in thinking has found formal expression in the government’s push to strengthen and scale self-help groups (SHGs), which today form one of the largest women-led grassroots economic networks in the world.With millions of women organised into savings and credit collectives, the focus has gradually moved beyond subsistence livelihoods towards income sustainability and entrepreneurship. And this shift is also increasingly becoming a political battleground.The term Lakhpati Didi refers to a member of a self-help group whose annual household income exceeds Rs 1 lakh, sustained over at least four agricultural or business cycles, with a monthly average above Rs 10,000. These women are recognised not just for income, but for adopting sustainable livelihood practices and managing resources effectively.The idea was centrally promoted by the Union government in 2023 on Independence Day, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi described his vision of making “two crore Lakhpati Didis in villages”, highlighting the role of SHG women in the rural economy.This target was taken forward with formalisation in the Budget 2024, where finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised the scheme’s ambition from two crore to three crore Lakhpati Didis. The initiative builds on the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), launched under the ministry of rural development. This is itself the evolved form of India’s long-standing SHG network, which traces its institutional history to 1992’s NABARD SHG-Bank Linkage Programme and gained scale under NRLM from 2011 onwards.An SHG typically comprises 10-20 rural women who save small amounts collectively, access credit, and then invest in income-generating activities. These range from dairy and agriculture to services and small enterprises. Over time, the groups federate into larger bodies for better access to training, finance and markets.Shashibala told TOI, in 2021 she along with some other women of the community established ‘Om Sai Ajivika Mahila Swayam Sahayata Samooh’ which has been “transformative and helpful’ for her and all the other women associated with the group. Currently she is the only one from the group to be recognised as Lakhpati Didi.She says, “the journey which began five years ago has been slow, steady, but sustainable.”The system has helped organise nearly 9–10 crore women into over 90 lakh SHGs nationwide as of mid-2025.These funds form the very backbone on which the initiatives by SHG sustain themselves. Shashibala has established a Namkeen manufacturing unit in her town with the help of funds acquired through the SHG. According to her, who also holds a senior position in the group, the loans “aren’t that difficult to get” when compared to usual bank loans which require collateral, guarantees and a lengthier process.“When we started the group I decided I needed something sustainable and even my son was planning for business so we went for namkeen business. But the problem was the finances, you can ask relatives for help but then after everything they’ll offer what a few thousands that’s not enough,” she told TOI.She further added, “I initially took a loan of Rs 2 lakh from CCL (joint account of position holders in group), it wasn’t that difficult to get it, probably due to SGH, and further some help through ‘Gram Sanghatans’ which work in association with self-help groups.”She also tells us that although getting loans through group wasn't a task, it was comparatively when she required more capital and her son applied for a loan under PMEGP (PM employment generation program). But, it became “easier” when she became a guarantor in the application and eventually acquired a Rs 10 lakh loan.In many states, SHG groups have diversified beyond savings and credit into local manufacturing, services and even tech-related work.For instance, Sita Devi from a small village in Karnal, Haryana, after enrolling under NRLM, she underwent FL-CRP training and completed her graduation. She later received drone pilot training in Gurgaon. On completing the course, she was provided a drone, which now forms the backbone of her livelihood. She undertakes agricultural tasks such as fertiliser spraying and crop monitoring.SHGs have been mobilised for campaigns like Har Ghar Tiranga - stitching tricolour flags linked to rural livelihoods - demonstrating their reach into community life.The latest official figures show a sharp rise in women achieving Lakhpati Didi status. By late 2025, over 2 crore women had crossed the Rs 1 lakh household income threshold, spanning thousands of self-help groups across states. Shashibala said, “there are people from ‘Development alternative’ (people from government) who work in coordination with SGH, they look into and facilitate initiatives, make regular regulatory visits and they this year in their August audit decided to recognise her as Lakhpati Didi.”Earlier this year on Independence Day when PM Narendra Modi from the rampart of Red Fort acknowledged the contribution of Lakhpati Didis to the economy and women empowerment, Shashibala was among the 15 Lakhpati Didis sitting in the audience gallery.She was also given the certificate of recognition by the UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya in an event to felicitate the newly recognised Lakpati Didis in August.Individual states have also pushed their own efforts: Uttar Pradesh recorded over 17.09 lakh Lakhpati Didis, with investments in revolving funds, bank loans and sector-specific linkages like integrated farming, dairy, sericulture and producer groups. Meanwhile Gujarat reported nearly 5.96 lakh Lakhpati Didis, backed by over Rs 1,400 crore in funds and Rs 3,600 crore in credit to SHGs.SHGs - and by extension Lakhpati Didis - are more than income networks. They serve as conduits for financial literacy, skill development, collective action, social support and opinion making. The government’s own notes describe them as fostering inclusion and entrepreneurship, not just subsistence livelihoods.As in the case of Shahsibala, there is now always a perpetual beeline of media, organisations and people inviting her to events, and ceremonies. She now has become an inspiration for many women, more recently Gates Foundation is working on a series with her, focusing on empowering women, and bolstering the reach and development work of the self-help group network.Researchers also point to the vital roles SHG women played during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, where they took up mask production, sanitiser making and community outreach, illustrating their importance in local resilience.The tight knit network and personal equations provides these women from humble backgrounds a sworn credibility and a standing in local communities, much more than average political party or leader. This has helped these women to emerge as a new brand of influencers - which work probably on a more reliable, traditional word of mouth.As a long-term development project, SHGs are not new. But what has changed in recent years - and become politically salient - is the scale Lakhpati Didi has gained political visibility at a time when rural women’s votes - particularly in swing regions - matter decisively.In the 2024 Lok Sabha election, parties across the spectrum sought to court women voters with tailored promises, from direct cash transfers to livelihood programmes. While Lakhpati Didi itself was not an election manifesto pledge per se, its enhancement in Budget 2024, including the decision to raise the target from two crore to three crore women - presented mid-election year - added a political dimension to it.Political analysts note that SHG women represent a large, organised and socially influential constituency, particularly in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, where rural votes often decide tight contests. Unlike cash-transfer beneficiaries, SHG members are embedded in community networks, making programme performance - timely credit, training quality, market access - a subject of collective discussion at the village level.For the ruling party, showcasing Lakhpati Didis aligns with broader narratives of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and women’s empowerment. Opposition parties, while supportive of women’s economic opportunities, have raised questions about implementation gaps, inclusion errors, and whether benefits reach the poorest households.In several states, opposition leaders have challenged governments on delayed payments, limited access to training, or insufficient infrastructure support - common electoral talking points in rural constituencies. These debates intensify in assembly polls, where the award or denial of a programme’s benefits can shift local votes.Election strategists have pointed out that in close contests, SHG-linked livelihoods can influence voting behaviour not through direct transfers, but through perceived economic stability and dignity of work. The continuation - or disruption - of livelihood support can shape local political loyalties, particularly among women voters who have traditionally been less courted through income-focused programmes.The BJP has regularly highlighted Lakhpati Didi milestones in public events and state tours, framing them as achievements of its governance model. Government events such as Lakhpati Didi Sammelans - where certificates are handed over to newly certified women - are often attended by senior leaders to underline the scheme’s reach.Regional and opposition parties have sometimes echoed similar goals, advocating for rural women’s empowerment as part of their platforms. However, where the ruling coalition touts numerical targets and credit support, critics focus on on-ground gaps - such as whether infrastructure, market access and sustainable demand truly follow the initial income gains.Election pundits explain that such programmes serve not just as welfare tools but as voter engagement levers: assured income gains, community status and local group networks can translate into political loyalty or voting preferences, especially in marginal seats.The recently concluded Bihar elections have put the political significance of these women to the fore. Reports have also highlighted that these women were tasked with ensuring at least 80 per cent women voting at every booth they were provided with electors and were under constant monitoring. They were used as community mobilisers to reach out to women multiple times a day, and encourage them to go out and vote. These women were also instrumental in taking the Rs 10,000 financial aid announced for women months before elections to their communities.The Election Commission itself used the network of Didis for spreading electoral awareness, for identifying Burqha-clad women at booths. More than 1,80,000 women were deployed on booths throughout the state in both phases of elections.In this background it becomes even important to acknowledge that Bihar saw a massive jump of 8.8 per cent more women voting in comparison to men.Opposition from RJD to Congress have questioned the use of Didis in the electoral process. Political analysts pointed out the possible conflict of interest, as to the very beneficiaries of the government's financial aid were used for handling polling-related duties and for voter awareness.In conclusion, with a national target of three crore Lakhpati Didis, the scale of ambition is enormous. Achieving it will require deepening credit linkages, enhancing digital infrastructure, strengthening market networks, and ensuring equitable inclusion of marginalised communities.Politically, as India moves for next election cycle through state elections, Lakhpati Didi is likely to remain a reference point in debates on rural development and women’s economic participation. Whether it endures as a transformative livelihood model or becomes another contested policy marker will depend on how effectively income gains are sustained beyond targets - and beyond election seasons.But one fact is determined, as we live in the times of influencer marketing these women have emerged as the newest addition to that brand of influencers and as a political constituency which no party can afford to ignore.","The term Lakhpati Didi refers to a member of a self-help group whose annual household income exceeds Rs 1 lakh. These women are recognised not just for income, but for adopting sustainable livelihood practices and managing resources effectively. The initiative builds on the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126007663,imgsize-1349102,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image-for-representation.jpg"

From Jordan To Ethiopia: How PM Modi’s Viral Car Diplomacy Is Redefining Diplomatic Optics

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being accorded rare personal courtesies on his ongoing three-nation tour, with top leaders in both Jordan and Ethiopia personally escorting him during official engagements—an unusual diplomatic gesture reflecting the warmth and trust in India’s ties with key partners in West Asia and the Global South.Just hours after Jordan’s Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II personally drove PM Modi to the Jordan Museum and later bid him farewell, the Prime Minister received a similarly exceptional welcome in Ethiopia on Tuesday.PM Modi arrived in Addis Ababa on the second leg of his tour, marking his maiden bilateral visit to Ethiopia. He was personally received at the airport by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali, who, in an exceptional gesture, drove the Indian leader to his hotel.During the drive, PM Abiy also took PM Modi on an unscheduled visit to the Science Museum and Friendship Park, which were not part of the official itinerary.The two leaders held informal discussions during the drive, with PM Abiy briefing his Indian counterpart on Ethiopia’s famed coffee varieties.PM Modi also participated in a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony at the airport and later shared photographs from the visit on X.“Honoured by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali’s gesture of welcoming me at the airport. Ethiopia is a nation with great history and vibrant culture,” PM Modi said in a post on X.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) described the gestures as reflective of the importance Ethiopia attaches to its partnership with India.“India and Ethiopia share historical relations anchored in strong people-to-people ties. The special gesture by the Ethiopian leadership reflects the importance the two countries attach to each other as Global South partners,” the MEA said.During the two-day visit, PM Modi will hold wide-ranging talks with PM Abiy on all aspects of bilateral relations. He is also scheduled to address a joint session of the Ethiopian Parliament, meet members of the Indian diaspora and share India’s experience as the “Mother of Democracy.”Addis Ababa is also the headquarters of the African Union, which was admitted as a permanent member of the G20 during India’s presidency in 2023.Ahead of the visit, the MEA said the trip would reaffirm the shared commitment of both nations to strengthen friendship and expand bilateral cooperation as partners in the Global South.PM Modi arrived in Ethiopia from Jordan, where he concluded a landmark visit marking 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.In another rare gesture, Jordan’s Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II personally drove PM Modi to the Jordan Museum, while the Indian leader was also accorded exceptional courtesies by the Jordanian leadership.During his Jordan visit, PM Modi held one-on-one talks with King Abdullah II at the Husseiniya Palace, followed by delegation-level discussions. India and Jordan signed multiple MoUs covering culture, renewable energy, water management, digital public infrastructure and a twinning arrangement between Petra and Ellora to boost bilateral ties.From Ethiopia, PM Modi will travel to Oman for the final leg of his three-nation tour, where he will hold talks with Sultan Haitham bin Tarik. The MEA has said India and Oman share an all-encompassing Strategic Partnership rooted in centuries-old ties of friendship, trade and strong people-to-people connections.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being accorded rare personal courtesies on his ongoing three-nation tour.

MGNREGA to be replaced with VB–G Ram G: What it is and how it’s different — key FAQs answered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mgnrega-is-now-vbg-ram-g-what-it-is-and-how-its-different-key-faqs-answered/articleshow/125975849.cms,"End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Here are some of the frequently asked questions:

What is VB–G RAM G?

Water security through water-related works

Core-rural infrastructure

Livelihood-related infrastructure

Special works to mitigate extreme weather events

.

How is the new act different from MGNREGA? What makes it better?



Higher Employment Guarantee: Guarantee increases from 100 → 125 days, giving rural households higher income security.

Strategic Infrastructure Focus: MGNREGA works were scattered across many categories without a robust national strategy.

Localised, Spatially Integrated Planning: The new Act mandates Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, prepared by panchayats themselves and integrated with national spatial systems like PM Gati-Shakti.

The new Act focuses on 4 major types of works ensuring durable assets that directly support water security, core rural infrastructure, livelihood-related infrastructure creation and climate adaptation

How will the new scheme benefit the rural economy?

Water Security: Water-related works are prioritised. Mission Amrit Sarovar has already created/rejuvenated 68,000+ water bodies, demonstrating clear agricultural and groundwater impact.

Core Rural Infrastructure: Roads, connectivity and foundational infrastructure boost market access and rural business activity.

Livelihood Infrastructure: Storage, markets, and production assets support income diversification.

Climate Resilience: Infrastructure for water harvesting, flood drainage, and soil conservation protects rural livelihoods.

Higher Employment & Consumption: 125 guaranteed days increase household earnings, stimulating the village economy.

Reduced Distress Migration: With more rural opportunities and durable assets, migration pressures fall.

Digital Formalisation: Digital attendance, digital payments and data-driven planning increase efficiency.

How will the new scheme benefit farmers?

Guaranteed Labour Availability: States may notify periods aggregating up to 60 days during peak sowing/harvesting when MGNREGA work stops. This prevents labour shortages during critical farm operations and avoids labour being diverted away to guaranteed-wage worksites.

Preventing Wage Inflation: Stopping public works during peaks prevents artificial wage inflation that raises food production costs.

Water & Irrigation Assets: Prioritised water works improve irrigation, groundwater and multi-season cropping potential (supported by the 68,000+ Amrit Sarovar water bodies achievement).

Better Connectivity & Storage: Core and livelihood infrastructure helps farmers store produce, reduce losses, and access markets.

Climate Resilience: Flood-drainage, water harvesting and soil conservation protect crops and reduce damage.

How will the new scheme benefit labourers?

Higher Income: 125 guaranteed days = 25% more potential earnings.

Predictable Work: Hyperlocal Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans ensure planned, advance-mapped work availability.

Digital Payments & Protection: Electronic wages (already 99.94% in 2024-25) continue with full biometric and Aadhaar-based verification, eliminating wage theft.

Unemployment Allowance: If work is not given, states must pay unemployment allowance.

Asset Creation Benefits Workers Too: Workers build and benefit from improved roads, water, and livelihood assets.

Why is there a need to change MGNREGA now?

MGNREGA was built for 2005, but rural India has transformed.

Poverty fell sharply from 25.7% (2011–12) to 4.86% (2023–24), supported by rising consumption, incomes and financial access recorded in MPCE and NABARD RECSS surveys.

With stronger social protection, better connectivity, deeper digital access and more diverse rural livelihoods, the old framework no longer matched today’s rural economy.

Given this structural change, MGNREGA’s open-ended model had become outdated.

The Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill modernises the system, raising guaranteed days, refocusing priorities, and building a more accountable, targeted, and relevant employment framework for today’s rural economy.

Why shift from demand-based to normative funding?

Normative funding aligns MGNREGA with the budgeting model used for most Government of India schemes, without reducing the employment guarantee.

A demand-based model leads to unpredictable allocations and mismatched budgeting. Normative funding uses objective parameters, ensuring predictable, rational planning while still guaranteeing that every eligible worker receives employment or unemployment allowance.

Does normative funding weaken the guarantee of 125 days?

Forecasting accuracy shown by FY 2024-25 when allocation matched demand perfectly

States + Centre share responsibility

Special relaxations allowed during disasters

If work is not provided, the unemployment allowance is mandatory

Thus, the right to guaranteed employment remains legally protected.

Were no attempts made to improve MNREGA earlier?



Women’s participation: 48% → 56.74%

Aadhaar-seeded active workers: 76 lakhs → 12.11crore

Workers on APBS: 0 → 11.93crore

Geo-tagged assets: 0 → 6.44 crore+

e-payments: 37% → 99.99%

Individual assets: 17.6% → 62.96%

What were the problems with MNREGA that necessitated a change?

Investigations in 19 districts of West Bengal found non-existent works, rule violations, and fund misuse, leading to a freeze.

Monitoring across 23 states in FY 2025–26 revealed works “not found or not commensurate with expenditure,” machine use where labour was required, and large-scale bypassing of NMMS attendance.

In 2024–25, misappropriation totalled ₹193.67 crore across states. Only 7.61% of households completed 100 days in the post-pandemic period.

These entrenched issues such as leakages, weak verification, and poor compliance required a new framework, not minor tweaks. The GRG Act creates a clean, digitally governed, accountable, and infrastructure-focused system.

What transparency and social protection measures are built into new Act?

AI-based fraud detection

Central + State Steering Committees for oversight

Focus on 4 key verticals for rural development

Enhanced monitoring role for Panchayats

GPS/mobile-based monitoring

real-time MIS dashboards

weekly public disclosures

stronger social audits (twice a year for every GP)

Why shift from a central sector to a centrally sponsored scheme?



States now share cost & responsibility

Better incentives to prevent misuse

Plans tailored to regional conditions through Gram Panchayat Plans

Centre retains standards, while states execute with accountability

This partnership model improves efficiency and reduces misuse.

Will this burden states financially?

Standard ratio: 60:40 (Centre: State)

North-east & Himalayan states/UT: 90:10

UTs without legislature: 100% funded by Central Funds

States already paid 25% materials & 50% admin earlier

Predictable normative allocation aids budgeting

States can request extra support during disasters

Better oversight reduces long-term losses from misappropriation

Why is a 60-day no-work period mandated, and what happens to workers then?

It ensures labour availability during sowing/harvest

Prevents sharp wage inflation that raises food prices

Workers naturally shift to agriculture, which pays higher seasonal wages

60 days is aggregated, not continuous

Workers still get 125 guaranteed days in the remaining ~300 days

Thus, farmers and labourers both benefit.

NEW DELHI: Centre is set to introduce a new rural employment law in the Lok Sabha, proposing to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 represents a major overhaul of MNREGA. Under the proposed law, the government ""establishes a modern statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047, guaranteeing 125 days of wage employment per rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work,"" as per a statement released.The Act aims to create both employment and durable rural infrastructure through four priority verticals:All assets created under the scheme will be consolidated into the Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack, aimed at ""ensuring a unified and coordinated national approach to rural development,"" it said.The new Act represents a major upgrade over MGNREGA, fixing structural weaknesses while enhancing employment, transparency, planning, and accountability.Key improvements include:The Act strengthens the rural economy through productive asset creation, higher incomes, and better resilience:Also read: Rural jobs scheme: MGNREGA to be replaced by VB–G Ram G; Congress asks why remove Mahatma Gandhi's name Farmers benefit directly through both labour availability and better agricultural infrastructure.Labourers gain from higher guaranteed days, better wages, strong protections, and transparent systems.No, the guarantee is strengthened with employment days increased to 125.Major improvements were made, but they could not overcome deeper structural problems. Key gains (FY 13-14 vis-à-vis FY 2025-26):Despite these advances, misappropriation continued, digital attendance was bypassed, and assets often failed to match expenditure.The scale and persistence of these issues showed that MNREGA’s architecture had reached its limits, making a new, modernised Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill necessary.While many attempts were made to improve its functioning, major systemic failures persisted:Because rural employment is inherently local.No. The structure is balanced and sensitive to state capacity.","The new Act mandates Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, prepared by panchayats themselves and integrated with national spatial systems like PM Gati-Shakti.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat government on Tuesday imposed an immediate ban on the storage, sale, and distribution of rolling papers and pre-rolled cones, citing health risks, the state home department said.These ultra-thin paper sheets and cones are commonly sold at grocery stores and paan shops across the state. They are mainly used by tobacco smokers to roll cigarettes by filling raw tobacco inside.According to a notification issued by the home department, local media outlets and social organisations had raised concerns that these rolling papers, commonly known as “Gogo paper”, were also being used by youths and teenagers to smoke narcotic substances such as weed and charas.The notification said the rolling papers, which are sold in packets, contain harmful substances. These include titanium oxide, potassium nitrate, artificial dye, calcium carbonate, and chlorine bleach.Despite the harmful effects, the products were easily available at paan parlours and grocery shops, leading to the spread of addiction among young people, the notification said.The home department stated that the ban has come into force with immediate effect. Anyone found violating the order will be booked under section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which deals with disobedience of government orders.","Gujarat government imposes an immediate ban on the storage, sale, and distribution of rolling papers and pre-rolled cones.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to winter's first dense fog on Monday, with visibility dropping to zero in the city. There was havoc at Delhi airport as departures remained suspended for nearly five hours from 4am to 9am when visibility was below 100m.As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports, officials said. The ripple effect of delays continued long after the fog cleared around noon. At least 100 trains were running late.Safdarjung records zero visibility at 12.30am, things look up after 9amThe civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north India.According to India Meteorological Department, visibility began to dip sharply from Sunday night. “It dropped to 150 metres at 11.30pm. By 12.30am Monday, there was zero visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. This continued till 2am and improved marginally to 100m by 2.30am. At Palam, the lowest visibility recorded was 50m at 4am,” an official said.Visibility started improving after 9am, touching 300m at Safdarjung by 9.30am and 700m by 10.30am, with the sun making an appearance.At Palam, visibility improved from 100m at 9am to 300m by 10.30am, and to 500m by noon.Flight operations were severely impacted at IGI Airport from 4am, when visibility dropped to 50m and low-visibility procedures were initiated. According to live flight tracking website Flightradar24, 260 arrivals and 400 departures were delayed till Monday evening. “Some flights arrived late at IGI due to weather conditions at the origin airport. Since they came late, these flights departed late,” said an airport official.Airport officials said pilots who are trained in CAT III procedures can make an aircraft land with a minimum visibility of 50m, while an aircraft can take off at a minimum visibility of 125m. “However, pilots who are not trained in CAT-III procedures wait at the taxiway after all formalities such as boarding are completed and take off when they get clearance as they need visibility of around 500m. This causes major flight delays,” an airport official said earlier.Apart from Delhi, flight operations were hit in many parts of north India. The civil aviation ministry posted on X, “In view of the prevailing situation, certain flights may be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for real-time flight updates, regularly check airport and airline websites/apps, and plan for additional travel time.”IndiGo, in a statement, said low visibility (below minima), due to dense fog, severely impacted operations at Delhi and other airports in northern India, “which is unfortunately beyond our control”. “While operations adjust to the prevailing weather, some flights may experience delays while a few others may be proactively cancelled through the day to prioritise safety and help minimise extended waiting at the airport,” said IndiGo.Air India said poor visibility due to dense fog hit operations of all airlines. “In the interest of safety and to avoid prolonged uncertainty, some flights have been cancelled,” it said on X.The civil aviation ministry said, “The Director General Civil Aviation has reviewed preparedness for fog conditions. Officers should monitor passenger inconvenience and ensure that airlines are facilitating operations and discharging responsibilities as per their respective SOPs and any directions issued.”","As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports. At least 100 trains were running late. Civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125990104,imgsize-15628,width-400,resizemode-4/fog-delhi-airport.jpg"

Rural jobs scheme: MGNREGA to be replaced by VB–G Ram G; Congress asks why remove Mahatma Gandhi's name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rural-jobs-scheme-mnrega-set-to-replaced-by-vbg-ram-g-what-it-is-and-what-changes/articleshow/125974086.cms,"Congress Questions BJP’s Renaming Of MGNREGA, Hits Out At Gandhi Hatred

Priyanka Gandhi criticises the move



.

What changes?



'BJP-RSS conspiracy': Mallikarjun Kharge



NEW DELHI: The Centre is set to replace the two-decade-old national rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with a new legislative framework titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, 2025. In response to the change, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the government questioning the intentions behind removing Mahatma Gandhi's name.The Bill, aimed at aligning rural livelihoods with the government’s long-term development vision, has been listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha, according to the supplementary list of business issued on Monday.The proposed legislation seeks to dismantle MGNREGA, enacted in 2005, and establish a new statutory regime for rural employment.Priyanka Gandhi questioned the government’s intent behind renaming the scheme, asking whether such a move was necessary in the first place. Speaking to the reporters outside the Parliament complex, she said, ""Why is Mahatma Gandhi's name being removed. Mahatma Gandhi is considered the tallest leader not just in the country but in the world, so removing his name, I really don't understand. What is the objective? What is their intention?""She further went on to argue, ""Whenever the name of a scheme is changed, there are so many changes that have to be made in offices, stationery, for which money is spent. So, what is the benefit? Why is it being done?""Priyanka Gandhi added that the move was wasteful in terms of both money and time, and said the Centre was effectively disrupting its own work by squandering valuable debate time. ""Even when we are debating, it is on other issues, not the real issues of the people. Time is being wasted, money is being wasted, they are disrupting themselves,"" Priyanka Gandhi added.Last week, when reports surfaced about the government renaming the scheme to 'Poojya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojana,' Priyanka Gandhi had said the exercise would be a waste of government resources and questioned what benefit the process would serve.""I can't understand what mentality is behind this. First, this is Mahatma Gandhi's name, and when it is changed, the government's resources are spent on it again,"" Priyanka Gandhi argued, ""From offices to stationery, everything has to be renamed, so this is a big, costly process. So what's the benefit of doing this unnecessarily? I can't understand.""The government would guarantee 125 days of wage employment every financial year to each rural household whose adult members are willing to undertake unskilled manual work. This is an upgrade from the minimum 100 days of wage employment.The bill positions itself as part of a broader “rural development framework aligned with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047”The goal of MGNREGA framed the programme to ""enhance the livelihood security""While the MGNREGA focused on the goal to ""enhance the livelihood security"", the new bill says it aims to promote ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation for a prosperous and resilient rural Bharat"", and lays emphasis on ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation through public works aggregating into forming Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack"".In the statement of objects and reasons, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan acknowledged the role played by MGNREGA over the last 20 years in providing assured wage employment to rural households. However, the new legislation signals a reimagining of rural employment policy as the government seeks to transition from an entitlement-based safety net to what it describes as a future-oriented development mission.The VB-G RAM G Bill would mark the end of one of India’s most expansive social welfare programmes and the beginning of a new chapter in rural employment policy, potentially reshaping how the state supports livelihoods in the countryside.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the proposal is part of a “BJP-RSS conspiracy” to dismantle a rights-based welfare law that benefits crores of rural poor.In a post on X, Kharge wrote: “This is not just about renaming the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. This is a BJP-RSS conspiracy to end MGNREGA.""Kharge alleged that removing Mahatma Gandhi’s name while paying symbolic tributes to him exposed what he called the government’s “hollowness and hypocrisy.” The Congress leader said that the party would oppose the move “in Parliament and on the streets” and would not allow the rights of poor workers to be taken away.""Erasing Gandhi's name on the centenary of the Sangh shows how hollow and hypocritical those are who, like Modi ji, offer flowers to Bapu on foreign soil. The Congress Party will strongly oppose in Parliament and on the streets any such decision of this arrogant regime that is against the poor and workers,"" the veteran leader further wrote.The remarks came after the Centre proposed to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also objected to the proposed legislation and said the Opposition has demanded that the Bill be referred to the appropriate Parliamentary Standing Committee for detailed scrutiny.In a post on X, Ramesh said such far-reaching legislation requires “deep study and wide consultations,” in keeping with parliamentary traditions.“The entire Opposition is demanding that the following three far-reaching Bills be referred to the Standing Committees concerned. We are hopeful that in keeping with the best of Parliamentary traditions and practices, this demand will be agreed to by the Government. The Bills require deep study and wide consultations: Higher Education Commission Bill, Atomic Energy Bill and G-RAM-G Bill,” his post read.Earlier, Ramesh criticised the government’s focus on renaming schemes, accusing it of prioritising branding over substance. He questioned why Mahatma Gandhi’s name was being removed from a programme that has been in place since 2005Speaking to reporters, Ramesh said: ""The Narendra Modi government is unbeatable in changing the names of schemes and laws, no one can match it. The Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was turned into Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the rural LPG distribution program was named Ujjwala... They are experts in packaging, branding, and naming. The surprising thing is that they hate Pandit Nehru, but they hate Mahatma Gandhi so much too; the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme has been running since 2005. .. You are changing its name to the Venerable Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme; what's the problem with the name Mahatma Gandhi?""","The Centre is set to replace the two-decade-old national rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with a new legislative framework titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, 2025.

New Delhi: As hill cities and major tourist destinations face the challenge of tackling mammoth landfills of plastic and other municipal waste, Centre has decided to roll out Clean Himalayan Cities Initiative soon to provide financial and technical assistance. Speaking at a workshop organised by the housing and urban affairs ministry, experts working in these areas flagged the culture of consumption of instant noodles and energy drinks rather than local food, which also generate huge plastic waste.Addressing experts and stakeholders, housing and urban affairs secretary S Katikithala said that there is an urgent need to address growing concerns as cities in hill states witness a tourism surge and organise events and festivals bringing in large crowds.Officials said that besides the cities in hill states, foothill cities of West Bengal — Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong, Mirik and Siliguri — are also included in the initiative.“Under the Swachh Bharat Mission–Urban, Himalayan hill cities have demonstrated several impactful on-ground initiatives and best practices that offer replicable and scalable solutions, driven by strong community participation and supported by appropriate technologies.Building on these successes and with an aim to further accelerate and amplify such efforts, this initiative will strengthen collaboration, share knowledge and chart a sustainable pathway for clean and resilient hill cities,” the ministry said.Officials said that India’s hill and Himalayan states — including Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and select cities in West Bengal — face distinct urban challenges due to fragile ecosystems, steep and unstable terrain, dispersed settlements and extreme climatic conditions.The ministry said, “Following the workshop, participating states/ UTs will undertake detailed assessments to identify priority focus areas, evaluate requirements, and prepare comprehensive plans for submission to the ministry. These interventions are proposed to be rolled out in early 2026, with the objective of bringing about tangible improvements and visible changes in the Himalayan hill cities.”","Clean Himalayan Cities Initiative will provide financial and technical assistance.

Under Component C, farmers can earn Rs 25,000 per acre per year by leasing land for the installation of solar projects.The minister said that for plants commissioned under Component A, the median average income is Rs 4.5 lakh per MW per month, and farmers can earn up to Rs 80,000 per hectare per year.Replying to a question on the National Green Hydrogen Mission, Naik said that under the incentive scheme for electrolyser manufacturing, 15 companies were awarded a total manufacturing capacity of 3,000 MW per annum, with incentives amounting to Rs 4,440 crore. Under the incentive scheme for green hydrogen production, 18 companies were awarded a cumulative production capacity of 8.62 lakh tonnes per annum. Meanwhile, under the incentive scheme for procurement of green hydrogen for refineries, two companies were awarded a total capacity of 20,000 tonnes per annum.So far, four Hydrogen Valley Innovation Clusters — Jodhpur, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Kerala — have been sanctioned, the minister said in another written reply.","Over 7.7 lakh households receive zero electricity bills after installing rooftop solar panels under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. The govt has set a target of one crore households by FY 2026-27, with an outlay of Rs 75,021 crore. The scheme was launched in February 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126010187,imgsize-1091395,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Driving the news

Allies are burdens.

Values are luxuries.

Power must be unilateral.

“We must continue to improve commercial relations with India to encourage it to contribute to Indo-Pacific security, including through the Quad with

Australia

and Japan.”

The NSS 2025

Why it matters

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

Roosevelt Corollary

The big picture: The two-front contest with China

India sits at the intersection of both goals. It is one of the few countries that:

Can match China’s geographic and demographic scale.

Offers manufacturing and investment alternatives.

Shares an interest in freedom of navigation and supply chain resilience.

Zoom in: Quad as an action platform, not a talking shop

The NSS views the Quad as:

A regional security multiplier, especially in maritime surveillance and logistics.

A counterweight to China’s dominance in chokepoints, including the South China Sea and Indian Ocean.

A framework to deepen tech and defense coordination, without requiring a formal alliance.

The maritime logic: India in the South China Sea

It recognizes India as a maritime player, not just a continental one.

It reframes sea-lane control as an economic security issue, not just a military one.

It suggests India’s strategic geography and naval presence (especially in the Andaman and Nicobar region) is integral to the Indo-Pacific security architecture.

Between the lines: Tech, minerals, and ecosystems

AI

Quantum computing

Autonomous systems

Space and undersea capabilities

Nuclear deterrence

India and the Global South: Opportunity-and pressure

India also seeks to expand in the Global South, including Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

The US effort to diversify supply chains offers a potential investment windfall for Indian manufacturing.

But it also means more alignment pressure from Washington-especially on:

Tech standards Export controls Transshipment enforcement

Strategic ambiguity meets shrinking space

Technology alliances

Critical-mineral blocs

Security coalitions

Burden-sharing: India’s special status-and subtle ask

India’s naval activism

Its defense procurement choices

Its cooperation on maritime domain awareness

What India can take from this strategy

What’s next

Indo-US joint ventures in critical tech sectors

Pressure on India to reduce Russian defense ties

Bilateral discussions on maritime domain awareness

A rollback of tariffs without strategic concessions

The bottom line

India has been drafted

""Help us win, or step aside.""

The Donald Trump administration’s 2025 National Security Strategy (NSS) doesn’t just chart a course-it redraws the map. Released quietly at night, the 29-page document abandons decades of bipartisan foreign-policy orthodoxy in favor of a singular, transactional view of global power-and puts India at the crossroads.In this Trumpian worldview:India is named four times-and each time, the ask is clear: Contribute more, align more, expect less.The 2025 NSS is Trump’s clearest articulation of “America First” applied globally-a strategy driven not by alliances or ideology, but by leverage, deterrence, and self-interest.Plus, the new National Security Strategy is the clearest statement yet of how Washington sees power shifting in the Indo-Pacific.China is the central competitor. The Indo-Pacific is the primary theater.Trump’s NSS also shows deep nostalgia for 19th-century power politics. It invokes theto the Monroe Doctrine, warning Latin America not to allow “hostile foreign ownership” of key assets. It praises “Western identity” and warns that some Nato members may become “majority non-European”—a line critics say reeks of racial nationalism.“Certain Nato members will become majority non-European. It is an open question whether they will view their alliance with the US in the same way.”The NSS breaks the China challenge into two interlocking priorities:1. Rebalance the economic relationship-using tariffs, industrial policy, and supply chain realignment.2. Maintain credible military deterrence in the Indo-Pacific to prevent conflict.The goal, per the document: a “virtuous cycle” where economic discipline funds long-term defense strength, and military stability creates space for harder economic measures.This isn’t diplomacy for diplomacy’s sake. India is now a strategic node in an integrated effort to restructure power in Asia-militarily, economically, and technologically.By naming the Quad as a vehicle for India’s expanded security role, the strategy treats the grouping as a real mechanism, not a slogan.India’s role in the Quad (with Australia, Japan, and the US) gets specific attention in the strategy. The message: this is not about feel-good alignment among democracies-it’s about concrete strategic coordination.Importantly, the US accepts that India will avoid alliance language. But Washington still wants interoperability, joint awareness, and shared capability development.One of the most pointed passages in the NSS warns of the risk of Chinese coercion in sea lanes: “Control over the South China Sea would allow a competitor to impose de facto tolls or threaten closure of vital global commerce routes.”It adds: Addressing this threat will require cooperation from all affected nations-“explicitly including India.”Why it’s notable:This marks a paradigm shift. In Donald Trump administration’s view, India is no longer just guarding its own neighborhood-it’s involved in shaping regional order.A long section of the strategy links deterrence to economic and technological primacy. The NSS defines future military power through economic and technological strength-naming:India is seen as a potential partner in building trusted ecosystems, not reliant on China. The logic: the US wants to de-Sinicize the global innovation stack, and India could help build a non-Chinese infrastructure of trust.The document also makes explicit reference to critical minerals and influence in Africa, noting that:“The US should enlist European and Asian allies and partners, including India, to secure access and shape norms.”Translation: India isn’t just a regional actor-it’s part of a global coalition effort to compete with China across emerging markets, tech governance, and strategic resources.The NSS notes that China’s exports to low- and middle-income countries doubled between 2020 and 2024-and now surpass exports to the US.Why it matters for India:India may find itself pushed to take sides, particularly as Chinese platforms become more embedded in third-country markets.India has long practiced strategic autonomy, balancing ties with the US, Russia, China, and others.But the NSS implies that ambiguity is becoming costly. Washington is constructing:And India is expected to be part of them, even without a treaty.The NSS’s tone suggests a “coalition of the willing” model-with partners taking on real commitments, not just symbolic ones. And India is no longer outside that circle.Unlike Japan or South Korea, India is not a treaty ally and does not host US bases. The NSS accepts that.But the broader message is clear: the US military “cannot, and should not have to, do this alone.”India is likely to be spared the hardest asks-no troop hosting or treaty obligations. Still, Washington will watch:The NSS sets the tone: Shared threat, shared responsibility-even without shared treaties.warns the NSS is a “dog’s breakfast” of contradictory impulses—“muscular without being hawkish, restrained without being dovish”—and dangerously dismissive of long-term allies.Chidanand Rajghatta calls the document a “hard pivot toward unilateral action” that turns India from a partner to a pressure point, noting the irony of Washington asking more from India while punishing it with tariffs.MAGA hardliners lament there’s no mention of Islamic terrorism; liberal critics decry the NSS’s silence on authoritarianism in China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.Nato allies privately worry the document is the first step to US withdrawal from the alliance—a fear stoked by Trump’s past threat to “encourage Russia” to attack freeloading Nato members.The NSS’s “America First diplomacy” leans hard into tariffs and reciprocal trade. While it promotes deeper US-India commercial ties, it doesn’t promise a smooth path.That creates a familiar dilemma for New Delhi:The NSS hints that strategic alignment will increasingly shape market access. That could put India in a tight spot-especially if it wants tech access but not tech alignment.Four key signals emerge:1. India is named-clearly-as a strategic asset.Not just a regional actor, but a necessary component of a larger China-balancing architecture.2. Maritime security is moving to center stage.India’s role in sea-lane protection and freedom-of-navigation missions is now strategic, not optional.3. The tech-minerals-economic triangle matters.India is expected to help shape the future of global production and standards-especially outside China’s orbit.4. The US expects quiet alignment-even without alliance.India won’t be asked to sign treaties. But it’s being asked to act like an ally.Watch for:Don’t expect:The NSS is a mirror: it reflects Trump’s belief that alliances are transactional, values are optional, and burden-sharing is overdue.The question isn’t whether India will align-it’s how far it can go without losing strategic independence.America First may not mean America Alone—but under Trump’s NSS,. And the fine print says:(With inputs from agencies)","The Donald Trump administration’s 2025 National Security Strategy (NSS) doesn’t just chart a course-it redraws the map. It abandons decades of bipartisan foreign-policy orthodoxy in favor of a singular, transactional view of global power.

NEW DELHI: Delhi airport on Tuesday issued an advisory to flyers, warning that disruptions in flight operations may persist for some arrivals and departures due to dense fog.In a post on X, Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) urged passengers to check with airlines for real-time updates on flight schedules.“Flight operations are steadily recovering, but disruptions may persist for certain departures and arrivals.

Centre Signals Willingness to Discuss SIR, Asks Opposition Not to Set Timeline

New Delhi: The draft electoral rolls for five states/Union territories - West Bengal, Rajasthan, Goa, Puducherry and Lakshadweep - undergoing phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) are set to be published Tuesday, with sources indicating likely deletions in the range of 7.5-8.5% for all except Lakshadweep, where they may be barely 2.5%.While West Bengal appears set to have around 58 lakh electors removed on account of being dead, permanently shifted, untraceable or registered at multiple places, sources said the number of notices likely to be issued to electors found to have submitted their enumeration form with discrepancies, including not specifying their link to the electoral roll from the last SIR, ""may be far, far more than 58 lakh"". These discrepancies, by now assessed by booth level officers, are on account of the change in SIR rule that did away with the need for the elector to submit documentation at the enumeration stage, to establish their eligibility for enrolment.Depending on how many of those issued notices can satisfy electoral registration officers of their eligibility with requisite documentation proving their citizenship, the EC will reach the ultimate number of electors to be excluded from the final roll. Sources said the number of dead, shifted, duplicate and untraceable electors identified for deletion in Goa, with a total electorate of 11.8 lakh, may be around a lakh (around 8.5%).In Rajasthan again, 7.5-8% of the total 5.46 crore electors may be removed. Lakshadweep will see the lowest percentage of electors (2.5% of its 57,813 electorate) being struck off the roll.Officials said the large number of entries of dead, duplicate and shifted voters could be due to a 2010 amendment in Representation of the People Act, which disallowed any amendment or deletion of a roll entry without proper verification. Though the manner of this verification was to be prescribed in the following rules, this was never done. ""This is why the dead, shifted and multiple entries have remained in the roll, creating scope for bogus voting,"" said an official.EC sources told TOI once the draft roll is published, each collector will share its printed and soft copy with the district-level functionaries of parties. The draft roll will also be uploaded on the district election officer's website.","Draft electoral rolls for West Bengal, Rajasthan, Goa, Puducherry and Lakshadweep are set to be published Tuesday.

The move, aimed at tackling Delhi's toxic air, has triggered a wave of anxiety and frustration among residents who depend on cross-border travel for work and family obligations.According to official records, Gurgaon is home to nearly 2 lakh privately owned vehicles that fall below the BS-VI emission standard - comprising about 1.5 lakh BS-III petrol cars and over 36,000 BS-IV diesel vehicles. The city also counts more than 47,000 commercial BS-IV diesel vehicles and over 2,000 BS-III petrol vehicles, along with around 2,200 BS-III and IV buses.In addition, some 92,000 diesel vehicles in Gurgaon have already crossed the 10-year age limit.The story is similar in Noida, where the ban will affect over 4 lakh vehicles. Out of nearly 10 lakh registered vehicles in the city, 1.4 lakh are BS-III models - 96,210 petrol and 41,067 diesel - while 2.8 lakh are BS-IV vehicles, with a majority running on petrol. Only about 4.2 lakh vehicles in Noida meet the BS-VI standard and will be allowed to enter Delhi.In Ghaziabad, over 5.5 lakh vehicles are BS-VI compliant, but more than 5.5 lakh others, including 1.7 lakh BS-III and 3.7 lakh BS-IV vehicles, will be barred.For many residents, the ban feels abrupt and impractical. Manoj Kumar of Gurgaon's Sector 50 called the order ""absurd"", arguing that Delhi and its neighbouring cities function as a single unit. ""Lakhs of people from Gurgaon and Faridabad travel to Delhi daily for work and other purposes. This order will obstruct the free flow movement of people,"" he said.Subhangi Sharma, from Sector 40, echoed the sentiment, criticising the govt for resorting to what she described as ""quick fixes"" instead of addressing the root causes of pollution. ""Putting restrictions on vehicles is the only thing our govt knows when it comes to dealing with pollution,"" she said.Noida's assistant regional transport officer, Nand Kumar, explained that the ban is in line with the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III, which requires NCR states to restrict BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles.""Now, Delhi govt has gone a step further and imposed a ban on all categories of vehicles below BS-VI. Traffic police teams have been deployed at all Noida-Delhi borders. Such vehicles will not be allowed to enter Delhi. Violators will be fined and their vehicles seized,"" he said.Alok Singh, a resident of Greater Noida's Alpha 1, pointed out the lack of alternatives for those affected. ""The govt enforces rules and bans old vehicles in a random manner. But what alternative modes of transport are available for people to commute during such bans? Nearly half of the population does not own BS-VI vehicles and will be badly affected. This will also put additional pressure on metro services, which are already overloaded,"" he said.Singh, who owns both a BS-IV and a BS-VI vehicle, questioned whether such bans alone can improve air quality, given the multiple factors involved.In Noida, Rahul Saha from 7X sectors accused the govt of using older vehicles as scapegoats. ""It is trying to arm twist people into buying BS-VI cars. This is done in parts to appease car manufacturers who are not getting good bookings even after GST cuts. A complete ban for private cars is uncalled for,"" he said.","More than 2 lakh vehicles in Gurgaon, 4 lakh in Noida and 5.5 lakh in Ghaziabad alone set to be sidelined overnight.

Non-BS VI vehicle ban sparks commuter anxiety

Slight relief, but pollution to persist

NEW DELHI: Dense smog continued to blanket the national capital on Wednesday, sharply reducing visibility and keeping air quality in the very poor to severe range, even as authorities stepped up curbs to rein in pollution.Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood near 350, a marginal improvement from day earlier, but conditions remained hazardous. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that 11 of the city’s 40 monitoring stations — including Jahangirpuri, Mundka and Wazirpur — recorded ‘severe’ AQI levels.According to news agency ANI, 10 flights from Delhi airport have been cancelled today due to low visibility.The Delhi government announced that vehicles without a valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate will not be allowed to purchase petrol or diesel in the city. It also said only BS-VI–compliant vehicles will be permitted to operate in Delhi, with older vehicles facing restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).Poor air quality combined with dense fog continued to disrupt air traffic.IndiGo issued a late-night travel advisory, warning of reduced visibility and slower flight movements across parts of North and East India on Wednesday morning.“In the interest of safety, some flights may experience delays or adjustments,” the airline said, advising passengers to plan ahead, allow extra time to reach airports and check flight status before leaving home. IndiGo also cautioned that foggy conditions could slow road traffic, affecting access to airports.Earlier, Indira Gandhi International Airport issued a fog advisory, saying operations were steadily recovering but warning that disruptions could persist for certain arrivals and departures due to low visibility.The Delhi government’s decision to bar non-BS VI vehicles from entering the city from Thursday has triggered concern across the NCR, where lakhs depend on daily cross-border travel.Official data indicates that over 2 lakh vehicles in Gurgaon, more than 4 lakh in Noida and around 5.5 lakh in Ghaziabad fall below BS-VI standards and could be affected. Traffic police teams have been deployed at Delhi-NCR borders, with violators facing fines and vehicle seizure.Residents described the move as abrupt and impractical, arguing that Delhi and its neighbouring cities function as a single economic unit. They warned the restrictions could disrupt daily work, strain public transport and add pressure on already crowded metro services.Officials defended the decision, saying it was necessary to tackle toxic air. “The restrictions are in line with GRAP norms. Our aim is to reduce emissions during severe pollution episodes,” an NCR transport official said.Meteorological factors brought limited relief on Tuesday, with higher wind speeds helping disperse pollutants and push AQI down from the severe zone. The India Meteorological Department reported shallow fog across most parts of the city, though visibility remained poor in the early morning.Experts said stronger winds over the next few days could further improve air quality, but warned that AQI is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category till the end of the week, according to the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System.With fog, pollution and travel disruptions expected to continue, authorities have urged residents to limit outdoor activity, use public transport where possible, and stay alert to official advisories.","Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood near 350, a marginal improvement from day earlier. 10 flights from Delhi airport have been cancelled today due to low visibility.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125997386,imgsize-23486,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk39s-net-worth-the-world39s-richest-man-becomes-the-first-ever-with-600-billion-worth-amid-spacex39s-valuation-surge.jpg"

MUMBAI: The Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai Police invoked the more serious charge of cheating under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code in an FIR registered against actor Shilpa Shetty Kundra and her businessman husband Raj Kundra. This followed fresh material gathered during the investigation, police said.In Aug, the EOW booked Shilpa and Kundra under the IPC sections of 403 and 406 for dishonest misappropriation of property and criminal breach of trust.They allegedly cheated a Mumbai-based businessman, Deepak Kothari, of Rs 60.48 crore in connection with a loan-cum-investment deal involving their now-defunct company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd.The couple challenged the FIR in the Bombay High Court, calling it baseless and malicious.

Amritsar declared holy city: Administration faces challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/amritsar-declared-holy-city-administration-faces-challenges/articleshow/126029621.cms,"AMRITSAR: After the Punjab govt declared the walled city as the holy city of Amritsar, the district administration is likely to face a challenging task in implementing the decision on the ground without creating difficulties for residents, pilgrims, and traders. Making the city truly “holy” in spirit and practice will require addressing several long-standing civic and law-and-order issues.One of the major concerns is the debris problem, as not only does the construction and renovation work in the congested walled city often leave rubble, but the civic waste that litters the narrow lanes obstructs movement and spread reek in the surroundings. The menace of stray dogs is another serious issue, with animals roaming around religious places and markets, creating fear among devotees and raising concerns over hygiene and public safety.Dr. Manik Mahajan,a senior healthcare professional and civic reformer says a true holy city reflects cleanliness, discipline, compassion and respect for human dignity. “Its essential ingredients include hygiene, peaceful surroundings, ethical conduct, safety, orderly traffic, care for animals and heritage, and collective civic responsibility which will create an environment that nurtures both spiritual growth and social harmony and we are hopeful to see the same on visiting the walled city ”, said Manik.Traffic congestion continues to be a persistent challenge due to narrow roads, heavy vehicular movement, unregulated e-rickshaws, and delivery vehicles, leading to frequent jams and inconvenience, especially during peak pilgrimage hours. Not just the shifting of meat and liquor shops outside the walled city will make it ‘holy’, but the immoral and illegal activities often reported in some hotels and guest houses also threaten the sanctity of the holy city and require strict monitoring, regular inspections, and enforcement of the law.Security is equally important, considering the large influx of pilgrims and tourists, and calls for enhanced police deployment, CCTV surveillance, and quick response mechanisms. Apart from these, issues such as encroachments, noise pollution, unhygienic food practices, inadequate public sanitation facilities, and poor waste management further complicate the situation.Deputy Commissioner Dalwinderjit Singh said the administration is going to initiate deliberations with various stakeholders, including the hotel industry, to address these concerns. He added that all departments will be directed to review activities related to their respective areas, prepare detailed lists of issues, and suggest concrete measures they will take. Specific steps required for effective implementation will be identified and acted upon, according to Dalwinderjit Singh. He also stressed that coordinated efforts and stakeholder cooperation will be crucial in transforming the walled city into a holy city without causing hardship to the people.Mandeep Singh, Municipal Councillor, who himself has launched a cleanliness and sanitation drive in the city, believes that turning the walled city into a holy city will set an example for the rest of the cities in India. He says it will not only improve sanitation and restore the true essence of a holy city, but will also significantly increase the footfall of tourists and pilgrims, who will return with valuable lessons on cleanliness and civic responsibility.",The Punjab govt declared the walled city as the holy city of Amritsar.

RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

Rupee stayed under pressure on Wednesday, opening at a record low of 91.07 against the US dollar, down 0.05% from its previous close, before clawing back part of its losses, likely supported by intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Reuters reported.The central bank stepped in aggressively to support the currency to its strongest intraday recovery in seven months, after it hit record lows for four consecutive sessions, weighed down by sustained portfolio outflows and an ongoing stalemate in US–India trade talks.After opening slightly weaker at 91.07 against the dollar, the rupee rebounded sharply to trade around 90.25 in early session trade.Earlier on Tuesday, the domestic currency breached the 91-per-dollar mark for the first time during intraday trade, touching an all-time low of 91.14 before recovering partially to close 15 paise weaker at 90.93.Traders said the decline came despite weakness in the US dollar and a sharp fall in global crude oil prices.Rupee has been under sustained stress in recent sessions.It slipped past the 90-per-dollar level on Monday and has hit fresh record lows for the third straight session, driven by concerns over a prolonged deadlock in India–US trade talks and persistent portfolio outflows.Over the past 10 trading sessions, the currency has fallen from around 90 to 91 against the dollar, losing nearly 1% in just the last five sessions.So far this year, the rupee is among the worst-performing global currencies, down about 6% against the greenback. A widening trade deficit, punitive 50% US tariffs and steady investment outflows have pushed the currency to record lows near the 91 level.","Rupee opened at a record low of 91.07 against the US dollar, down 0.05% from its previous close.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Wednesday. While Nifty50 was above 25,850, BSE Sensex was near 84,700. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,864.25, up 4 points or 0.016%. BSE Sensex was at 84,705.43, up 26 points or 0.030%.Market experts anticipate sideways trading in Indian markets due to the lack of significant short-term catalysts.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Recent sharp fall in the rupee and crude has been attracting the attention of investors. Decline in crude, on poor demand from China and the US, is good news for India’s macros, which are already in a Goldilocks setting.However, sustained fall in the rupee is accelerating FII outflows, thereby hurting the market. This kind of sharp depreciation in the rupee was not expected particularly after the November trade data showed a sharp decline in trade deficit at $24.5 billion vs $41.5 billion in October. One possible reason for the RBI’s non-intervention in the currency market to stem the rupee slide is that the rupee depreciation is not hurting the economy.With very low CPI inflation of 0.71% in November, there is no threat of imported inflation. On the other hand, rupee depreciation is a boost for India’s exports which were impacted by the Trump tariffs.”“With the ongoing weakening of the AI trade, FIIs are likely to turn buyers in India sometime in 2026. If, along with this, a US-India trade deal happens, FIIs will turn buyers in India. There is a likelihood of rupee strengthening in H1 2026. Therefore, while FII selling is depressing stock prices now, investors should buy in anticipation of a 2026 rally.”US stock market indices showed varied results on Tuesday afternoon, with Nasdaq finishing higher, whilst the S&P 500 and Dow Jones declined due to losses in healthcare and energy sectors.Asian equities followed US markets lower at opening, showing modest declines after underwhelming US employment data failed to strengthen expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.Oil prices rose significantly on Wednesday following US President Donald Trump's declaration of ""a total and complete"" embargo on all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, heightening geopolitical concerns amidst existing demand uncertainties.Foreign portfolio investors conducted net sales of shares amounting to Rs 2,381 crore on Tuesday. Domestic institutional investors maintained net purchases at Rs 1,077 crore.","Market experts anticipate sideways trading in Indian markets due to the lack of significant short-term catalysts.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
