"Bengal differs with TN in SC, asserts governor's discretionary powers on bills",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-differs-with-tn-in-sc-asserts-governors-discretionary-powers-on-bills/articleshow/123667690.cms,"NEW DELHI: Partly differing with another opposition-governed state Tamil Nadu and somewhat concurring with the Centre's stand on the Presidential Reference in the Supreme Court, West Bengal on Tuesday said the Constitution conferred some amount of discretionary powers on governors in dealing with bills presented to him after being passed by state legislatures.When senior advocate Kapil Sibal was prefacing arguments on behalf of West Bengal after conclusion of senior advocate A M Singhvi's pithy opposition to Presidential Reference, a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar asked a pointed question - ""Do governors have discretion in exercise of options provided under Article 200 of the Constitution in relations to bills? How does he decide to take recourse to one of the four options?""The question assumed importance as opposition governed states - TN, WB, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Punjab - have joined ranks to oppose the Presidential Reference. Singhvi had vehemently argued that a governor, being merely ornamental head of executive in a state with no legislative function, is always bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers led by the CM, even in exercise of options - granting assent to a bill, withholding it, returning bill for reconsideration by the legislature or reserving it for President's consideration.For TN, Singhvi elaborated upon his argument by listing possible scenarios: If the council of ministers feel that it is not the appropriate time to make a bill a law given the situation in the state, then it can advise a governor to withhold assent for sometime; if it felt that a Bill was passed hurriedly and required some changes, then it would advise him to return it to legislature for carrying out the changes; and if it felt that the law may be repugnant to central law, it can advise a governor to reserve it for President's consideration.Sibal, appearing for West Bengal, disagreed and said a governor certainly has some discretion under Article 200. ""A governor, while exercising the options of returning a bill to legislature, or reserving a bill for President's consideration, is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers and takes a decision on his discretion,"" he said.He said, ""Governor is certainly not a postman (to do whatever is told to him by the council of ministers). Otherwise why have a governor at all? But this does not mean a governor would act against the will of the people reflected in a bill passed by the legislature. Our Constitutional scheme mandates a collaborative effort between the executive and the legislature. The governor cannot take a combative position to have confrontation with the council of ministers or the legislature to subvert governance. ""Senior advocate Sibal said governors cannot be permitted to withhold assent indefinitely to negate the will of the people and his actions in this regard would always be subject to judicial review. ""Any absolute power conferred on a governor would create a constitutional conundrum. The concept of withholding assent is always temporary.""Sibal will continue his submissions Wednesday.The President sent a Reference to SC seeking its opinion on 14 questions, mainly on SC's power to grant deemed assent and fix timelines for President and governors, after a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on Apr 8 granted deemed assent to 10 bills pending with the TN governor and fixed timelines for the constitutional heads of executive at the Centre and states for taking decision on bills passed by the legislature.","West Bengal says Constitution conferred some amount of discretionary powers on governors in dealing with bills presented to him after being passed by state legislatures.

NEW DELHI: Migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan belonging to six minority communities — Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi — who entered India on or before Dec 31, 2024 on a valid passport or travel document or where such validity has since expired — will be exempt from penal action under the Immigration and Foreigners Act 2025, which came into force since Monday.As per the Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order, 2025 issued on Monday, citizens of Nepal and Bhutan as well as Tibetans who entered India between 1959 and May 30, 2003 on the special entry permit issued by the Indian embassy in Kathmandu, and are registered with the foreigners registration officer concerned, have been granted a similar exemption. Nepal and Bhutan citizens, if entering or exiting India via China, Macau, Hong Kong or Pakistan, will not be entitled to exemption.Section 21 of the Act — passed in April this year — states that any foreigner who enters India without a valid passport or other travel document including visa, shall be punishable with jail term up to five years or/and fine which may extend to Rs 5 lakh. Section 23 penalises overstaying foreigners with up to three years in jail and/or Rs 3 lakh fine.Provisions regarding extent of foreigners’ stay in India and for the purposes of exiting, shall not apply to registered Sri Lankan Tamils who took shelter in India up to Jan 9, 2015.Also exempt from penal action are members of all three armed forces entering or exiting India on duty, along with their accompanying family members. Foreigners holding diplomatic passports will not require a visa.The states/UTs have been delegated powers to enforce the Act.The home ministry on Monday also notified the compounded fines for violation of provisions of the Act; illegal entry without valid passport and visa by any foreigner — apart from the exempted categories — will invite a fine of Rs 5 lakh, payable to the FRRO concerned. Overstaying beyond validity of the visa period will invite graded penalty by FRRO/immigration officer: other than Tibetans, Buddhist monks from Mongolia, and Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Afghan immigrants eligible for long term visa who will pay fines between Rs 50 and Rs 550, foreigners will need to pay Rs 10,000 if staying up to 30 days beyond visa period, Rs 20,000 for a 31-90 days overstay, Rs 50,000 for 91-180 days overstay, Rs 1 lakh for overstay extending from 181 days to more than one year; and Rs 2 lakh plus Rs 50,000 for each additional year of stay, subject to a cap of Rs 3 lakh. An abettor will face the same penalties.If a foreigner visits a protected or restricted area in India, he will need to cough up the same fines as mentioned above. Non-submission of details of foreigners’ accommodation will invite a Rs 1 lakh fine; non-disclosure on foreign students/patients by educational institutions and hospitals, a fine of Rs 50,000-1 lakh.

Wadephul will also hold talks with commerce minister Piyush Goyal, as the two countries look to expand their trade and investment ties.The visit is taking place days after a ""brainstorming"" meeting of EU foreign and defence ministers in which the participants discussed the way forward in their support for Ukraine. One of the measures mulled was secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners, which could complicate India's energy ties with Russia.These issues are likely to be discussed during Wadephul's meetings here, sources said. Jaishankar had told his Finland counterpart Elina Valtonen in a phone conversation last week that India should not be unfairly targeted over Ukraine conflict. He is again likely to stress that India has always backed dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict and wants it to end at the earliest.This was also the message conveyed to President Vladimir Putin by PM Narendra Modi at their meeting in China on Monday. Wadephul has expressed doubts about whether Putin is really interested in peace talks and wants more pressure applied on Russia, including through a fresh EU package of sanctions.Jaishankar and Wadephul will address the media after their talks Wednesday.","Germany's foreign minister Johann David Wadephul is visiting India.

Trump & Pakistan business







NEW DELHI: Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India to further his family’s business interests in Pakistan In an interview with MeidasTouch YouTube channel, Sullivan described the development as “a huge strategic harm” to the United States itself.He was asked about America’s trade row with India and Trump’s repeated claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, which resurfaced after the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir.“I think this is one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy, and I'm really glad that you raised it,” Sullivan said in response to the host’s question, which also mentioned the Trump family’s Bitcoin business with Pakistan and Tim Cook’s Apple factories in India.The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties with India, “the world's largest democracy,” and a country it should be “aligned with on technology, talent, economics, and so many other issues, and aligned with in dealing with the strategic threat from China.”Sullivan noted that Washington had made significant progress in developing these ties. “And now, in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, he has thrown the India relationship over the side.That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US-India relationship serves our interests,” he added.He warned that such moves would worry US allies worldwide. “But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States,” Sullivan said.According to him, America’s credibility was at stake. “And having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”During the conversation, Sullivan was reminded of Trump’s earlier claims about being “best friends with Modi” and promising that the first deal he would sign would be with India. The host said Trump then began “taking credit for resolving the India Pakistan war which is a very big sensitive topic for India saying you did not do that stop taking he does that every day and that like you know hurts their hurts everything there and it like crushes them that's not they go that's not true. ”The host further alleged, “Donald Trump took like his family took Bitcoin from the Pakistani Bitcoin sovereign fund and they brought in the general from the Pakistan to be there and India's like what the hell are you. And then meanwhile, you still have Apple building new factories because Tim Cook came in with the gold bar and he's building the factories in India. What do you make of what's happening there?”Sullivan reiterated, “I think this is one of the more under reported stories in Trump's foreign policy and I'm really glad that you raised it on a bipartisan basis going back decades. The United States has worked to build its relationship with India, the world's largest democracy, a country that we should be aligned with on technology and talent and economics and so many other issues and aligned with in dealing with this strategic threat from China.

And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”Before concluding, Sullivan remarked, “It's a big world, so there's a lot more to say. I'll have to come back at some point in the future and, you know, hit the next 10 topics that we didn't get to today.” The host thanked him, saying, “Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser. Thank you as always.”The controversy comes amid Trump’s increasing business engagements with Pakistan. In April, the World Liberty (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by Trump, signed agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and blockchain innovation. Trump and his affiliates reportedly hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, launched in 2024.A US delegation at the signing included WLF co-chairman and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff’s son, Zachary Witkoff.In June, the Pakistan army stated that Field Marshal Asim Munir and Trump had discussed trade, economic development, and cryptocurrency during a White House meeting. “President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” the army said.A month later, Trump announced a trade agreement with Pakistan while threatening 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods. “We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the agreement, calling it “historic” and expressing hope it would expand cooperation between Islamabad and Washington.",Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India.

PM Modi Will Soon Dedicate India’s 1st Made-In-India Semiconductor Chip From Sanand Plant: Vaishnaw





Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday received the country’s first made-in-India semiconductor chip at the inauguration of Semicon India 2025 in New Delhi.Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw presented the Vikram 32-bit processor, developed by Isro ’s Semiconductor Lab, along with test chips from four approved projects.According to news agency ANI, Vaishnaw said the achievement reflects the country’s rapid progress under the India Semiconductor Mission launched in 2021. “Just a few years ago, we met for the first time to make a new beginning driven by our Prime Minister’s farsighted vision. In a short span of 3.5 years, we have the world looking at India with confidence. Today, the construction of five Semiconductor units is going on at a rapid pace…We just presented the first ‘Made-in-India’ chip to PM Modi,” he stated.Vaishnaw added that despite global policy turmoil, India has emerged as a “lighthouse of stability and growth.”The Vikram processor, fully indigenous, has been qualified for use in harsh launch vehicle conditions, ANI reported.The minister highlighted India’s semiconductor ecosystem push, including the Rs 76,000 crore Production Linked Incentive scheme, of which nearly Rs 65,000 crore has already been committed.He also referred to the Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) Pilot Line Facility launched in Sanand, Gujarat, with CG-Semi expected to roll out chips soon.As per ANI, the government has sanctioned 23 design projects under the Design Linked Incentive scheme, while 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.6 lakh crore have been approved across Gujarat, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh.Industry leaders also hailed India’s growing role. Tim Archer, CEO of Lam Research, said India is laying the foundation for a “resilient semiconductor ecosystem” as the global market moves toward the $1 trillion mark.Kai Beckmann of Merck projected India’s local semiconductor market would reach $100 billion by 2030, while AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company’s $400 million India investment plan announced at last year’s Semicon event.Beckmann stressed collaboration, calling semiconductors a “team sport,” while Papermaster praised India’s “extraordinary talent base” and government backing.The three-day Semicon India 2025 aims to position India as a global hub for chip design, manufacturing, and innovation, focusing on building a robust and sustainable ecosystem, ANI reported.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the country’s first made-in-India semiconductor chip at the inauguration of Semicon India 2025 in New Delhi.

Semiconductor Factories Rising in India, First Chip Ready by End of Year: PM Modi





India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, placing it as a key player in the global semiconductor design ecosystem, according to a report by Bastion Research.According to news agency ANI, the report underlined India’s strong position in the global semiconductor chain, noting, “India is already an important piece in the global semiconductor design. You may be surprised to know that approximately 20 per cent of the world's chip design engineers are based here.”Global technology leaders, including Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, and MediaTek have set up large R&D and design centres across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida. This strong presence has enabled India to emerge as one of the world’s leading hubs for chip design, as per ANI.Explaining the division of work worldwide, the report said engineers in the United States define the high-level chip architecture, such as deciding the type of chip, its end use, features, and launch strategy.Indian engineering teams, by contrast, take on the critical execution work — translating architecture into logic, simulating and testing chips, optimising performance, writing drivers and firmware, and fine-tuning electronic design automation tools.The report stressed this was not a “boss versus worker” setup but rather complementary roles between US and Indian teams.The Bastion Research findings also noted India’s policy push to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem. The government launched the Semicon India Programme in 2021 with incentives worth around Rs 76,000 crore to attract global manufacturers.India’s semiconductor consumption is projected to rise sharply. “We consume about $24 billion worth semiconductors and it is expected to rise to upwards of $100-120 billion by 2030. When India starts to produce those chips, our share will definitely rise,” Sandeep Kumar, CEO of L&T Semiconductor Technologies and chairman of the Semiconductor Product Leadership Forum, was quoted as saying by ANI.The Forum, launched by the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), aims to build an ecosystem for product design, IP creation, and high-value innovation. It is targeting the launch of around 100 new companies by 2035, expected to absorb nearly five lakh workers, including a large number of engineers.Meanwhile, India recently rolled out its first domestically produced chip at CG Semi’s Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who inaugurated the facility last week, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will “soon” dedicate the country’s first chip produced there.The government has so far approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states. Work is also underway on Semicon 2.0, the next phase of India’s semiconductor mission.","India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers.

GURGAON: Gurgaon witnessed severe traffic chaos on Monday as waterlogged roads and vehicle breakdowns left commuters stranded across the city.The traffic police helpline received around 200 distress calls till 7.30 pm, with residents seeking help to move stalled vehicles, report breakdowns, and find less congested routes.Major traffic congestion was reported on the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway (NH-48) near Rajiv Chowk, where a water pump was deployed to drain the flooded road.Also read: 'Gurgaon has collapsed': Hours-long jams force commuters to book hotels; rains trigger citywide chaos Traffic was also significantly affected at Narsinghpur, Hero Honda Chowk, IFFCO Chowk, and near Kherki Daula toll plaza.A video going viral on social media platform X shows the NH-48 jammed with vehicles following heavy rainfall.The footage captures the night-time gridlock, with an unbroken line of cars stuck in traffic, their red and white headlights stretching far into the distance.The downpour submerged several areas under two to three feet of water and triggered a 4km traffic jam from Hero Honda CHowk to Narsingpur.Other bottlenecks included Khushal Chowk, Mahavir Chowk bus stand (where an underpass was inundated), Gurgaon Railway Station Road, Sheetla Mata Temple Road, Airforce Station, Agrasen Chowk, Bhondsi Road, Vatika Chowk, Tulip Chowk, Malibu Town, Bilaspur, Signature Tower, CRP Chowk, Subash Chowk, Golf Course Road, and near Galleria Market in DLF Phase-4.Over 25 vehicles broke down till evening, further worsening traffic conditions.A bus near Jharsa on the Jaipur-Delhi Expressway added to commuters’ woes, while bikes and cars were removed by traffic police with the help of cranes and manual assistance.Commuters expressed frustration at the prolonged delays. Sunidhi Sharma, stuck on NH-48, said, “Usually it takes me around 20 minutes to reach Shankar Chowk from Atlas Chowk, but today it took me around 90 minutes. The roads are broken, there are multiple bottlenecks, and authorities work only on paper. Nothing changes.”Similarly, IT professional Niharika Singh said, “What usually takes 20 minutes from my office in Cyber City to home in Sector 14 took one-and-a-half hours today.

Maratha Quota Activist Manoj Jarange Patil Breaks Fast After Accepting Maharashtra Govt Resolution

Why Jarange claimed victory



Jarange breaks fast



Government issues GR



Court intervention and apology



NEW DELHI: Scenes of celebration were seen at Azad Maidan in Mumbai on Tuesday after Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange announced victory for the agitation. This came after the Maharashtra government’s cabinet sub-committee on Maratha quota, headed by minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, accepted most of his demands.Jarange made the announcement on the fifth day of his hunger strike, saying that the government had agreed to give Kunbi caste certificates to eligible Marathas. His supporters cheered the development, which also brought relief to Mumbai residents.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also hailed activist Manoj Jarange's move to call off his 5-day fast over the Maratha quota demand, saying the government found a solution in the interest of the Maratha community.""My objective was to give justice to the Maratha community. My government was always focused on the welfare of Marathas and I will continue to work for all communities in Maharashtra, be it Marathas or OBCs,"" the CM said.The Kunbi status will allow members of the Maratha community to seek benefits under the OBC quota, which has been Jarange’s main demand.""We will leave Mumbai by 9 pm (Tuesday) if the Maharashtra government issues GRs (government resolutions) on the Maratha quota demands,"" Jarange said.The sub-committee accepted his demand to implement the Hyderabad Gazetteer and assured that Marathas with Kunbi records will be given caste certificates after proper inquiry.Jarange told his supporters that the committee has agreed to issue a GR immediately and that the Satara Gazetteer will be implemented within a month.He added that the government has promised to withdraw cases against Maratha protesters by the end of September. The committee also said financial aid and jobs according to educational qualifications will be given within a week to families of those who died during the protests.According to Jarange, the committee informed him that Rs 15 crore has already been given to the families of deceased protesters, and the remaining compensation will be provided within a week.Later in the day, Jarange ended his fast after accepting the GR issued by the cabinet sub-committee. Vikhe Patil thanked him for agreeing to the proposal and breaking his fast.The Maharashtra government issued a resolution on the Hyderabad Gazetteer and announced the setting up of committees to enable Marathas to obtain Kunbi caste certificates if they can provide documentary proof showing they were recorded as Kunbis in the past.The GR said, ""In accordance with the historical references contained in the Hyderabad gazetteer, a dedicated scrutiny process shall be conducted to verify documents and establish eligibility of persons from the Maratha community for Kunbi caste certificates. The committee shall ensure that every claim is assessed in a time-bound and transparent manner.""Activist Manoj Jarange has been demanding that Marathas be recognised as Kunbis, an agrarian caste listed in the OBC category in Maharashtra. Such classification would make Marathas eligible for reservation in government jobs and education.Earlier on Tuesday, the Bombay high court ordered Jarange and his supporters to vacate Azad Maidan by 3 pm, noting that they did not have permission to protest there. The court later allowed him to stay until Wednesday morning.The court criticised the state government’s handling of the matter and warned it would take strict action to uphold the law. Following this, the cabinet sub-committee met Jarange at the protest site in the afternoon.This development came four days after Jarange and thousands of supporters reached Azad Maidan demanding a 10 per cent quota for Marathas under the OBC category.Jarange had said he was open to talks but would not leave Mumbai until his demands were met. He also said, ""Nobody can stop Maratha protesters from coming to Mumbai by this weekend.""However, after the high court’s directive to vacate the ground, his lawyer Satish Maneshinde apologised to the court on behalf of Jarange and his team for the behaviour of some protesters on city streets.As the deadline neared, Mumbai Police asked protesters to remove vehicles parked near Azad Maidan. Security personnel also cleared protesters from CSMT, where they had gathered for four days.According to officials, GRP and RPF personnel, along with 60 members of the Riot Control Force, were deployed at CSMT in south Mumbai.","Jarange made the announcement on the fifth day of his hunger strike, saying that the government had agreed to give Kunbi caste certificates to eligible Marathas.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday rebuffed political parties' clamour for a directive to EC to accept Aadhaar card as standalone proof of citizenship to enable people to enroll in the Bihar voter list prepared after special intensive revision (SIR) and said the status of Aadhaar cannot be enhanced beyond what has been laid down in the law.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, which had earlier said Aadhaar could be an identity document along with other documents specified by EC for enrolment in the voter list, said on Monday: ""Aadhaar will be one of the documents for verification"".When RJD counsel Prashant Bhushan said EC is not accepting Aadhaar as a standalone proof of identity for the 65 lakh names deleted from the draft voter list despite the court's orders, the bench said, ""We cannot enhance the status of Aadhaar beyond what is ascribed to it by the Aadhaar Act.

NEW DELHI: Kannada actor Ranya Rao has been imposed with a fine of Rs 102 crore in the gold smuggling case, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) said. Along with her, three others were also imposed a fine of over Rs 50 crore. The DRI officials on Tuesday served the penalty notice running 2,500 pages to the actor and others presently in the Bengaluru Central Jail.She was caught with 14.8 kg of gold on March 3 at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on her arrival from Dubai.Rao and others were served the notice inside the jail and they were also warned that if they don't pay the fine, their properties could be attached.The Ranya Rao case became a high-profile one as her stepfather is senior IPS officer Dr K Ramachandra Rao. He was sent on leave after the smuggling case surfaced. It was revoked later.Investigations revealed that Ranya Rao made frequent trips to Dubai (up to 52 between 2023 and early 2025) and allegedly used police escorts to avoid customs screenings. Gold jewellery worth Rs 2 crore and cash totalling Rs 2.67 crore were also recovered from her residence. Rao alleged severe maltreatment in DRI custody, claiming she was slapped multiple times (10–15 times), denied food and sleep, and coerced into signing voluminous documents, including blank pages.Following Rao's arrest, her husband Jatin Hukkeri came on the radar. Hukkeri sought legal relief by applying for exemption from arrest, citing that they had separated about a month after their marriage, around December 2024 -- highlighting that they were living apart at the time the case unfolded. The Karnataka High Court granted temporary protection, preventing any immediate action against him until the next hearing.","Rao was caught with 14.8 kg of gold on March 3 at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on her arrival from Dubai.

Trump ‘Sold Out India For Pakistan Business Deals,’ Says Ex-U.S. NSA Jake Sullivan

WASHINGTON: A key architect of close US-India engagement accused President Donald Trump of wrecking ties with New Delhi because of family business interests in Pakistan amid a visible rift between the White House and administration mandarins on India and the tariff issue.Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who has served under President Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton over the past decade and whose remit included India ties, told the podcast Meidastouch on Monday that Trump has ""thrown the India relationship over the side"" because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family.Sullivan was referring to Trump family ties to Zach Witkoff, co-founder of World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which signed a deal with the Pakistan Crypto Council in April of 2025, to advance crypto development and digital financial transformation in Pakistan. Members of the Trump family, including his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, are reported to hold significant stake in the company.Witkoff is the son of Steve Witkoff, a former real estate lawyer whose friendship with Trump goes back to the 1980s and who is now his troubleshooter in hotspots across the world, including in the Gulf and Russia-Ukraine. The crypto deal is believed to have resulted in Trump inviting Pakistan's military ruler Asim Munir to the White House, weeks after Zach Witkoff met him in Islamabad to promote his crypto venture.Calling it ""one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy,"" Sullivan said jettisoning ties with India is a ""huge strategic harm,"" and warned it would cause allies like Germany, Japan, and Canada to hedge their bets because the US could not be trusted and they could be next.""Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts...it has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world,"" he said.Sullivan's remarks came even as Trump administration mandarins appeared to be dialing down the White House invective against India amid wide coverage in the US media of the SCO summit in China. Many pundits lamented that Trump's hardball approach was driving New Delhi to closer ties with Moscow and Beijing in what some characterized as a new ""axis of upheaval.""But US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made light of the SCO meeting, calling it ""largely performative,"" and maintaining that India's values are much closer to America's that to China's or Russia's. “The Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine. But at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved,” Bessent said.White House trade counselor Peter Navarro too appeared to dial down his diatribe against India, saying, with reference to the SCO summit in Tianjin, ""It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed with Xi Jinping and Putin... We hope he comes around to seeing that he needs to be with us and not Russia.""But many analysts reckon the damage is done and it will be tough to retrieve the relationship. ""Even if India and U.S. eventually reach a tariff deal, the trust is most likely gone,"" Ed Price, a senior non-resident fellow at New York University told CNBC, amid alarm in the US commentariat at what is seen as monumental missteps by Trump.""If the Chinese, the Russians, and Indians get together in any form of alliance that is economic and around the edges military, there's no way that the Americans can compete in the 21st Century. We might as well go home,"" Price said.","Ex-U.S. NSA Jake Sullivan says Trump has ""thrown the India relationship over the side"" because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha Ram Kalbelia, 55, from Rajasthan's Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

""This court referred the offence under Section 138 NI Act as a Civil Sheep in Criminal Wolf's Clothing which meant issues agitated by the parties under the said provision are of private nature which are brought within the sweep of criminality jurisdiction in order to strengthen the credibility of the negotiable instruments,"" the bench said while referring to an earlier verdict of the SC.The court set aside a Punjab and Haryana HC ruling that had refused to quash conviction in a cheque dishonour case after settlement between the parties.SC said when parties enter into an agreement and compound the offence, they do so to save themselves from the process of litigation, allows them to do so. Hence, courts cannot override such compounding and impose its will, it said.""Once the complainant has signed the compromise deed accepting the amount in full and final settlement of the default sum the proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act cannot hold water; therefore, the concurrent conviction rendered by the Courts below has to be set aside,"" the bench said.""Therefore, it is very clear that although dishonour of cheque entails criminal consequence, the legislature by virtue of section 147 of the NI Act has made it compoundable notwithstanding the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the same can be compounded at any stage of the proceedings especially when the parties have themselves arrived at a voluntary compromise,"" it said.","A person can avoid a jail term after being convicted in a cheque bounce case if they reach a compromise with the complainant, Supreme Court says. A bench of justices Aravind Kumar and Sandeep Mehta said the offence of dishonour of cheque was mainly a civil wrong and had been made specifically compoundable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123666358,imgsize-1288942,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
"If we can clear delayed bills, why not perform other guv functions: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-we-can-clear-delayed-bills-why-not-perform-other-guv-functions-sc/articleshow/123664421.cms,"Singhvi: Keeping bills pending without any reason by guv is distortion of constitutional scheme of governance

NEW DELHI: In a sharp reaction to Tamil Nadu's defence of Supreme Court granting deemed assent to bills delayed by governors, a five-judge apex court bench on Tuesday asked - ""if we can do this, why can't we step into the governor's shoes to order a bill's return to the legislature and also reserve it for President's consideration?""For TN, senior advocate A M Singhvi told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar that given the numerous instances of governors in states sitting over bills indefinitely to subvert the spirit of paramountcy of people which undergirds the Constitution, the apex court should lay down a general timeline for all governors on taking decision on bills.CJI Gavai and Justice Nath asked, “If governors do not comply with the SC-fixed timeline, what would be the consequence?”Singhvi said then SC should make a provision for deemed assent — to consider the bill to have been assented to — to avoid exercising contempt of court powers.Cautioning that Singhvi’s argument can have dangerous implications, Justice Nath told the senior lawyer that Article 200 gives four options to a governor — to grant assent to a bill, withhold assent, return it to legislature with suggestions, and reserve it for President’s consideration.“If SC can grant deemed assent to long-pending bills, what prevents it from stepping into a governor’s shoes to exercise the options,” he asked.Singhvi, however, pressed on and sought to justify his arguments by saying that keeping bills pending without any reason by a governor is a distortion of the constitutional scheme of governance and is being repeated state after state.“SC judges are not sitting in ivory towers. They know the ground reality.When bills are kept pending for years and when the governor’s action cannot be questioned in a constitutional court, then the governor arrogates himself with unfettered power to kill a bill, and with it the will of the people, by simply keeping it pending. He, thus, becomes a super CM with a pocket veto, and the elected govt would be a mere bystander,” he said.Singhvi argued that SC has time and again fixed timelines for speakers to decide pending petitions seeking disqualification of MLAs under the Tenth Schedule.CJI Gavai said, “In the Telangana case, it was Singhvi who had argued that SC cannot fix a timeline for speakers. We rejected that argument and asked the speaker, who acts as a tribunal in dealing with petitions under the anti-defection law, to decide it within three months.”Recalling the July 31 judgment authored by him, CJI Gavai said, “Yet, we did not fix a general timeline for all speakers to decide such cases. We left it to Parliament to consider whether the mechanism of entrusting speakers with the important task of deciding the issue of disqualification on the ground of defection is serving the purpose of effectively combating political defection or not?”When senior advocate Singhvi proceeded to cite examples of governors sitting over the bills for years, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “If he wants to give such examples it will be taking a dirty path. I have no objection and I am ready to charter that path also. I will file an affidavit showing how the Constitution was taken on a joy ride since Independence. Do we want to go that path?”The CJI-led bench said, “We will not be guided by what governors did in individual states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Karnataka. We will deal with the Presidential Reference constitutionally and answer the queries on their own merit.”The arguments will continue Wednesday.","A five-judge apex court bench asked - ""if we can do this, why can't we step into the governor's shoes to order a bill's return to the legislature and also reserve it for President's consideration?""

Viral Videos Capture Gurgaon’s Traffic Chaos And Flooded Streets

The Yamuna river, swollen after receiving an inflow of over 3.4 lakh cusecs of water on Monday, has started causing visible impact in several villages of Yamunanagar district. Although the water in Yamuna river receded as it was recorded over 1.63 lakh cusecs at 9 am and 1.42 lakh cusecs at 6 pm at Hathnikund Barrage on Tuesday.Authorities fear major damage in case of a further rise in water levels, as riverbank erosion has already begun in vulnerable areas.Yamunanagar deputy commissioner (DC) Parth Gupta, superintendent of police (SP) Kamaldeep Goyal, and Irrigation Department Superintendent Engineer R S Mittal, along with other senior officials, visited the flood-affected villages of Tapu Kamalpur and Pobari to review the situation. In Tapu Kamalpur, the Yamuna is now flowing just 200 meters away from the village. Although preventive efforts are underway, continuous erosion remains a serious threat.“Last year, nearly 80% of the population of this village had to migrate when the situation worsened. This time, around Rs 7 crore has been spent to install studs over a two-kilometer stretch, which has helped reduce some risk. Still, danger persists,” said villagers during the officials’ visit.DC Gupta informed that after two days of heavy rainfall, the Yamuna had swollen with 3.4 lakh cusecs of water, though the flow reduced to 1.4 lakh cusecs by Tuesday. “At present, floodwater has not entered residential areas. Soil bags are being placed to check erosion, and announcements are being made in over 125 adjoining villages urging people to stay away from the Yamuna. Officers have been deployed in affected areas for relief and safety measures,” he said.He also confirmed an unfortunate incident in which two youths drowned while attempting to collect logs washed down from the mountains into the river. “We appeal to people not to go near the Yamuna, as it is extremely dangerous. The administration is fully alert, and disaster management measures have been activated in view of the weather department’s warnings,” Gupta added.SP Kamaldeep Goyal stated that all police station heads have been directed to stay stationed in vulnerable areas and coordinate with village sarpanches to ensure preparedness. “The underpass at Kalanaur has been closed due to waterlogging. Police teams are making rounds in villages near the river, advising people to remain cautious,” he said.With around 125 villages located along the Yamuna’s course in Yamunanagar, the administration is on high alert to prevent loss of life and property. Relief efforts continue, even as search operations are underway to trace the two missing youths.To strengthen preparedness, a district-level flood control room has been set up at the secretariat. Citizens can report emergencies or seek assistance at 01732-237801. Additional control rooms have also been established across subdivisions - Radaur SDM office – 01732-283899, Vyaspur BDPO office – 01735-297588, Chhachhrauli SDM office – 01735-293400, Yamunanagar Jagadhri Municipal Corporation – 01732-237841/9810336887 and Hathnikund Barrage and river water level updates – 01732-237837.On this occasion, Jagadhri SDM Vishwanath, Radaur SDM Narendra Kumar, superintending engineer of irrigation Ravi Shankar Mittal, District Revenue Officer Tarun Sahota, DDPO Narendra Singh, BDPO Shyam Lal, Executive Engineer Vinod Kumar, and local panchayat representatives.","After two days of heavy rainfall, the Yamuna had swollen with 3.4 lakh cusecs of water, though the flow reduced to 1.4 crore by Tuesday.

'Power of yoga': Sadhguru completes Kailash Yatra on motorcycle; makes journey just 18 months after 2 critical surgeries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-of-yoga-sadhguru-completes-kailash-yatra-on-motorcycle-makes-journey-just-18-months-after-2-critical-surgeries/articleshow/123613855.cms,"Why Is Mount Kailash Forbidden? Sadhguru Reveals Its Mystical Power

Poll Do you agree with Sadhguru's view on India's ability to thrive despite challenges? Yes, I believe in India's resilience No, challenges are too overwhelming

Sadhguru on Saturday completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, just 18 months after undergoing two emergency brain surgeries.He was welcomed at the Coimbatore Airport, with locals, villagers and volunteers lining the route to the ashram in a devotional procession.Speaking to journalists at Coimbatore Airport, Sadhguru noted, “As per medical advice, I was not supposed to ride a motorcycle, yet I went to 18,000 feet above mean sea level. This demonstrates the power of yoga.”Describing how yoga helped him in the journey, he said, “Yoga means you become one with the very source of creation, which is within every one of us. So when you are in touch with the source of creation, this is not a challenge. Effortlessly, I have done this at this stage.”Sadhguru began his yatra on a motorcycle, from Gorakhpur on August 9, travelling through Nepal and Tibet amid rain, landslides, rough terrain and altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. His route took him through Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Thulikhel in Nepal, before crossing into Tibet via Zhangmu, Nyalam and Saga.After reaching Lake Manasarovar, he trekked to Mount Kailash.Ahead of the journey, in an interaction with actor Dino Morea he had said, “I am not going to see Shiva. For me, the dimension we refer to as Shiva—when I close my eyes, that is where I am. I don’t have to go to Kailash for that. Kailash is the most spectacular library, but these days I am not going even for that.”He further added, “I'm taking a few hundred people with me. People when they wake up in the morning, do they say Shiva? No, they'll say stock market or cinema. So for those people with altitude and variety of other challenges, it lowers their concerns about stock market and we can get them to focus on something more profound.”Talking about the tariffs that the US has imposed on India, he said, “When challenges are thrown at us, it's for us to stand up sharper and stronger, which I think India will do for sure. Maintaining India's sovereignty, its freedom to do its business the way it wants to do, is something that we cannot give up as a free nation.”“Even when things are against you, you must thrive. That is the capacity we need to build. And this is a good example, this is a good lesson for us. To make sure that India thrives no matter what kind of conditions,” he furher added.","Sadhguru completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore.

"Yamuna Danger Mark: Yamuna inches close to danger mark in noida, 600 evacuated & shifted to camps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/yamuna-inches-close-to-danger-mark-in-noida-600-evacuated-shifted-to-camps/articleshow/123664023.cms,"



NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: More than 600 people were evacuated on Tuesday as the Yamuna swelled dangerously close to the danger mark in Noida.By morning, the Yamuna's level at the Okhla Barrage had climbed to 199.15 metres, flowing just 1.5 metres below the 200.6-metre danger mark, and was on a steady upward trajectory. At 7pm, the water level was recorded at 199.5 metres while 1,02,444 cusec was discharge at Okhla Barrage.Officials have warned the river could breach the threshold overnight due to heavy rainfall in its catchment and a consistent discharge of over one lakh cusecs from Haryana's Hathinikund barrage since Tuesday morning, which had slowly begun to inch closer to 2 lakh cusecs by 10pm, is set to increase city's woes. It could mean that the river was likely to remain in spate for at least a few days.Yamuna received over three lakh cusecs of water from Haryana's Hathnikund barrage between 8am to 5pm on Monday, after heavy rainfall in the Himalayas. The usual discharge from Hathnikund barrage is less than 50,000 cusecs.The discharge touched a high of 3.23 lakh cusecs by noon, and stood at 2.23 lakh by 11pm on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the discharge had dropped below 2 lakh cusecs. It further dipped to 1.13 lakh cusecs by 8pm before inching up again to 1.8 lakh cusecs by 10 pm.The water released from Hathnikund often impacts the city in 36 to 48 hours.District authorities said they began shifting families late on Monday night, wary that the rising waters could spill into residential clusters and farmlands. ""At least 1,400 domestic animals and over 600 people have been moved from the floodplains. Police and health teams are now stationed at relief centres,"" ADM Atul Kumar said.Scenes of people wading through knee-deep water, pushing handcarts laden with furniture, or driving tractors and cars while herding their cattle to safety, revived memories of the devastating floods that struck the region in 2023.Sudhir, a cowshed worker from Sector 135, carried his two young sons through water after their shelter flooded. ""We had to wade with our cattle to reach the camps on Pusta Road,"" he said, standing drenched and exhausted near a relief post.In Momnathal village in Sector 150, anxiety is palpable. ""Right now, the water has almost reached Yamuna's embankment. Any further rise and it may enter the village,"" said Nem Singh, pointing to the swollen river. His community was among those battered in 2023, when floodwaters surged into 18 villages, displacing 3,700 people and damaging nearly 1,600 hectares of farmland. ""In 2023, it came at night. We had no warning. We lost nearly everything,"" he recalled.As the shadow of 2023 looms large over Noida's flood response this time, officials said lessons have been learnt. Nineteen flood posts are now active, embankments are being reinforced, and relief centres have been readied at schools in Chhajarsi, Faleda Bangar, Gharbara and Chotpur.""There are six flood posts in Sadar, five in Jewar and eight in Dadri. A total of 15 relief shelters have also been set up, six of them in Sadar, one in Jewar and eight in Dadri,"" the ADM said.Animal rights groups have also joined in. ""Last night, we rescued around 100 animals, including dogs, from high-alert zones. They are now safe at our shelter in Sector 51,"" said Sanjay Mahalatra of House of Stray Animals.While the Hindon, a tributary of the Yamuna, has seen its level dip from 200.95 metres on Monday to 199.95 metres on Tuesday, it remains a concern.Its danger level is 205 metres. So far, no large-scale evacuations have been reported along its banks in Noida and Greater Noida, though some residents have taken shelter in schools and community halls.Ghaziabad, meanwhile, is bracing for impact. In Loni tehsil, at least four villages—Pachyera, Nauraspur, Mirpur Hindu and Badarpur—along the Alipore embankment, are at risk as the Yamuna rose past 210 metres near Pachyera, just short of highest flood level of 211 metres. Officials said 1.5 lakh cusecs released from Hathnikund would reach Loni by midnight, likely pushing levels further.""Hindon, though below the danger level, is already flooding colonies like Rahul Vihar, Karhera and City Forest,"" said irrigation department engineer Binod Kumar Singh. Twelve shelters are active in Loni, while relief teams, divers and boats remain on standby. Hospitals, too, have been placed on alert.The river branches from the Yamuna near Sector 150 in Noida. When the Yamuna levels start increasing, the Hindon river first swells from this area and then towards Ghaziabad via Noida.On Tuesday, Ghaziabad's SDM Arun Dixit inspected Karhera's composite school relief camp and directed officials to stock dry rations and first-aid kits.""Pregnant women, the elderly and persons with disabilities have been identified for immediate evacuation if needed,"" added ADM Saurabh Bhatt.In Delhi, DM East Amol Srivastav, the nodal officer to manage the situation, said about 10,000 people displaced from low-lying areas have been placed in different camps spread across over 28 locations across 11 divisions of east, north, north-east, central, Shahdara, and south-east districts. He said that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has been alerted.According to data with Delhi govt's Irrigation and Flood Control Department (I&FC), in the last 63 years, the river breached the 205m mark on 43 years occasions, the 206m mark 14 times, but crossed the 207m mark in only four years, including the 2023 all-time-high level of 208.66m.""As per current indications, the water level will likely touch 206.90 metres by 7am on Wednesday, Thereafter, it will likely rise further,"" said a statement by CWC at 7pm on Tuesday, stating the forecast will further be impacted by releases from Okhla and Wazirabad barrages.""As the water level has exceeded 206.34 metres (at 9 pm), Railways has imposed a ‘Stop Dead' and 10 km/h speed restriction at Old Loha Pul. This means trains will come to a complete stop before proceeding across the bridge at a maximum speed of 10kmph. The bridge connects Old Delhi Railway Station to Shahdara in Delhi and is crucial for trains coming from Uttar Pradesh on one side and Punjab on the other,"" an official said.","Yamuna received over three lakh cusecs of water from Haryana's Hathnikund barrage between 8am to 5pm on Monday, after heavy rainfall in the Himalayas.

TCS rolls out salary hikes





TCS announces salary hikes! India's biggest IT services provider, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has announced yearly salary hikes after a five-month postponement, offering most staff members raises between 4.5-7%. These increments correspond to the previous fiscal year ending March 2025. The organisation traditionally distributes salary hikes in April.Sources informed ET that exceptional performers will receive hikes exceeding 10%.This salary revision coincides with TCS’s plans to reduce approximately 2% of its workforce, affecting over 12,000 mid and senior-level personnel during the financial year ending March 2026.The company's workforce numbered 613,069 at the close of June.The current salary hikes are reportedly amongst the lowest in recent years, reflecting the challenging business climate affecting the IT sector and TCS's financial performance. Whilst FY24 saw similar increases of 4.5-7%, FY23 offered 6-9%, and FY22 provided 10.5%.The current increment cycle, effective September 1, applies to staff ranging from freshers to grade C3A, encompassing entry-level to middle-management positions.Higher-ranked employees in bands C3B, C4, and C5 are excluded from this round of increases.""The hikes will not be paid on a retrospective basis and will be received by employees starting from the September month salary roll out,"" a source told ET.In August, it was reported that the Tata unit would implement salary increases for 80% of its staff starting September 1, 2025.""We are pleased to announce a compensation revision for all eligible associates in grades upto C3A and equivalent, covering 80% of our workforce. This will be effective 1st September 2025,"" stated an email from TCS chief human resources officer (CHRO) Milind Lakkad and CHRO designate K Sudeep to employees on August 6.These salary hikes come amidst the IT sector experiencing cautious sentiment, with Indian IT companies facing subdued revenue growth, client hesitation in decision-making, and uncertainties regarding tariff impacts and AI-driven transformations.In June, TCS implemented revised bench guidelines allowing staff 35 days annually without project allocation, whilst setting a target of 225 billable business days yearly per employee.The organisation, based in Mumbai, has also suspended mid and senior-level lateral recruitment and reduced non-allocated staff across various cities including Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, and Kolkata. The firm faces questions regarding delays in incorporating approximately 600 lateral recruits.","India's biggest IT services provider, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has announced yearly salary hikes after a five-month postponement.

Jarange read out govt's proposal to protesters and sought their permission to call off the fast.The state granted several of Jarange's demands, mainly aimed at simplifying the procedure for Marathas with Kunbi antecedents to get OBC certificates, a process which had already begun after Jarange's agitation two years ago. The state issued a GR implementing the Hyderabad gazette which has records of ancestors of Marathas from Marathwada who were declared Kunbis. The Marathwada region was part of Hyderabad till 1948. A large number of Marathas were listed as Kunbis there but were recorded as Marathas in Marathwada.The GR sets up village-level committees for issuing of Kunbi, Maratha Kunbi and Kunbi Maratha certificates. This will make it easier for Marathas from Marathwada, from where Jarange hails, to apply. The state has sought a month to issue a similar GR on the Satara, Aundh and Pune gazetteers which reportedly have similar records. Govt has agreed to do this after examining legal issues, Jarange said. He said govt had also agreed to withdraw all cases against protesters by end of Sept. Govt also agreed to provide compensation and state jobs to kin of those killed during the protests. ""The state has already dispensed Rs 15 crore. Pending dues will be settled within a week,"" Jarange said.The state has conceded Jarange's demand to paste 58 lakh records of Marathas with Kunbi antecedents outside gram panchayat offices so villagers can apply for Kunbi certificates. Also, govt agreed to his demand to speed up the process of issuing caste validity certificates.Jarange, who had targeted Fadnavis through the stir, demanded his presence to end his fast. ""If CM Fadnavis and Dy CMs Ajit Pawar and Eknath Shinde come, there will be an end to bitterness. Otherwise, some of it will remain,"" he said. He also warned that if govt did not implement its decisions, he would ""not allow ministers to roam free.""After the strike was called off, Fadnavis said, ""I apologise to the people of Mumbai for the inconvenience caused to them.""

Vidhie Mukerjea: 'I was left penniless' Indrani Mukerjea's daughter claims forged statements in Sheena Bora trial; accuses Peter’s sons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/i-was-left-penniless-my-stuff-moved-out-of-home-indrani-mukerjeas-daughter/articleshow/123664425.cms,"



MUMBAI: Vidhie Mukerjea, a key witness in the 2015 Sheena Bora murder trial, has made several claims such as forged statements in her name. She said, ""If such forged statements have been recorded in my name, there must be an ulterior motive or mala fide intentions. "" She further claimed that during her interactions with law enforcement, she was never alone but accompanied by various family members, including her stepfather Peter Mukerjea , his sister Shangon Das Gupta, and his son Rabin Mukerjea. According to Vidhie, these individuals ""fed"" information to investigating officers, making the recorded statements a combination of their inputs rather than her personal knowledge.The biological daughter of Indrani and co-accused Sanjeev Khanna, Vidhie also accused Peter Mukerjea's sons Rahul and Rabin of siphoning her mother's assets. She claimed that within 15 days of Indrani's arrest, ancestral jewellery worth crores of rupees and over Rs 7 crore in bank savings were taken. She believes this happened with Peter's knowledge and consent. ""Rahul and Rabin took this jewellery much prior to the arrest of my father (in Nov 2015),"" Vidhie deposed.She also alleged that money was transferred from Indrani's ANZ Bank account without her permission. ""At that time, Rahul was not working and Rabin was not in good financial condition.Rahul and Rabin had a clear motive to falsely implicate Indrani in the present offence and to ensure that she will not come out of prison. Indrani was left with no money to defend herself after her arrest,"" she said.Vidhie claimed that Rabin even threatened her, saying, ""Your mother has gone to prison for life, and she will never come out.""During her examination-in-chief by the prosecution, Vidhie described the initial relationship between Indrani and Sheena Bora as ""amazing"". However, she said things changed with the arrival of Peter's son Rahul and his romantic relationship with Sheena. She said disputes began when Rahul's drug use and, subsequently Sheena's, came to light.She maintained that Indrani's ""strictness"" was an effort to mould them into respectable citizens and that her mother was never aggressive or violent. Vidhie also noted that she received an email from Sheena in 2013, a year after the alleged murder.Vidhie detailed the devastating impact of her parents' arrest on her own life. She was left ""penniless"" and had no place to sleep after family members, including Rahul and his brother, moved the contents of her home. She claimed that on the day after her mother's arrest, she was ""disentitled"" from her inheritance. Vidhie testified that Peter had a letter sent to the building society to stop the transfer of a flat in her name, which was meant to be her 18th birthday gift. She also discovered her name was removed from Peter's will and that she was never legally adopted by him. Despite these ""transgressions,"" she stated, ""I still love my father very much.""Vidhie described the period as the most ""traumatic"" of her life, with relatives fighting over her mother's belongings while no one visited Indrani in jail. She alleged that Rabin pressured her to oppose her mother, making it ""very clear"" that she was either ""with us against your mother or you are on your own"". She also claimed that relatives started fighting over which furniture would go to whose house, and shared her mother's perfumes and bags among themselves.She alleged that she was ""bombarded with lies and false accusations"" against her mother by Rahul. Under this ""wrong influence"" and media reports, she wrote a book titled Devil's Daughter. However, she no longer stands by its contents.The prosecution objected to the defence's line of questioning about property and assets, but the judge overruled the objection. Indrani's lawyer argued that these issues were relevant because the prosecution's own theory was that Indrani was ""over-ambitious and greedy"" and how she opposed the relationship between Sheena and Rahul, while Peter supported it. The cross-examination will continue on Wednesday.","Vidhie Mukerjea, a key witness in the 2015 Sheena Bora murder trial, has made several claims such as forged statements in her name.

BENGALURU: Users of Namma Metro 's Yellow Line, who have to wait up to 25 minutes to board a train, may soon get some relief.

We conduct trial runs at night during non-revenue service hours. There is a requirement to run the new train for at least 750km before deploying it for commercial operations. It will take another 7-8 days to complete all the required tests. We should be able to induct the train by the second week of Sept,"" a BMRCL official said.Sources said Titagarh Rail Systems, which reached an agreement with CRRC Nanjing, a China-based firm for local production, is likely to dispatch the fifth trainset by mid-Sept.Though BMRCL expects the arrival of the fifth train in Sept, delays in the supply of bogies from CRRC to Titagarh Rail Systems will impact the manufacturing of the sixth trainset and subsequent ones. A source in BMRCL said as per the agreement between CRRC and its local manufacturer, motorised bogies, which include various components such as wheelsets, traction motors, gearboxes, suspension systems, and others, are sourced from China.""As per the agreement between CRRC and Titagarh, the bogies required for local manufacturing are being sourced from China. However, there has been a delay in the delivery of these bogies, which are essential for the local production. Consequently, the production of the sixth trainset is anticipated to be postponed by 2-3 weeks. A team will soon visit Kolkata to hold a meeting aimed at resolving these issues,"" a BMRCL source said.Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya said to avoid delays in manufacturing the coaches, there is an urgent need for airfreight of bogies required for at least two trainsets.""I had a detailed conversation with the MD of Titagarh on speedy supply of more trains for the Yellow Line Metro. He informed me they are ready to deliver up to eight trains by Sept 30; all other materials are ready except the bogies, which CRRC must bring from China. The only practical solution is for CRRC to airfreight bogies for two trains. If shipped by sea, delivery will slip by 30-45 days, causing further avoidable delays. ..

Marc Benioff's July stance on AI unemployment vs. September reality

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced the company has cut 4,000 customer support positions, reducing its support workforce from 9,000 to 5,000 employees as AI agents increasingly handle customer service tasks. The dramatic workforce reduction represents nearly a 45% cut in the support division at the cloud software company.""I was able to rebalance my head count on my support,"" Benioff said during an appearance on the "" Logan Bartlett "" podcast released Friday, as quoted in a Business Insider report. ""I've reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need less heads.""The job cuts come as Salesforce deploys AI agents that now handle 50% of customer conversations, with human agents managing the remaining half. Benioff described it as ""eight of the most exciting months of my career"" while explaining how AI technology has transformed the company's operations.The implementation extends beyond customer support into sales operations, where AI agents are addressing a significant backlog. Benioff revealed that Salesforce had accumulated over 100 million uncalled sales leads over 26 years due to insufficient staffing.""There were more than 100 million leads that we have not called back at Salesforce in the last 26 years because we have not had enough people,"" he explained. ""But we now have an agentic sales that is calling back every person that contacts us.""The company uses an ""omnichannel supervisor"" system that coordinates collaboration between human and AI agents, allowing AI to recognise when tasks require human intervention.Benioff compared this handoff process to Tesla's self-driving feature, explaining that AI agents can determine when they need human assistance, similar to how ""you're in your Tesla and all of a sudden it's self-driving and goes, 'Oh, I don't know actually know what's happening, you take over.'""The workforce reduction marks a stark contrast to Benioff's July 2025 statements, when he argued that AI wouldn't lead to mass unemployment. In a Fortune interview, he emphasized that AI would augment rather than replace workers, stating ""the humans are not going away"" and dismissing ""scary narratives"" about AI layoffs.Just two months earlier, Benioff had positioned himself against AI startup CEOs like Anthropic's Dario Amodei who predicted massive white-collar displacement. He argued that AI's current accuracy limitations, around 90% even with company data, meant ""you need the human in the loop."" Benioff insisted that while AI enhances productivity, it doesn't replace workers because ""AIs can't fact check because they don't have that level of accuracy.""The Salesforce CEO had even announced in July that the company wouldn't hire additional software engineers, customer service agents, or lawyers, but was adding sales staff to help customers adopt AI technology. Salesforce employed 76,453 people across all divisions as of January 2025, making the 4,000 support cuts represent roughly 5% of the total workforce.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced the company has cut 4,000 customer support positions.

Population collapse: Elon Musk’s ongoing concern



A global warning by Tesla CEO Elon Musk



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has one again stirred debate over global population decline . Musk recently responded to a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man. The post shared consists of a video in which a Pakistani man was seen claiming that Danes will soon be ‘exterminated’ in their own country and replaced by Pakistanis . Musk has now responded to the video claiming that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct.In the video shared a Pakistani man can be seen arguing with a Danish man surrounded by cops. The Pakistani man said, “We shall stay sitting on your hearts for the rest of life man, we have got 5 children and you have only 1 and 2.”“In the next 10-15 years there will be more Pakistanis than Danes in this country,” added the Pakistani.The Pakistani further stated “Danes are just 5 million and soon you will be exterminated. Look at Swedes, look at Norwegians, look at Finnish. We are in millions.”Another Pakistani man present in the same video said, “I got married and I am also having 5 kids tomorrow. So, go and give birth to more children man.”Replying to this video shared on X, Elon Musk replied that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct. “His math is correct,” wrote Musk.Elon Musk’s comment aligns with his repeated assertions that population collapse—not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Elon Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.Recently, Elon Musk issued a stark warning about Japan. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “Japan will lose almost a million people this year.” In the post, Musk said that this demographic was set in motion half a century ago adding that the population decline in the country “has nothing to do with AI.” “AI is the only hope for turning this around,” the tech CEO further stated.Elon Musk was responding to an X post that said: “Japan's population falling with 900,000 more deaths than births in 2024”.Recently, a report claimed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he was willing to help him finance $97.4 billion to take over ChatGPT maker OpenAI.","Elon Musk responded to a video shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man.

AI transformation requires companies to fundamentally rewire operations

When Accenture CEO Julie Sweet needed to announce the largest organizational restructure in the consulting giant's history, she deliberately chose not to send a company-wide memo to her 770,000-person workforce. Instead, Sweet opted for a direct video message to communicate the sweeping changes across 120 countries, breaking decades of corporate tradition.""Reading it on a piece of paper would not have conveyed the why in the same way as hearing it—hearing the excitement in my voice, understanding the passion we have for why we're changing,"" Sweet told Fortune in a recent interview.The Dublin-based company, which generated $64.9 billion in fiscal 2024, serves more than 9,000 clients worldwide. Sweet's restructuring represents what she describes as reversing ""five decades of how we're working,"" bringing together previously siloed business units to better serve clients seeking comprehensive digital transformation.Sweet's communication strategy reflects her belief that major organizational changes require both analytical foundation and human connection. She refined her message through multiple iterations with her leadership team, ensuring it would resonate at every organisational level.""I try to have no ego on communication, because it's so important that we're really clear,"" Sweet explained, noting that all her direct reports work with speech coaches to improve their communication skills.The transformation wasn't driven by cost-cutting but by client needs and Accenture's strategy to become the ""reinvention partner of choice"" for businesses navigating technological change. Sweet acknowledges the restructure inevitably uncovered efficiencies and duplications along the way.Under Sweet's leadership since 2019, Accenture's revenue has grown more than 50%. As the first woman to lead the company and its first CEO who didn't start straight out of college, she brings an outsider's perspective from her background as a corporate lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore.""In order to capture the opportunity with AI, you really have to be willing to rewire your company,"" Sweet said, offering advice she frequently shares with Fortune 500 CEOs.

‘No tax on tips’: Streamers and influencers included in the US Act; mid-level creators benefit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tax-on-tips-streamers-and-influencers-included-in-the-us-act-mid-level-creators-benefit/articleshow/123667981.cms,"AI image





Digital content creators, including streamers and influencers, will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year. The move comes under Donald Trump’s “no tax on tips” policy, a key campaign promise passed by Congress in July.According to a draft list of eligible jobs, reported by Axios, the policy covers workers who earn tips “customarily and regularly.” This includes online video creators, podcasters, social media influencers, and streamers. It also applies to food service staff, musicians, dancers, and hospitality workers.The law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 of tip income, with the benefit phasing out for individuals earning more than $150,000 or couples earning above $300,000 annually. Top-earning creators on platforms like Twitch and TikTok will not qualify, but mid-level influencers and small streamers are expected to benefit.On digital platforms, tips are often called by different names—Twitch “bits,” TikTok “gifts,” YouTube “Super Chats,” and OnlyFans “tip menus.” For creators who rely on this income, the deduction could ease tax pressure.The policy takes effect immediately, meaning qualifying workers can claim deductions for tips received in 2024 when they file their returns early next year. However, the scheme is temporary and set to expire after 2028 unless extended by Congress.The Republican senate of the US unanimously passed the “no tax on tips” bill in May. Surprisingly, the “no tax on tips” provision received unanimous bipartisan acceptance.","Digital content creators will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year.

The upcoming GST Council meeting could influence market sentiment.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “With global uncertainty on the rise, the market also is going to experience high volatility. There are potentially positive and negative news that can impact the market, going forward. On the negative front, the likelihood of the 25 % penal tariff imposed on India getting withdrawn is getting difficult since India has refused to accept Trump’s dictates. ”“This means, in the short-run our exports and related jobs will continue to suffer. On the positive front, the Q1 GDP growth number at 7.8% indicates growth momentum in the economy.This will get accelerated by the coming reforms in GST. The net result of all these can be an upward revision in the earnings growth for FY26 and FY 27. This has the potential to turn FIIs into buyers in India triggering a rally in the market. This is a likely scenario which can play out in a few weeks. ”“Also, the situation may dramatically change if the US Supreme Court disallows the appeal from the US administration regarding Trump’s tariffs. Volatile days ahead. Investors should stay invested and slowly accumulate high quality, fairly valued stocks.”US equities began September with significant losses on Tuesday as traders assessed implications of a federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Donald Trump's tariffs unlawful.Bond markets stabilised in early Asian trading whilst corporate debt issuance and concerns about developed nations' fiscal positions affected both fixed income and equity markets.The price of gold maintained its upward trajectory on Wednesday, remaining steady above $3,500, as investors increasingly anticipate a reduction in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve this September.Foreign portfolio investors recorded net sales of Rs 1,159 crore on Tuesday, while domestic institutional investors made net purchases worth Rs 2,549 crore.","Nifty50 was near 24,600, BSE Sensex was up over 50 points.
