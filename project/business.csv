"Bihar elections: With NDA sweep, number of M-Y MLAs in Bihar hits a low",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-with-nda-sweep-number-of-m-y-mlas-in-bihar-hits-a-low/articleshow/125374331.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: In an election marked by determined consolidation of votes against the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (MGB), the social composition of the newly elected MLAs too has changed strikingly with the share of Muslims and Yadavs hitting a low. What is just as striking : NDA now boasts more Yadav MLAs than the MGB.The decline in the M-Y block has seen a corresponding rise in MLAs belonging to other voting blocs - from non-Yadav OBCs to Extremely Backward Classes and upper castes - which is evidence of RJD's abysmal failure to expand its support base meaningfully beyond its traditional Muslim-Yadav base.Muslims at 17.7% and Yadavs at 14.3% make up the two biggest voting groups, but they have not been able to harness their numbers due to a larger counter-consolidation of other communities since 2005 when Nitish Kumar-led NDA to its first assembly poll win. The 2015 poll when Nitish had aligned with MGB was an exception.Muslim representation in the 243-member assembly is the lowest now, with only 11 as against 19 in 2020. The number of Yadav MLAs has shrunk by almost half to 28 from 55. The number of MLAs from the most populous caste is the lowest in the post-Mandal era, which saw the community fuelling Lalu Prasad's rise, with RJD governing Bihar from 1990 to 2005.What is equally telling is that it is not RJD but the Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM that now has the most Muslim MLAs (5).RJD has 3, Congress 2, and JDU 1, with the last being the lone Muslim representative from NDA.Muslims' preference for AIMIM, at least in seats where their numbers are decisive, convey their growing impatience with ""secular"" formations which, the community complains, bank on their solid support but fight shy of airing their issues or giving them proportionate representation fearing Hindu consolidation.Some opposition netas are of the view that Muslims began rallying behind AIMIM, especially in Seemanchal, after MGB named Mukesh Sahani, whose caste accounts for just around 2.6% of the population, as its deputy CM candidate. That RJD had given tickets to only 18 Muslims as against 51 Yadavs also irked Muslims, especially the young population, and a section of them broke ranks to back Owaisi.In NDA, JDU had given tickets to 4 Muslims and LJP(RV) to 1, but only one of them, Zama Khan, a minister in the outgoing govt, could win.As Yadavs appeared to consolidate behind MGB, NDA gave them fewer seats. JDU, which has traditionally fielded a decent number of Muslim candidates, also cut down from eight in 2020 to four due to a perceived lack of support over its alliance with BJP. However, the overwhelming victory of NDA has led to the unusual scenario of its having more Yadav lawmakers (15) in the assembly than MGB (12). Incidentally, the lone BSP MLA is also a Yadav.Though Muslim-Yadav representation corresponds with the fortunes of MGB, the polarisation and counter-polarisation witnessed in this election as the NDA campaign foregrounded the misrule associated with the 'jungle raaj' of RJD, has especially hit the two communities.","Muslims at 17.7% and Yadavs at 14.3% make up the two biggest voting groups.

Rudra may change how Army operates: Upgrade likely from ‘Cold Start’ to ‘Cold Strike’ doctrine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rudra-may-change-how-army-operates/articleshow/125374266.cms,"CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: With the successful testing of a newly-raised integrated 'Rudra' all-arms brigade in the major tri-Service Trishul exercise on the western front with Pakistan, the Army may now well upgrade its ‘Cold Start’ doctrine to 'Cold Strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.This doctrinal evolution has gained ground after Southern Army Command chief Lt-General Dhiraj Seth said performance of the Rudra brigade under the 12 `Konark’ Corps, with integration of all fighting arms backed by combat support and logistics, was “fully validated operationally” during the `Akhand Prahar’ drills in the desert sector under the just-concluded Trishul exercise.“Now, with the Rudra brigade, the time has come to change the Cold Start doctrine into the Cold Strike one. I am fully satisfied that the Rudra brigades in the coming times will be successful in multi-domain operations and executing their task effectively against the enemy,” Lt-Gen Seth said.The Army had formulated its “pro-active conventional war strategy”, colloquially called the Cold Start doctrine, after its “strike formations” under Operation Parakram took almost a month to mobilise at the border launch pads against Pakistan in wake of the terror attack on Parliament in Dec 2001.By that time, Pakistan had shored up its defences, and the US also had jumped in to pressurize India against launching any cross-border attack. Having learnt a harsh operational lesson, the Army since then has been refining its strategy for faster mobilisation for multiple but limited offensives into enemy territory under the nuclear overhang.Pakistan, which does not have a “no first-use” nuclear policy like India, in turn, took to brandishing its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other nuclear-capable missiles as an effective counter to the Cold Start conventional military strategy.Now, the 11.5-lakh strong Army is converting a few of its over 250 single-arm brigades (each has over 3,000 troops) into Rudra all-arms brigades, with integration of infantry, mechanized infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, air defence, engineers, signals and drone units, along with logistics and combat-support elements.In effect, a Rudra brigade brings together all fighting arms and support units into a self-contained group even during peacetime to ensure much better cohesion and faster mobilization for combined arms operations.Two Rudra brigades have already come up on the northern borders with China, one in eastern Ladakh and the other in Sikkim. “Each Rudra brigade will be tailor-made as per its earmarked area of operation, the type of terrain there and the operational task to be executed. The brigades will have units that can be attached or detached as per the requirements,” an officer said.As for the `Akhand Prahar’ drills, the “full-spectrum combat readiness” of the Konark Corps was validated through integrated employment of all arms and services from mechanised and infantry manoeuvres to the execution of land operations by the Rudra Brigade called ‘Black Mace’, special heliborne operations, and coordinated attack helicopter missions. “It also witnessed seamless synergy between the Army and IAF, with fighter ground attack missions in close support of the land forces,” another officer said.","The Army may now well upgrade its 'Cold Start' doctrine to 'Cold Strike' for swifter and greater offensive thrusts into enemy territory.

LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Investigators are racing to close the arc of a Jaish-e-Mohammed project they said was years in the making - one that turned a campus doctor into ""Madam Surgeon"" of a cross-border terrorist blueprint.The alleged architect linking these threads is 43-year-old Dr Shaheen Shahid - ""Madam Surgeon"" in the underground lexicon of the JeM module of medics accused of the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast and preparing coordinated terrorist strikes on six cities, investigators said.Investigators described Shaheen, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset. Seized digital evidence, handwritten diaries and planning notes - now central to the case - describe a plan for a Dec 6 strike aimed at ""avenging"" the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition The papers outline ""D-6 Mission"", target lists, recruitment pitches, fund movements and secure communication protocols. Investigators also identified roles assigned to Kashmiri doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Umar Un Nabi, alongside Shaheen, who allegedly joined a deeper JeM-backed structure in 2021.The probe has allegedly uncovered an Rs 20-lakh hawala channel routed through a JeM handler for operational use by Umar, Muzammil and Shaheen - money suspected to have funded recruitment, safe houses, secure phones and reconnaissance.Agencies have begun an audit of Shaheen's financial footprint, scrutinising every high-value transfer, cash withdrawal and unexplained deposit across her three Kanpur accounts, two Lucknow accounts and two Delhi accounts. The hunt: any tie to the foreign-funded module.Teams are also reconstructing Shaheen's movements in Kanpur, especially at GSVM Medical College, where she worked until her unexplained disappearance. Officials are collecting entry logs, duty rosters, visitor lists and details of where she stayed between Jan and Oct 2025. Colleagues remembered a soft-spoken doctor from Lucknow who rarely took leave, brought her young child to duty because there was ""no one at home"", and avoided speaking about her divorce. She lived in an L-Block campus residence, maintained cordial ties with women co-workers, and vanished in Dec 2013 after handing over HOD responsibilities, promising to return by Jan 4, 2014. She never did. For nearly a year, official letters went unanswered. In 2016, two staffers sent to her registered address found it incorrect. She was formally dismissed in 2021.Interrogations showed that in March 2022, the module travelled to Turkiye for a meeting with ISI handler Abu Ukasha, allegedly securing a ""green signal"" for the Dec 6 plan. The timeline under reconstruction spans 2010 ideological drift, 2015-16 induction into JeM circles, and structured planning from 2021 as part of a project backed by Pakistan-based handlers.A former GSVM staffer recalled her transformation beginning around 2010 after contact with an Indian-origin doctor abroad who shared ideological videos and literature. She soon adopted new attire, including a hijab, and repeatedly spoke of relocating overseas.According to officials, her ideological shift was unmistakable by 2021. When confronted by a relative about abandoning her marriage, job and family, she allegedly said: ""I have lived enough for myself. Now, it's time to repay the debt of my community.""","Investigators describe Dr Shaheen Shahid, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset.

‘Abnormal’: Left’s Dipankar Bhattacharya on Bihar poll result; claims ‘three experiments’ aided NDA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abnormal-lefts-dipankar-bhattacharya-on-bihar-poll-result-claims-three-experiments-aided-nda/articleshow/125364532.cms,"CPI (ML) Liberation General Secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya (centre)

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Sunday termed the Bihar assembly election outcome “abnormal,” claiming it was shaped by three “experiments.""According to him, these included the transfer of Rs 10,000 to women under the Mahila Rojgar Yojana, the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, and the transfer of land to a ""corporate house"" at a “throwaway price.”“The poll dates were not announced until all the targeted welfare schemes of the government, including the provision of Rs 10,000 for women, materialised. This is an unprecedented and unique experiment in India’s electoral history,” Bhattacharya told reporters in Patna, two days after the results were declared.The CPI(ML)L, a constituent of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, won just two of the 20 seats it contested — a sharp fall from the 12 out of 19 it secured in 2020. Overall, the three Left parties in the alliance won only three of 33 seats this time, compared to 16 out of 29 in the previous election.Speaking on SIR, Bhattacharya said the deletion of 65 lakh voters and the later addition of 3.5–4 lakh names before the polls had a ""significant impact"" on the result.He added that the third issue — the land transfer — had been raised by the opposition but failed to resonate with the voters, cautioning that it would “normalise the corporatisation of Bihar’s resources.”“From November 18 to 24, our candidates and party workers will go among the people as part of a feedback and public outreach exercise. We need to stop these experiments; otherwise, there will be no level-playing field in politics,” the Left leader stated.The Bihar assembly elections were held on November 6 and 11, covering 121 and 122 constituencies respectively.The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a sweeping victory, winning 202 of the 243 seats. The Mahagathbandhan managed just 35 seats. In 2020, the NDA and the opposition bloc had won 125 and 110 seats respectively.","The Bihar assembly elections were held on November 6 and 11, covering 121 and 122 constituencies.

People of Bihar did not want the jungle raj to return: Jan Suraaj



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party on Sunday claimed that World Bank funds meant for some other project were diverted and transferred to women voters ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections.Jan Suraaj spokesperson Pavan Verma said the scale and timing of the payouts under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana had not only tilted the electoral field but were also sanctioned just an hour before the Model Code of Conduct came into force.He said the party had received information that Rs 14,000 crore out of a total Rs 21,000 crore linked to a World Bank-funded project had been used for this purpose.""The public debt in Bihar is at present 4,06,000 crores. The interest per day is 63 crores. The treasury is empty. We have information which could be wrong, also that the amount of Rs 10,000 given to women in the state was given from Rs 21,000 crores, which came from the World Bank for some other project. An hour before the moral code of conduct for the polls, Rs 14,000 crores were taken out and distributed to 1.25 crore women in the state,"" he claimed in an interview with news agency ANI.Union minister Chirag Paswan dismissed the allegations outright, questioning both the credibility of the data and the intent behind the accusations.""Where do they get this data from, this information from?... Making empty claims - if you have any facts, present it and the Govt will respond,"" the LJP(RV) chief said, as quoted by ANI.Verma further rejected suggestions that Prashant Kishor’s stand on lifting the liquor ban had damaged the party. He argued instead that the prohibition regime was already ineffective, with liquor “being sold at every nook and corner” and even home-delivered at inflated prices. He noted that over two lakh people, mostly from extremely backward Dalit communities, had been jailed under the prohibition law. “People are consuming it and paying more for it. Would that not affect women who have to run their homes?” he asked.Despite mounting a high-energy campaign and contesting all 243 seats, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single constituency. Verma said last-minute cash transfers, women-centric schemes, and a consolidation among voters who did not want the “jungle raaj” of the RJD to return proved decisive. “Nitish ji was the X factor… People of Bihar did not want the jungle raj of Lalu ji, RJD and Tejashwi to return,” he said.The ruling NDA got 202 seats, a three-fourths majority in the 243-member House.

AQI still 'very poor'



NEW DELHI: The national capital shivered through its coldest November night in three years on Sunday, with temperatures dipping to 9°C — 4.5 degrees below the seasonal average according to the India Meteorological Department. Not since 29 November 2022, when the city recorded 7.3°C, has November felt this cold. In the past two years, the lowest November readings were 9.2°C in 2023 and 9.5°C in 2024.The weather office expects the chill to persist, forecasting a minimum of 9°C and a maximum of around 25°C on Monday, along with shallow fog by early morning. Humidity touched 81 per cent at 8.30am on Sunday, adding to the dense smog that blanketed large parts of the city.Even as temperatures plunged, pollution levels remained grim. Delhi’s 24-hour average Air Quality Index stood at 377 on Sunday — firmly in the ‘very poor’ category. At several monitoring stations, conditions were far worse: the CPCB’s Sameer app showed that 11 of 39 sites were in the ‘severe’ bracket with readings above 400. By Sunday morning, 18 stations had slipped into the severe range, while another 20 recorded ‘very poor’ air.Iconic locations such as India Gate, Rajghat and ITO were engulfed in a thick layer of smog, with Rajghat and ITO hitting an alarming AQI of 417. Chandni Chowk touched 420, while Anand Vihar, Alipur and Ashok Vihar hovered between 400 and 415. Even areas with slightly lower levels, such as Dwarka (378) and Dhaula Kuan (338), remained heavily polluted.Authorities said PM2.5 and PM10 particles were the dominant pollutants. With the haze settling deeper as winter begins, the Commission for Air Quality Management has enforced Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan. Measures include a ban on most non-essential construction, restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of classes up to Class 5, curbs on polluting industrial activity and a ban on non-emergency diesel generator sets.","The national capital shivered through its coldest November night in three years on Sunday.

Growing need for anti-drone systems

NEW DELHI: The Army and the Air Force are preparing to place orders for 16 indigenous drone detection and interdiction systems. These systems can hit unmanned aerial vehicles at a distance of 2 km using lasers and disable them.The defence ministry is expected to clear DRDO ’s Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System (Mark 2). Officials told ANI that this version can engage enemy drones with a 10-kilowatt laser at 2 km. The earlier system could target drones only up to around 1 km.DRDO has also test-fired a direct energy weapon system that can target threats at 5 km.

Yatras: A time-honoured tool of Indian politics



Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra



Tejashwi Yadav’s Bihar Adhikar Yatra



Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj padyatra



Structure trumps yatra



In the lead-up to Bihar’s assembly polls, three major marches: Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra, Tejashwi Yadav’s Bihar Adhikar Yatra and Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Padyatra were expected to energise the opposition and reshape the election narrative. All three drew large crowds and garnered a lot of attention.Yet, when the votes were counted, none of these grand yatras translated into electoral gains. The BJP-led NDA romped home with over 202 seats out of 243, consigning Congress and its allies to a crushing defeat. The INDIA bloc’s ambitious marches proved ineffective: Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra did not prove to be a trump card, and its message of “vote theft” remained largely irrelevant in Bihar politics.Likewise, Tejashwi Yadav’s tour failed to expand his party’s base, and Kishor’s two-year-long trek ended without a single Jan Suraaj victory. In short, symbolism could not substitute for organisation in Bihar’s rugged electoral terrain.Pan-India “padayatra” has long been a favourite strategy for politicians seeking to connect with voters. And they are suddenly all the rage in politics, with leaders across parties taking to the road in dramatic, high-octane treks.Rahul Gandhi helped revive the trend with his Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2022–23, walking nearly 4,000km from Kanyakumari to Srinagar, followed by the far longer Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra earlier this year.Hot on his heels came Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai, whose En Mann, En Makkal journey criss-crossed 10,000km and ended with a grand finale attended by the Prime Minister. TDP’s Nara Lokesh completed his own youth-focused Yuva Galam, insisting it was more about listening than winning.Such yatras can energise party cadres and highlight campaign themes. The yatras can be termed as “sanjivani” (life-giving) for parties, refreshing the organisation and giving campaigns a solid foundation.In Bihar, where rural networks and caste ties are crucial, parties often deploy yatras to visit far-flung villages and rural clusters. A well-timed yatra can build momentum by showing unity and giving voters a sense of participation. Yet this year, spectacle without substance was no match for the NDA’s disciplined strategy. Despite the grand fanfare of these three yatras, Bihar’s electorate delivered a very different verdict.Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra (August–September) was hyped as a campaign to protect voter rights. Covering over 1,300 km across 25 districts and more than 100 constituencies, Rahul donned Bihar’s cultural symbols, the gamcha scarf, a cap and attacked alleged “vote chori” (vote stealing) and the state’s Special Intensive Revision of rolls. The march began with impressive crowds, especially in Sasaram, and projected Congress’s return to rural areas.However, from the very start, it was clear that public enthusiasm would not last. In the ensuing weeks, energy fell sharply. The yatra began with strong crowds, but as the campaign moved forward, the initial spark faded. Congress leaned heavily on the yatra’s symbolism but failed to build an effective ground organisation. Outside of a few big rallies, senior Congress leaders were largely absent, and booth-level mobilisation was weak. Rahul’s strategy focused obsessively on national issues like electoral rolls, which did not strike a chord with most Biharis. Ordinary voters were more concerned with jobs, inflation and local governance than allegations of “voter chori.”Rahul’s campaign squandered precious time attacking the Election Commission, and the shift backfired. After rallying around national narratives, Congress’s messaging was drowned out by local realities it failed to read. By election day, Congress only won 6 seats out of 61 contested: a miserable 10% success rate. Rural crowds did not turn into rural votes. Internal alliance tensions didn’t help either: Rahul kept a distance after the Yatra and reappeared only weeks later, and the absence of sustained leadership further undermined Congress.Meanwhile, Bihar’s ruling BJP and JD(U) gleefully declared Rahul’s march a flop show. Their taunts echoed the ground reality: for all its high production values, the Voter Adhikar Yatra failed to translate into votes for Congress, leaving the party facing one of its worst-ever Bihar results. In short, Rahul’s narrative of “vote chori” and his focus on fighting SIR proved largely irrelevant to the Bihar electorate. His Yatra simply did not prove to be a trump card.Tejashwi Yadav’s Bihar Adhikar Yatra was launched on September 16, almost immediately after Rahul’s tour. Setting out from Jehanabad, Tejashwi promised to challenge the Nitish Kumar government on unemployment, crime and local grievances. The yatra was partly pitched as filling gaps left by Rahul’s march; RJD officials openly said they covered districts left out of the Voter Adhikar Yatra. By highlighting issues in RJD strongholds: Jehanabad, Nalanda, Supaul, Saharsa and others. Tejashwi aimed to consolidate his party’s core vote and signal that the RJD was the main force in the INDIA bloc. He also used the trip to assert himself: earlier, he had declared he would contest all 243 seats, underlining his claim to be the alliance’s undisputed leader.In theory, Tejashwi’s focused effort should have solidified his social coalition and countered anti-incumbency. In practice, it barely made a dent outside his base. By election day, the RJD had outperformed Congress, but only marginally: the party was on course for about 25 seats, far below its 75 in 2020.Tejashwi failed to convert the momentum and anti-incumbency wave against Nitish Kumar into actual votes, leaving the RJD with its second-worst tally ever. The much-heralded yatra vision of reaching every village did little to overcome the RJD’s narrow caste profile. Most communities beyond the Muslim–Yadav base remained unconvinced, and even within the RJD, ticket distribution caused resentment. Seat-sharing disputes led to friendly fights where opposition partners split the anti-NDA vote.In the end, Tejashwi’s personal crusade could not overcome these structural flaws. The RJD held on to pockets of support but did not expand beyond its traditional base. The youth-versus-experience narrative he touted collapsed under the weight of Nitish Kumar’s intact governance credentials and the shadows of the ""jungle raj.""Prashant Kishor entered the fray with arguably the grandest walking tour of all: a 3,500 km Jan Suraaj Padyatra launched on Gandhi Jayanti 2023. A celebrated poll strategist-turned-aspirant, Kishor promised a people’s movement – reaching every panchayat, listening to voters, and forging a vision document on education, health and agriculture. For months, he walked through remote Bihar, courting media attention and projecting himself as an alternative to both the NDA and the Grand Alliance.Yet on November 14, the results laid bare the folly of that endeavour. The Jan Suraaj Party failed to register a single electoral win. Most of its candidates forfeited their deposits, signalling minimal vote share. Kishor entered the Bihar polls as a political aspirant and walked out as its biggest loser. Despite all the media hype, his technocratic, governance-centric message did not resonate in a polarised contest dominated by clear caste and welfare narratives. Voters showed little appetite for this new kind of politics.Kishor had gambled that his nationwide profile and long trek would translate to votes; instead, it highlighted the disconnect. The Jan Suraaj experiment demonstrated that mere visibility cannot replace grassroots machinery. His late decision to withdraw candidates from certain constituencies only reinforced perceptions of organisational chaos.While the three opposition yatras floundered, the NDA executed a far more disciplined and targeted campaign. The alliance maintained unity and clear messaging throughout. The BJP ceded certain seats to allies to consolidate OBC and Dalit votes. Caste calculations paid off, and the coalition’s welfare-focused agenda resonated strongly. Record female turnout over 71% tilted the mandate towards the NDA, driven by schemes such as women’s entrepreneurship subsidies.The NDA ran on a combination of Nitish Kumar’s governance brand and BJP’s organisational muscle. Nitish (JD(U)) carried the narrative weight, focusing on law-and-order and welfare. He unleashed a series of high-profile welfare schemes for women, the elderly and the poor: for example, a deposit of Rs 10,000 in women’s accounts, free electricity up to 125 units, and higher pensionsIn contrast, the Mahagathbandhan’s strategy was messy. Seat-sharing remained an open wound: even on the eve of polling, allies had not finalised allocations, leading to several cases where partners fielded candidates against each other. This confusion squandered whatever goodwill Rahul’s Yatra had generated. The INDIA bloc lacked a coherent narrative. Issues like the Special Intensive Revision failed to galvanise voters, whereas the NDA’s focus on good governance and economic benefits rang true at the booth level. The opposition entered the polls divided, with disputes and no unified strategy, while the NDA’s welfare-focused messaging proved far stronger.Grand marches can generate excitement, but in Bihar, they cannot substitute for solid organisation and clear leadership. Rahul Gandhi’s 1,300-km yatra dazzled onlookers but saw Congress’s vote share collapse to one of its lowest levels. Tejashwi Yadav’s bid for prominence reinforced the RJD’s base but did not expand it. And Prashant Kishor’s sprawling padyatra proved that even two years of walking cannot conjure an instant vote ban","Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra did not prove to be a trump card, and its message of “vote theft’ remained largely irrelevant in Bihar politics.

Mahe-Class: Navy to commission its first indigenous shallow water anti-submarine warfare vessel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahe-class-navy-to-commission-its-first-indigenous-shallow-water-anti-submarine-warfare-vessel/articleshow/125364302.cms,"CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

The Indian Navy is set to achieve a new milestone in its drive toward self-reliance with the commissioning of INS Mahe, the first of the Mahe-class Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Crafts (ASW-SWCs). The vessel will be officially inducted at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai on November 24, marking a significant step forward in India’s indigenous shipbuilding capabilities.Built by Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL), Kochi, INS Mahe is a key symbol of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, reflecting the Navy’s sustained push for homegrown defence technologies. Designed and constructed entirely in India, the vessel demonstrates the nation’s growing expertise in modern naval architecture, combat systems, and platform integration.Compact yet formidable, Mahe blends agility, endurance, and cutting-edge technology—qualities essential for operations in shallow waters and coastal zones. Equipped with advanced sonar, radar, and weapons systems, the ship is designed for anti-submarine warfare, coastal patrols, underwater surveillance, low-intensity maritime operations (LIMO), and mine-laying missions. Its primary role will be to safeguard India’s critical maritime approaches and counter underwater threats in littoral regions.According to the Ministry of Defence, Mahe was delivered to the Indian Navy on October 23, 2025, ahead of its commissioning. At approximately 78 metres in length and displacing around 1,100 tons, the platform integrates torpedo systems and multifunctional anti-submarine rockets, giving it significant capability for underwater combat and area denial.With over 80 percent indigenous content, the Mahe-class ships represent a major leap in India’s quest for self-reliance in naval ship design and production. The vessel’s crest features the Urumi—the flexible sword of Kalarippayattu—symbolizing the same agility, precision, and lethal grace that define the ship’s operational character.Named after the historic coastal town of Mahe on the Malabar Coast, INS Mahe heralds the arrival of a new generation of Indian-built shallow-water combatants—sleek, swift, and resolutely Indian. Seven more ships of this class will follow, further bolstering the Navy’s capabilities in coastal defence and anti-submarine warfare.","The Indian Navy is set to achieve a new milestone in its drive toward self- reliance with the commissioning of INS Mahe.

Access to call details





BENGALURU: A senior executi ve, 57, at an MNC lost Rs 31.8 crore to a digital arrest scam after months of relentless coercion by a cybercrime syndicate. The gang monitored her over video calls — even during hospitalisation — and threatened that any misstep would lead to her arrest and put her family at risk.Her ordeal began on Sept 15, 2024. She received a call from a man claiming to be from DHL Logistics in Andheri, Mumbai. He alleged that a parcel in her name contained three credit cards, four passports, and MDMA. Shocked, she replied that she lived in Bengaluru and had never been to Mumbai, making it impossible for her to have booked the parcel.The caller insisted that her personal documents, mobile number, and address were used in the booking and advised her to report the issue to the cybercrime cell. Before she could react, the call was transferred to another line where callers posed as Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials. “It was a horrifying experience. They said it didn’t matter if I was there or not. Since my identity was used, I’m responsible, and all evidence was against me,” she stated in her police complaint.The fraudsters instructed her not to contact local police or lawyers, claiming this would put her security at risk because dangerous criminals who had misused her identity were supposedly monitoring her home.They warned her not to share anything with her family, saying that would imply her family was also involved.Fearing for her son’s upcoming wedding, she agreed to comply. She was told to communicate only through the Skype IDs provided by the gang. A man identifying himself as Mohit Handa claimed to be a CID officer. He ordered her to keep her camera switched on at all times as she was under “house arrest”. For two days, he monitored her continuously.Later, she was passed on to another fraudster impersonating CBI officer Pradeep Singh. He allegedly shouted at her and pretended to arrest Handa for taking a bribe — part of a staged drama to convince her the investigation was genuine. Another caller, named Rahul Yadav, monitored her movements for a week while she worked from home.On Sept 23, 2024, Singh contacted her via video call and directed her to move to a hotel. The callers seemed to know every incoming call she received and her location. They told her that the way to prove her innocence was by verifying her assets with the RBI’s Financial Intelligence Unit. They displayed what looked like official letters from the RBI’s cybercrime department and demanded a list of her assets.The crooks also appeared to have access to her tax filings, which led her to believe them. They told her that 90% of her funds had to be deposited as a “surety” to clear her name. The letter she received was signed by a person posing as cybercrime official Nitin Patel.Between Sept 24 and Oct 22, 2024, she shared complete details of her finances. She was then instructed to transfer Rs 2 crore initially. Between Oct 24 and Nov 3, she made the transfers. She was told she would receive the clearance letter by Dec 1, which was important for her as her son’s engagement was scheduled on Dec 6.Through daily threats and monitoring of her devices, the pressure continued. When she was asked to pay another Rs 2.4 crore as tax, she complied. A clearance letter arrived on Dec 1, 2024, and the engagement took place as planned. Soon after, she fell ill and required hospitalisation. She was still compelled to report daily updates over Skype. Singh assured her the money would be returned by Feb 25, 2025. But instead, more “processing charges” were demanded.After March 26, the crooks vanished. “I was in shock, it took months for me to recover. My son got married in June 2025, and I waited for it to be over. Through 187 transactions, I stand deprived of approximately Rs 31.8 crore,” said her complaint.","A senior executi ve, 57, at an MNC lost Rs 31.8 crore to a digital arrest scam.

Inside H-1B row: How Trump’s sudden U-turns could leave America losing the talent war to foreigners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/inside-h-1b-row-how-trumps-sudden-u-turns-could-leave-america-losing-the-talent-war-to-foreigners/articleshow/125333580.cms,"'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

What are H1-B visas and who uses them



How are American jobs at risk



Supporters say the programme keeps America competitive



MAGA does not like Trump's U-turn







A heated national row over jobs, immigration and the future of the American workforce has intensified after President Donald Trump suggested that the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” earlier this week, even as the Trump Administation tightens rules around the H1-B visa programme.The GOP leader's latest comments have reignited a long-running political fight over whether foreign workers are helping American innovation or displacing American workers.The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years. It is intended for people of “exceptional merit and ability”, typically with at least a bachelor’s degree. The tech sector remains the biggest user of the programme, accounting for up to 70 percent of applications each year. Engineering, consulting, healthcare and university research also rely heavily on the visa.India dominates the applicant pool, making up 73 per cent of all H1-B visa holders, followed by China at 12 per cent, according to Fox News. Universities and non-profit research institutions are exempt from the usual annual cap of 65,000 visas, plus an additional 20,000 for applicants with advanced degrees, which means the total number of approvals is often far higher.Pew Research Center estimates around 400,000 approvals in the last year alone.Opposition to the programme spans both Republicans and Democrats. Critics argue that the system is being abused to import cheaper labour and push aside American workers.In September, Trump issued a presidential proclamation accusing the H1-B system of being “deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”. He said this practice “has undermined both our economic and national security”.Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on each new H1-B visa application, effective September 21. His administration is also introducing stricter definitions of “specialty occupation”, expanding compliance inspections, and requiring employers to file applications directly rather than through third-party contractors.Many business leaders warn that harsh restrictions could push talent and investment overseas. The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit to block the new $100,000 fee, arguing it violates immigration law and would make the programme “cost-prohibitive” for small and mid-size companies.Elon Musk is among the most vocal defenders of the visa system, noting that many of the engineers who helped build Tesla and SpaceX first arrived in the United States on H1-B visas. He said, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.”Despite his own sweeping restrictions, Trump stirred a row this week by insisting that the United States still needed foreign workers because “people have to learn”. He added that “the United States doesn’t have certain talents” and warned that some highly technical defence and technology roles cannot simply be filled by “taking people off an unemployment line”.His remarks have frustrated parts of his MAGA base, who view the comment as undercutting his America First message. Others argue it reveals the core tension at the centre of the H1-B debate: the nation wants to protect American jobs, but it also fears falling behind global competitors like China, which recently launched its own talent visa known as the K visa.","The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries. As Vance spoke to Sean Hannity, he said the Democrat model was to import more low-wage immigrants which he said hurt the jobs, wages and prosperity.Vance said the choice is between low-wage immigrants and American citizens empowered by technology. The VP said Trump's model is the second one which will pave prosperity for America.As Vance said US should avoid relying on low-wage workers and instead focus on using technology to empower the blue-collar workers, he struck a different chord with the President. Because the president said America lacks certain types of talent and cited the example of the battery plant in Georgia that was raided.“They raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out. They had people from South Korea that made batteries all their lives. You know, making batteries are very complicated. It’s not an easy thing and very dangerous,"" Trump said adding that the South Korean company had “like five or six hundred people, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it.Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. ""You're going to need that,"" Trump said when he was asked whether H-1B visa will be a big priority for his administration.H-1B visa program is for high-skilled individuals, mostly employed in tech and education sectors. But while Trump said US needs foreign workers, Vance said US does not need low-wage foreign workers.“Their (the Democrats) idea was the way that we get more prosperity is that you import more and more low-wage servants and that actually I think reduced prosperity, because it meant that a lot of our blue-collar workers were struggling. But if you use technology and you empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor, I think they are going to do way better, they are going to make higher wages and the whole country is going to be better off,"" Vance said.""In other words, do you depend on low-wage immigrants or do you depend on American citizens bolstered by technology and innovation? That’s the Trump model,"" Vance added.","Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi





Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers. In partnership with the electrical training ALLIANCE, the company will help train existing electricians and more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, more than doubling the state’s expected pipeline of new electricians.Google said the investment is meant not only to bolster Texas’ workforce and infrastructure, but to help ensure the U.S. maintains “the technical backbone to lead the world in AI.”","Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella quotes Bill Gates to explain what makes a true AI platform; Elon Musk responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-quotes-bill-gates-to-explain-what-makes-a-true-ai-platform-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/125362427.cms,"

Nadella says Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI is an example of zero-sum mindset industry





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently shared a post explaining what he believes defines a real artificial intelligence (AI) platform — and he turned to a well-known idea from Bill Gates to make his point. In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), Nadella said tech companies should focus on building AI systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them, not just for the companies that make the technology. He cited Bill Gates to emphasize the same: “A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to Nadella's post with a facepalm emoji.Nadella said this idea matters even more during the current AI boom, where many firms risk giving away too much of their own value to big tech platforms. “The real question is how to empower every company out there to build their own AI-native capabilities,” he wrote.Nadella pointed to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI as an example of how a “positive-sum” approach can work. “Our investment helped them scale; their research accelerated our own innovation,” he said, adding that both companies benefited by improving each other’s products and infrastructure.Nadella also highlighted the companies involved in building Microsoft’s new AI infrastructure. He said the world’s first “AI superfactory” — recently announced by Microsoft and OpenAI — was developed using learnings from three generations of AI supercomputers and through close collaboration with Nvidia.He added that Microsoft has now integrated AMD chips as well, giving startups and enterprises more options for training and running their AI models.The Microsoft CEO said the real test of the AI era will not be tech valuations but whether industries like healthcare, manufacturing, education and agriculture see real-world gains. “When a pharma company uses AI to bring a new therapy to market in one year instead of twelve… that’s when we’ll know the system is working,” he said.He urged companies to avoid “zero-sum thinking” and warned them to protect their own data and value instead of relying solely on partnerships that may turn “extractive” over time.Nadella concluded by saying the industry has an opportunity to ensure AI benefits are widely spread — a lesson, he noted, that comes from past waves of technology where some sectors, like local media, were left behind.",Satya Nadella says tech companies should focus on building AI systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them.

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Competing with SpaceX's dominance









Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing its massive New Glenn rocket booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting congratulations from rival SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . The successful landing marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race, making Blue Origin only the second company after SpaceX to master the complex technology of landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse.“Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!"" Musk wrote on social media in a response to Blue Origin’s announcement.In a separate post, Musk replied to a post shared by Jeff Bezos who shared a video clip of the New Glenn rocket booster landing in the middle of a platform floating in the ocean.The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST. The landing followed the successful deployment of NASA's twin ESCAPADE satellites on a mission to study Mars’s atmospheric loss and solar wind interactions.“We achieved full mission success today, and I am so proud of the team. Never before in history has a booster this large nailed the landing on the second try. This is just the beginning as we rapidly scale our flight cadence and continue delivering for our customers,” said Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO.The achievement represents a significant breakthrough in Blue Origin's efforts to compete with SpaceX, which has long dominated the reusable rocket market with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Reusability reduces launch costs by allowing expensive first-stage boosters to be recovered, refurbished, and flown multiple times rather than discarded after a single use.Blue Origin’s New Glenn is designed for up to 25 reuses, promising to bring competitive pricing and reliability to deep space and orbital missions. The company has already secured multiple years of orders from customers including NASA, Amazon's Project Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile, and several telecommunications providers.","The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default. He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has declared that the next decade represents a period of immense historical consequence, arguing that the coming 10 years will have a greater determination over the next 100 years than any prior era due to the arrival of non-human intelligence, or artificial intelligence (AI). Schmidt compared the emergence of AI to fundamental inventions in human history, such as electricity or the invention of fire, stressing its revolutionary power.“We are fortunate to be living in a time of great historical consequence,” Schmidt said in a virtual interview recently. He emphasised that the new AI tools are very powerful because they can “equal and, in some cases, surpass human intelligence,"" which is the source of societal growth and innovation.""The countries and companies that embrace this non-human intelligence correctly and aggressively will be the big winners,"" Schmidt stated.Conversely, he warned that companies and countries that slow their adoption or allow others to lead will fall behind, as economic growth and leadership are derived from the application of intelligence to solve new problems.“And the companies and countries that slow or let other people do it, they will lose because the source of excellence, the source of leadership, the source of growth, the source of everything, the source of innovation…everything..ofeconomic growth comes from the application of intelligence to discover new things to solve new problems,” he said.Schmidt also sounded a major geopolitical alarm, naming the potential global dominance of Chinese open-source AI models as one of his “biggest fears” for the future of the technology.Speaking on the Moonshots podcast this week, Schmidt highlighted a growing divergence in the global AI landscape:US Models: Primarily closed-source and costly.Chinese Models: Largely open-source and free.“The geopolitical issue there, of course, is that open source is free and the closed source models are not free,” Schmidt explained.","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns of Chinese open-source dominance of AI.

The Labour Commissioner office in Pune has summoned Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in matters filed by the IT industry employees union, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). In its complaint, NITES alleged unlawful terminations and layoffs by TCS. NITES shared the same in a post on microblogging website, Twitter.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’



""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIl' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. Search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey, gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIl' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

Operation Castle Bay: 6 foreign poachers caught after week-long jungle hunt in Andaman and Nicobar island,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/operation-castle-bay-6-foreign-poachers-caught-after-week-long-jungle-hunt-in-andaman-and-nicobar-island/articleshow/125375964.cms,"A week-long, gruelling joint operation in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands led to the arrest of six foreign poachers





NEW DELHI: Six foreign poachers were apprehended following a gruelling week-long joint anti-poaching operation in the remote and treacherous terrain of Look-out-Post (LoP) Tillongchoung.The breakthrough, under Operation ""Castle Bay,"" was the result of seamless coordination between the Andaman and Nicobar Police (including IRBn personnel) and units from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.The operation began after a Coast Guard Dornier aircraft spotted an abandoned foreign boat on November 8. It was marked by relentless ground efforts through dense jungles and extreme conditions.According to DCP (A&N) HGS Dhaliwal, the abandoned foreign boat carrying a large quantity of sea cucumber was spotted on the eastern side of Tillang Chong while our LoP is located on the western side. ""The main challenge was executing the operation through difficult terrain, especially after sunset,"" he said.Officials confirmed that the poachers, who are reportedly Myanmarese nationals, were arrested on November 15 after being tracked from a remote jungle location.The teams, which also pressed drones into action, demonstrated exceptional synergy to safeguard the archipelago, reiterating a zero-tolerance policy for poaching.""This decisive action is a testament to the commitment of our forces in protecting the fragile ecosystem and securing our maritime boundaries,"" Dhaliwal said. ""The operation continues with full commitment to ensure the complete neutralisation of any remaining threats,"" he added.Tillangchong is an uninhabited island in the Nicobar district of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, notable for its thick vegetation, a 24-metre lighthouse, and its status as a sanctuary. The island is in the Nicobar Islands group, located in the Bay of Bengal, making it the easternmost island in the Nicobar group.While the apprehension of poachers here is a significant victory, it underscores the persistent and profound dangers posed by illegal activities to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' unique biodiversity. The archipelago, a global biodiversity hotspot, is continually targeted by foreign poaching syndicates, primarily from neighbouring countries, who exploit its rich but vulnerable marine and forest resources.The most frequently targeted species are sea cucumbers, highly valued in Southeast Asian markets for use in exotic cuisine and traditional medicine. These creatures are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, placing them in the same category as tigers. Their removal is devastating, as sea cucumbers act as natural cleaners of the seabed, recycling nutrients essential for maintaining the health of coral reefs and seagrass meadows.Poaching is not limited to marine life. Terrestrial animals like spotted deer and wild pigs are hunted for meat, while sea turtles and their eggs are illegally sought after, further destabilising the delicate food chain. Trespassing and poaching also pose a direct threat to the isolated indigenous tribes of the Andamans, such as the Jarawas, by depleting their traditional resources and increasing the risk of introducing diseases.The islands' vast, scattered geography—comprising over 500 landmasses and extensive coastlines—makes constant, comprehensive surveillance a logistical challenge. Poachers exploit these gaps, often sneaking into Indian territorial waters under the cover of darkness.The successful joint operation at Tillongchoung, which required coordinated action across all branches of the armed forces and police, highlights the scale of effort required to combat this organised environmental crime. Statistics from the A&N Police show a continuing trend of arrests, with dozens of Myanmarese poachers apprehended each year. In September, A&N police arrested 14 poachers.","A week-long, gruelling joint operation in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands led to the arrest of six foreign poachers.

Quick-commerce boom: Swiggy to expand use cases for Bolt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/quick-commerce-boom-swiggy-to-expand-use-cases-for-bolt/articleshow/125375766.cms,"Representative image





MUMBAI: Blame it on quick commerce that’s made Indians used to getting groceries and a host of other products including make-up, light jewellery items and occasionally even iPhones in 10 minutes, consumers now want their food to get delivered faster unless it’s a gourmet recipe or something they want to have at leisure.They would preferably want their cup of coffee, an ice-cream or say a quick breakfast meal during the rush morning hours in minutes if they are given a choice, said Rohit Kapoor, CEO, food marketplace at Swiggy, for which its quick (food) delivery offering Bolt has been recording a double-digit growth, notching up higher repeat users.“The impact of quick commerce is not just there on food delivery but it’s rubbing off on everything. Quick commerce made consumers aware of the fact that they love speed. We realised there is an entry point here where consumers are looking for faster deliveries....our data showed that and we built that (Bolt),” Kapoor told TOI.Bolt, Swiggy’s 10-minute food offering, already contributes over one in 10 orders to the platform. The company, which competes with Eternal (formerly Zomato) in both food delivery and quick commerce spaces, now plans to expand use cases under Bolt, said Kapoor.The opportunity, for instance, lies in tapping into evening snacks and late-night meals which are often driven by hunger pangs, at times craving for certain food items and people wouldn’t want to wait.The food delivery market in India is largely a duopoly between listed players Swiggy and Eternal. Swiggy also operates in the quick commerce space through Instamart, where it rivals Eternal’s Blinkit, Zepto and smaller players--Tata’s BigBasket, Flipkart Minutes and Amazon Now.In the food delivery space, the growth strategy will be to get new users rather than launching in new cities, said Kapoor. “The market will not grow when you keep focusing on the same set of consumers. There is a job cut out in terms of going to the next set of consumers who are looking at food delivery or food in a different way,” Kapoor said.And there’s enough scope—there's the younger lot who are growing up in a “convenience economy” and with consumers becoming discerning, eating habits are undergoing a change, companies can widen their play by tapping into new demand spaces. Swiggy today, for instance, offers high protein food as a separate offering within the app; it has also launched DeskEats targeted at professionals looking for easy meal options at work. Students and early jobbers would be the consumer cohorts it will focus on going ahead, said Kapoor. “We are responding to consumers in multiple, different ways. I don’t think food delivery as a singular model will exist,” said Kapoor.Swiggy, which has posted wider losses in Q2 on the back of investments in quick commerce business, has been hiking delivery fees for food. “For a platform to continue to do well, it must be healthy. Financial profitability is a way of staying healthy and that ability comes from the right way of monetisation happening,” said Kapoor. The food delivery business recorded an adjusted EBITDA of Rs 240 crore in Q2.","Swiggy’s 10-minute food offering, Bolt, already contributes over one in 10 orders to the platform.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Crude prices edge lower as Russia restarts exports





Asian markets started the week on a weak note, with investors turning cautious amid fading expectations of a US rate cut and rising concerns over stretched tech valuations.The uncertain mood also spilled over into cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin briefly dipping below its end-2023 level.As per news agency AFP, traders are increasingly doubtful the Federal Reserve will cut rates next month after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that another reduction was “not certain”, while other policymakers have also suggested they may pause.Inflation staying above the Fed’s 2% target has added to those nerves. Markets are now waiting for delayed US jobs and inflation data, held up by the record government shutdown.A fragile lead from Wall Street meant most Asian bourses slipped. Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney and Singapore were lower, while Seoul, Manila and Taipei managed gains, according to AFP.Tokyo also fell after data showed Japan’s economy contracted 0.4% in the September quarter. Tourism and retail firms were hit hard after China advised its citizens against travelling to Japan following a diplomatic row over remarks by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about Taiwan.As per AFP, Shiseido sank 9%, Takashimaya more than 5%, and Fast Retailing over 4%.In Australia, the ASX slipped to a four-month low after BHP dropped 0.7% following a British court ruling over a Brazilian dam collapse.Across markets, attention remains fixed on Nvidia’s earnings this week. The chipmaker, which became the first company to cross a $5 trillion valuation this month, has been central to the AI-fuelled surge. Concerns are rising about a possible bubble.Fiona Cincotta of City Index warned that investors are questioning “the amount of money companies are spending on the tech relative to the returns”.Expectations for a December US rate cut have dropped from over 60% last week to around 40%. US 10-year Treasury yields held at 4.156% in Tokyo. The delayed US jobs report arrives Thursday, though Reuters noted it may be “too stale” to shift market thinking.Bitcoin also weakened, with a fall to $92,935 — below its end-December finish — after climbing earlier this year on optimism linked to Donald Trump’s return to the White House.Oil prices slipped in early Asian trade on Monday after Russia resumed loadings at the key Novorossiysk export terminal following a two-day shutdown caused by a Ukrainian attack, reported Reuters.Brent crude fell 0.9% to $63.81 a barrel, while US WTI dropped 1% to $59.50.Both benchmarks had risen more than 2% on Friday after exports were halted at Novorossiysk and a nearby Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal, collectively disrupting around 2% of global supply.While shipments have restarted, Ukraine’s continued strikes on Russian refineries — including Ryazan and Novokuibyshevsk — have kept the market on alert.Analyst Toshitaka Tazawa of Fujitomi Securities was quoted as saying by Reuters that traders are weighing the long-term risks to Russia’s exports while also taking profits after Friday’s rally.He added that expectations of oversupply from OPEC+ production increases remain, with WTI likely to hover around $60 within a $5 band.As per Reuters, Western sanctions remain a key watchpoint, with the US banning dealings with Russian oil firms Lukoil and Rosneft after November 21. President Donald Trump said Republicans are preparing legislation to penalise any country trading with Russia, adding that Iran could be included.Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to increase December output targets by 137,000 barrels per day and to pause further hikes in the first quarter of next year.Meanwhile, US drillers added three oil rigs last week, bringing the total to 417.","Asian markets start the week on a weak note, with investors turning cautious amid fading expectations of a US rate cut.

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as'very poor' Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125375374,imgsize-15722,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/a-thick-layer-of-smog-continued-to-blanket-delhi-on-monday-showing-little-improvement-from-sundays-aqi-of-385.jpg"

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels





NEW DELHI: The first fortnight of this Nov had the lowest average air quality index (AQI) in three years, though it was still in the very poor category.An early Diwali, low contribution of stubble burning, relatively better meteorological conditions and sprinkling of water around monitoring stations kept the average AQI at 348 this Nov 1 to 15. It was 367 during the same period last year, 376 in 2023 and 345 in 2022.TOI earlier reported that this is typically the most polluted period in Delhi, with an average AQI of 371, citing an analysis conducted by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) from 2018 to 2023. It often coincides with peak stubble burning, increased traffic because of festivals and unfavourable meteorological conditions.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said, ""We can't trust AQI readings this year because of recorded instances of water being sprinkled near monitoring stations, which suppress the index figures. Obstructions near the stations are also resulting in distorted readings. A relatively late spike in farm fires may also have been a key factor.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows there were three severe air days (AQI above 400 on a scale of 500), 10 very poor days and two poor days this Nov 1 to 15. Last year, during the same period, there were two severe and 13 very poor days.The city is likely to record another spell of severe AQI from Monday to Wednesday, according to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS), which functions under Union ministry of earth sciences.The air quality may be either severe or very poor in the next six days.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB's air laboratory, said, ""Higher wind speed compared to previous years has played an important role in dispersion of emissions this month. The air quality will further improve if the wind picks up even more.""According to an analysis by Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Delhi's second-most polluted fortnight of the year is Dec 15 to 31, with an average AQI of 354.During this period, though stubble burning has no roleto play, dense-fog episodes and increased vehicular movement due to festivals and weddings worsen the air.The third-most polluted stretch is Jan 1 to 15, with an average AQI of 324.","First fortnight of Nov had lowest average air quality index (AQI) in three years.

Net profits have grown by 10.8%, which is the best in the last six quarters. This is a beat over earlier estimates. The present trends in consumption indicate that earnings will further improve in Q3. Discretionary consumption, particularly automobiles, will lead earnings growth in Q3. Whether the present boom in consumption will continue even after the festival season is to be watched.”“A sustained uptrend in the market and new record highs have not been happening since FIIs continued selling on all rallies.A change in FII strategy is necessary for the market to break into new record highs and remain there. This, in turn, requires steady improvement in earnings growth, which is likely from Q3 onwards. If the global AI trade loses steam, that would be a helpful factor.”Wall Street concluded the week with varied results on Friday, as investors remained cautious before Nvidia's upcoming quarterly results and showed growing concern about potential delays in the Federal Reserve's December interest-rate reduction.Asian markets began cautiously this week as investors anticipated numerous US economic reports while uncertainty persists regarding the Federal Reserve's policy direction.Gold prices edged higher on Monday whilst investors await multiple US economic reports this week, which could provide additional insights into the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 4,968 crore net on Friday.

Red Sea Global: Driving regenerative development









Saudi Arabia is set to redefine luxury, wellness, and economic impact with the opening of AMAALA Triple Bay. Developed by Red Sea Global, the ultra-luxury coastal destination on the Red Sea is projected to create 50,000 jobs and inject USD 3 billion into the nation’s GDP, marking a landmark step in the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 transformation. Beyond its economic significance, AMAALA promises an unparalleled fusion of regenerative tourism, wellness experiences, and world-class hospitality.AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea. The destination offers a new approach to coastal luxury, with a focus on wellness, rejuvenation, and connection to nature. Its guiding principle is simple: to help guests and residents “live longer, better,” whether through tranquil retreats or adventure-filled experiences along the sun-drenched coastline.John Pagano, Group CEO of Red Sea Global, underscores the ambition: AMAALA is envisioned as the new home of wellness, drawing inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s long-standing traditions of retreat and renewal. The destination is designed to balance high-end luxury with environmental and cultural stewardship.AMAALA’s launch will introduce six world-class resorts, alongside a yacht club, marine life institute, state-of-the-art marina, and a Marina Village. A 5km linear park, the Wellness Route, will connect the resorts and experiences, allowing visitors to traverse pristine natural surroundings seamlessly.Additional first-phase attractions include Corallium, a three-level marine life institute highlighting the Red Sea’s biodiversity, and the AMAALA Hotel, offering 144 keys and multiple dining options for staff and guests alike.AMAALA is integral to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. Red Sea Global anticipates the project will create 50,000 jobs and contribute SAR 11 billion (USD 3 billion) to the national GDP upon completion. Phase One alone involved an investment of SAR 51.04 billion, encompassing nine resorts and over 1,600 keys. Future openings include the Clinique La Prairie Health Resort, Jayasom Wellness Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Resort.The destination also promotes sustainable development at a global scale.

"'Forced labor, withholding visa documents': H-1B visa holder from India sues US company; 'Squid Game for Indians'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/forced-labor-withholding-visa-documents-h-1b-visa-holder-from-india-sues-us-company-squid-game-for-indians/articleshow/125254569.cms,"An H-1B visa holder from India has sued his US company, led by an Indian-origin CEO, for forced labor.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family. Because of the broken promises and inconsistent pay, his health insurance lapsed, he missed credit card payments, and he and his wife lacked access to needed healthcare. At one point, AV suffered a serious leg injury, but he couldn’t see a doctor,"" the lawsuit said.The company extracted a huge amount of money from AV, forcing him to pay all the visa fees and keeping him on the hook. The report said Vallabhaneni is still working with the company as he waits for the Green Card.","Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents.

"US shutdown: Record deadlock ends, but new Republican law set to strip millions from SNAP benefits",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-record-deadlock-ends-but-new-republican-law-set-to-strip-millions-from-snap-benefits/articleshow/125360278.cms,"U.S Shutdown Twist: Inside Capitol Hill’s 36-Hour Sprint to Reopen America; All Eyes On House Dems





Millions of Americans greeted the end of the record-setting 43-day government shutdown and the resumption of food stamp benefits with relief, but others are learning they could soon lose federal food aid permanently under a new Republican tax and spending law.Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins directed USDA staff during the shutdown to press states towards compliance with the law, which is projected to remove millions from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the coming months, Politico reported.These changes, combined with other provisions, represent the most significant cuts to the social safety net in decades and come as low-income families face stagnating wages that are failing to keep pace with soaring living costs—an issue some Republicans blamed for their losses in off-year elections this month.The SNAP programme provides an average of $6 per day for nearly 42 million people, roughly 40 percent of whom are children. Under the new law, parents and older Americans will be subject to stricter work requirements, and states will eventually share in the cost of benefits, a change that could force further cuts, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Tens of thousands of legal immigrants will also lose access to the programme.The loss of SNAP “was really stark during the shutdown,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “But [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] is the largest cut in the programme’s history. That is also going to be really deeply felt.”States have begun notifying participants that they will face tighter work requirements, setting up a three-month countdown to comply or lose benefits entirely. Some states, such as New York and California, hold waivers that lift work requirements in areas with high unemployment rates, which are expected to slow the full impact. Yet certain lawfully present immigrants, including refugees, have been told they are immediately ineligible for SNAP.“While we are concerned about any person in this country going hungry needlessly, there is something spectacularly cruel about ripping out the safety net of people who came to this country who need just a little bit of time to get back on their feet and to begin to be able to contribute economically to this country,” said Naomi Steinberg, vice president of policy and advocacy at HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that assists refugees and asylum seekers.HIAS estimates that the SNAP changes will cut benefits for roughly 250,000 refugees and other humanitarian visa holders.Rollins has indicated that she may press for current SNAP participants to reapply, despite existing certification requirements for income and other eligibility factors. The new plan could add red tape that makes it more difficult to obtain benefits.USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service issued new guidance in October and November during the shutdown on how to comply with tightened work requirements and other changes in the law, but some states are still struggling to interpret it. In California, where more than 5 million people use SNAP, California Department of Social Services Director Jennifer Troia said in a recent webinar, “This is a priority for us. We will move toward compliance with FNS guidance, while also balancing the need for accuracy and clarity. ”Millions of low-income families will also lose access to Medicaid in the next few years when stricter work requirements and other changes for that programme take effect. The Republican tax and spending law has made certain legal immigrants, including refugees, ineligible for Affordable Care Act subsidies. The Trump administration is also developing a new public charge regulation that could deter millions of lawfully present immigrants from using federal safety net programmes.As low-income people struggle to pay utility bills and rent, many rely on the charitable food network. Food banks and pantries are still scrambling to recover from nearly Rs 8,300 crore in federal funding cuts earlier this year and from the chaos caused by the pause in SNAP benefits during the shutdown.During the week of Oct. 27, food banks purchased 325 percent more food through Feeding America’s Grocery Purchase Program than in the same period last year, according to the nonprofit.“It could not be worse,” said Matt Jozwiak, who runs Rethink Food, a charity meal organisation in New York City. “This is just like what’s to come. This is bad, but [OBBA is] permanent.”With hundreds of thousands of refugees and other immigrants facing SNAP cuts, some refugee resettlement organisations are offering emergency food options. “We have a truck, we have a warehouse, and it made sense,” said Laura Thompson Osuri, executive director of Homes Not Borders, a Washington-area nonprofit that assists newly arriving refugees. Her group estimates the OBBA changes will affect roughly 20,000 refugees in the Washington area.Still, private-sector and nonprofit contributions will not suffice when SNAP changes take full effect. According to Feeding America, SNAP provides nine meals for every one provided by food banks.“When I wrote my budget last year for this year, I sure didn’t put this crisis in it,” said Cyndi Kirkhart, who runs Facing Hunger Food Bank in West Virginia, referencing November’s benefits lapse. “Now, I’m going to anticipate there’s going to be more crises, and I’ll just have to budget more and hope that the same kinds of help and support line up. But at some point, everyone is affected by crises. So at what point do folks go, ‘I can’t do any more,’ right?”","A new Republican tax and spending law is projected to remove millions from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) The programme provides an average of $6 per day for nearly 42 million people, roughly 40 percent of whom are children.

Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Another crisis brewing? Pakistan on brink of food supply collapse as flour shortage deepens; prices hit the roof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/another-crisis-brewing-pakistan-on-brink-of-food-supply-collapse-as-flour-shortage-deepens-prices-hit-the-roof/articleshow/125183013.cms,"Pakistan Cries Foul At UNSC As India Holds Indus Waters Treaty In Abeyance Over Pahalgam Attack

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.
