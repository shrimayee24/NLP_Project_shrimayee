LIVE: Trump FIRES At Europe, India, China; Announces SHOCK Reciprocal Tariffs On 'Liberation Day'

United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Prime Minister Modi his 'great friend' while imposing his ambitious retaliatory tariff on India.Trump said Washington would impose ""discounted reciprocal tariffs "" of 26 per cent on New Delhi.""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right.' They charge us 52 per cent. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing, for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, we started with China and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China in tariffs,"" Trump said holding the chart that mentioned list of countries and tariff charges.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington, D.C., in February, less than a month after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term in the White House.Trump has previously referred to India as the "" tariff king "" and a ""big abuser"" in global trade . During a joint press conference with Modi at the White House on February 13, Trump remarked that India had ""been very strong on tariffs,"" adding, ""I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.""Highlighting the US trade deficit with India, which he estimated at nearly $100 billion, Trump stated that he and Modi had agreed to begin negotiations to correct ""long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last four years – but they didn't do that."" The goal, he said, was to ""sign an agreement"" that would create ""a level playing field, which we really think we're entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we're going to work on that very hard.""While announcing the new tariffs, Trump defended the move by saying the US had been ""very kind"" to trading partners and would now charge them ""approximately half of the levies they impose on US goods.""","US President Donald Trump announced a retaliatory tariff of 26 per cent on India.

MPEI is one of the flagship institutions under Russian Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom 's core and partner university network.Hemangi chose to specialise in illumination engineering and sources of light, an area she describes as the “perfect blend of science and art”. “It’s not directly related to nuclear science but is highly affected by nuclear energy. The cheaper and easier the access is to electricity in a country, the more illuminated its streets are,” Hemangi said.Speaking about her main motivation for applying to the MSCF programme, she said in 2023, she attended World Youth Festival in Sirius, Russia, organised by Rosatom, where “a very inspiring female Turkish professor explained how nuclear energy is in everything, a part of everything, even in light”.The MSCF programme, supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was launched in 2020 to encourage more women to enter and thrive in the nuclear sector. The programme supports talented students pursuing nuclear-related studies at the master's level year; one hundred and more young women scientists from all over the world become its fellows. Since the programme was launched, 560 students from 121 countries have been selected from over 2,200 applications.Rosatom, which is the largest producer of low-carbon electricity in Russia and generating approximately 20% of the nation's power, has been a key partner of IAEA's MSCF programme, supporting around 40 female students from 17 countries over the past four years. This academic year, 12 students from their flagship universities across 10 countries, including Armenia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe, received the scholarship, which covers tuition, internships, a monthly stipend and additional financial support from Rosatom.“We attach great importance to the fact that our values coincide with those of IAEA, and we can work together to ensure that there are more bright and talented women in the nuclear sector who contribute to the development of nuclear technologies and increase trust to green nuclear energy,” Vera Upirova, senior manager of Project Office for Education Development and International Cooperation of Rosatom, said.","Hemangi Shrivastava, an Indian student pursuing her master’s degree in electronics and nano electronics at Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI), has been awarded the prestigious Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme for women in nuclear science.

Average adoption waiting period climbs to 3.5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/average-adoption-waiting-period-climbs-to-3-5-years/articleshow/119923009.cms,"NEW DELHI: Eager to embrace parenthood after she suffered a miscarriage, Moumita Das and her husband, in their 30s, from West Bengal registered with Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) in Sept 2021 to adopt a child. It is 2025 and the couple, though has slowly moved up the waiting list, is still anxiously awaiting its turn to be matched with a child in the 0-2 years age group.Even as the number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2024-25, as of March 31, the highest in 11 years, for many prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) the process of adopting a child continues to be a challenge, with an average three and a half years waiting period for those seeking infants or young children. Most parents want to adopt a child in the 0-2 years age group.Swarnamala Arunachalam and her husband Prasanna Sukumar from Chennai, also in their 30s, have been in the queue since Dec 2021. They too are still waiting to be matched with siblings in the age group. The couple chose to go for adoption of siblings over having biological children right from the time they got married. They registered with Cara on their second anniversary but the long wait has left the couple anxious. They hope for a referral this year.With the years rolling by and many more processes to clear after being matched with a child, PAPs to whom TOI spoke to define their mental state as one where it seems like a ""race against time"" with age catching up and uncertainty growing.The numbers reflect the distress.

""...Parents want to adopt younger children only, thus leaving behind a large number of older children,"" the ministry said.The WCD ministry has also shared that based on the availability of the registered children and registered PAPs ratio, an average of three and a half years is the waiting period for infants and young children.","The number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2024-25, as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.

Lok Sabha passes Waqf Bill 288-232 after marathon 12-hour debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ls-passes-waqf-bill-288-232-after-marathon-12-hr-debate/articleshow/119918879.cms,"Kiren Rijiju: Bill has nothing to do with religion, just properties

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill after fierce discussion for over 12 hours with the govt countering the opposition's charges of encroachment on constitutional and Muslim rights and attacks on federalism with a strong defence of the changes in the Act governing Islamic endowments.The bill was adopted by 288 votes in favour and 232 against, thanks to support from BJP's 'secular' allies, which helped more than bridge the gap between the party's own numbers and the majority mark. BJP, in any case, was always confident of prevailing in the contest and its confidence came through clearly in home minister Amit Shah's feisty ""you carried out the changes only to keep your vote bank intact, and we have decided to cancel it"" declaration.The bill is expected to comfortably clear the numbers test in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. Although the debate in LS followed the by-now familiar 'secular versus communal' trajectory, the smooth passage of the bill marked an important juncture. Coming after the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which was opposed on the ground of being allegedly anti-Muslim, criminalisation of triple talaq and enactment of the Uniform Civil Code in Uttarakhand, passage of the Waqf Bill marked the fourth instance where the BJP govt has had its way despite the combined resistance of Muslim outfits and secular parties.In fact, the latest success counts even more because it was pulled off despite BJP lacking a majority and with the support of 'secular' allies who, it seems, are confident of not ending up being losers in the bargain - something which perhaps reflects the assessment that any loss of Muslim support for them would be more than compensated by gains from the partnership with BJP.Shah's intervention came during the daylong debate that witnessed a fierce exchange between the two sides, with Congress deputy leader in LS Gaurav Gogoi alleging that the bill was an attempt to attack the basic structure of the Constitution, defame minorities, disenfranchise them and divide society. In his opening remarks, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju rejected the allegation that the proposed law was an interference in the constitutionally guaranteed freedom in religious affairs.Rijiju said the bill had nothing to do with religion, but dealt only with properties. ""The govt is not going to interfere in any religious institution. The changes made in the waqf law by the UPA govt gave it an overriding effect over other laws, hence the new amendments were required,"" he said amid noisy opposition protests.BJP was bolstered by a show of support from its key allies TDP, JDU, Shiv Sena and LJP, while the INDIA bloc put up a united show in opposing the bill.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claimed that the bill was BJP's ploy for polarisation following its reverses in the Lok Sabha polls, and said it would send a wrong message to the world, denting the country's secular image. The bill would prove to be BJP's ""Waterloo"" as some of its allies might be supporting the bill but they were not happy about the development inside, he added.After most of the leading opposition leaders had spoken, Shah launched a stout defence of the bill and rejected the criticism that appointment of non-Muslims in waqf councils and boards violated the community's right to manage its own affairs.Former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said over the years, Congress only paid lip service to the cause of minorities but did nothing to empower them. He also referenced the Shah Bano case, accusing Congress of undermining legal reforms for political gains. ""When Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shah Bano, the Rajiv Gandhi govt overturned the decision for vote-bank politics. Congress had 400 seats then but never got a majority after that. Today, they continue to oppose necessary reforms for political reasons,"" he said.Along with the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, Rijiju also moved the Mussalman Waqf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, which was passed in the Lok Sabha.","Lok Sabha passes the Waqf (Amendment) Bill after fierce discussion for over 12 hours.

Who are you trying to scare? It's the parliament's law, everyone will follow and accept it"". Shah had said.Amit Shah further clarified that Waqf is a charitable endowment and government properties cannot be donated.

Challenges and reforms in Waqf board management

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday saw a heated debate as Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government and the opposition clashed over the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, tabled by minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju. Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi criticised the proposed changes, calling them an attack on the Constitution’s basic structure. He accused the government of diluting constitutional safeguards, defaming minorities, and dividing society.Defending the amendments, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad asserted they were necessary to prevent misuse and illegal occupation. He claimed many Waqf lands were vacant or being looted, requiring government intervention for regulation.Waqf refers to assets set aside solely for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law, with any other use or sale of the property being forbidden.The Waqf properties in India constitute a vast network of religious, commercial, and agricultural assets. According to the Waqf Assets Management System of India, the country has 8,72,324 immovable Waqf properties, making it one of the largest repositories of religious and community-owned land in the world.Graveyards account for 1,50,516 properties (17%), while mosques make up 1,19,200 properties (14%). Commercial establishments such as shops (1,13,187) and houses (92,505) play an economic role, while agricultural land comprises 1,40,784 properties (16%). Religious sites like dargahs and mazars total 33,492 properties.The proposed amendments introduce stricter criteria for Waqf declarations. Only practising Muslims for at least five years can dedicate property to Waqf, reverting to pre-2013 rules. Women must receive their rightful inheritance before any Waqf declaration, with provisions to safeguard widows, divorced women, and orphans.The Waqf Board has digitised 330,000 records to improve transparency, but several challenges persist. Concerns have been raised over governance, mismanagement, and legal disputes surrounding Waqf properties.One major issue is the irrevocable nature of Waqf properties, leading to prolonged legal battles. Courts have questioned claims over lands, such as two islands in Bet Dwarka, highlighting ambiguities in ownership. Encroachments, fraudulent registrations, and a lack of coordination with revenue authorities further complicate matters.There is also criticism of the Waqf Act, 1995, particularly regarding the lack of judicial oversight. Tribunal decisions cannot be challenged in higher courts, raising concerns about accountability. Additionally, delays in property surveys—especially in states like Gujarat and Uttarakhand—have hindered effective management.Cases of misuse have also surfaced, with Section 40 of the Waqf Act allegedly used to claim properties without due process. This has led to disputes and unrest in communities. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, an entire village was controversially claimed as Waqf land, leaving residents struggling to assert ownership.To address these issues, the Ministry of Minority Affairs has initiated reforms, consulting stakeholders and examining international practices in countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Key proposals include restructuring tribunals, improving property registration processes, and enforcing stricter accountability measures for Waqf Boards and Mutawallis.","India has a staggering 8,72,324 Waqf properties spread across different states and union territories.

Lack of expertise and coordination with the revenue department has further slowed registration. Misuse: Some state Waqf boards have misused their powers, creating community tensions. Section 40 of the Waqf Act has been widely misused to declare private properties as Waqf, leading to legal disputes. Of 30 States/UTs, only 8 have reported, with 515 properties declared as Waqf under Section 40.

Of 30 States/UTs, only 8 have reported, with 515 properties declared as Waqf under Section 40. Constitutional validity: The Waqf Act applies solely to one religion, with no similar law for others. A PIL in the Delhi high court questions its constitutionality, prompting the court to request a response from the central government.

NEW DELHI: The central government tabled the Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on Wednesday amid strong resistance from the opposition.While the BJP-led government claims that the bill would improve the administration and management of Waqf properties in the country, the opposition has termed it a ""targeted legislation"" and ""fundamentally against the Constitutional provisions.""BJP's allies -- TDP and JDU -- have offered their support to the bill, with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar-led JDU urging the legislation's implementation not be retroactive.The name of the two bills are- Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2024. It was introduced in the Lok Sabha on August 8, 2024.It aims to modify the Waqf Act, 1995, to address challenges in the regulation and oversight of Waqf properties. The proposed amendments focus on enhancing the administration and ensuring more effective management of Waqf assets across India.Following are the issues regarding the Waqf board, according to the central government:In central Waqf council, 2 out of 22 members (excluding ex-officio) can be non-Muslims.In state Waqf boards, 2 out of 11 members (excluding ex-officio) can be non-Muslims.Muslim-created trusts will no longer be considered Waqf, ensuring full control over trusts.A centralized portal will automate Waqf property management, improving efficiency and transparency.Only practicing Muslims, for at least five years, can dedicate their property to Waqf, restoring pre-2013 rules.Registered properties remain Waqf unless disputed or identified as government land.Women must receive their inheritance before Waqf dedication, with special provisions for widows, divorced women, and orphans.Mutawallis must register property details on the central portal within six months.An officer above the rank of Collector will investigate government properties claimed as Waqf.A structured selection process and fixed tenure will ensure efficient dispute resolution.Two non-Muslim members will be included in the Central and State Waqf Boards for inclusivity.Waqf institutions' mandatory contribution to Waqf Boards will be reduced from 7% to 5%.The Limitation Act, 1963, will now apply to Waqf property claims, reducing prolonged litigation.Waqf institutions earning over Rs 1 lakh must undergo audits by State-appointed auditors.Section 40 is removed, preventing Waqf Boards from arbitrarily declaring properties as Waqf.","The Waqf Act, 1995, and its 2013 amendment have been ineffective, leading to issues such as illegal land occupation, mismanagement, ownership disputes, delays in registration and surveys, and a surge in litigation and complaints to the ministry. Poor performance by the survey commissioner has caused delays, with surveys yet to begin in Gujarat and Uttarakhand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119893847,imgsize-1752558,width-400,resizemode-4/119893847.jpg"

This bill is going to be passed by Parliament and will apply to all. The coming law will be an enactment of govt of India and every citizen will be obliged to comply with it.""In a forceful intervention which saw him alternating between dismissal of opposition's criticism as scaremongering and a staunch defence of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill as a necessity for checking corruption and arbitrariness of the waqf bureaucracy, Shah said, ""They are making misleading claims to scare Muslims so that their vote bank remains intact.""He cited provisions of the bill to argue that it was not an encroachment on the religious rights of Muslims, and pointed out that despite the opposition's claims to the contrary over amendments to the Citizenship Act, ""not a single Muslim has lost his citizenship because of CAA"". He said the bill covered waqf boards, waqf councils and waqf tribunals which were administrative bodies, and did not extend to management of mosques which would remain under Muslims.Shah criticised changes in the Waqf Act carried out by the Congress-led UPA govt in 2013 as part of the ""politics of appeasement"". He said the latest version of the Act more than doubled the area under waqf properties - from 18 lakh acres to 39 lakh acres. The home minister also pointed out that the orders of waqf tribunals were rendered immune from judicial scrutiny, with revenue courts and civil courts being divested of the power to hear appeals.""These days, it is fashionable to move around brandishing the Constitution. Can anything be more unconstitutional than putting a body above judicial scrutiny? You changed the law for politics of vote bank and we have now cancelled the changes,"" Shah said, pointedly refuting the contention of Congress's deputy leader in LS Gaurav Gogoi who had said that appeals against orders of tribunals were not barred. ""You have tried to mislead. Civil suits, where the interests of original occupants are given precedence, were indeed barred. Only writs were allowed. You know the difference but you are obfuscating it only for the sake of vote bank politics,"" he added.Shah argued that the changes would benefit Muslim masses by bringing transparency and eliminating corruption. ""In 2013, 20,000 properties were shown as leased. Now, the latest records show there are none. What happened? Were the properties sold off?"" he asked.The minister used other tracks as well - playing up support for the bill from a host of Christian bodies, claims made by waqf bodies on lands associated with temples and churches, and provisions of the bill which stipulate that land owned by SCs/STs would not come under waqf. He also struck an assertive note with regard to other provisions, such as that a Muslim can donate only his personal wealth and assets to waqf, that is, an Islamic endowment. ""How can one donate a govt or public property to waqf?"" he asked.Shah concluded by expressing confidence that Muslims would realise the benefit of the amendments. ""In four years, even Muslim brothers will realise that this bill is actually in their benefit,"" he said.","Home minister Amit Shah says changes being carried out in the Waqf Act will be firmly enforced.

""Judicial review is not permissible before a decision is taken by the speaker,"" he said, adding that court could just request the speaker in this case.The court, however, asked what would happen if an MLA defected after one month of election and the Speaker did not take a decision for five years and the tenure of assembly came to an end.""No direction can be passed to take a decision in a particular way but it can be directed that the decision is taken within a reasonable time.

Waqf Amendment Bill: Why Muslims are opposing it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-amendment-bill-why-muslims-are-opposing-it/articleshow/119905795.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Muslim organisations and leaders strongly opposed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill tabled by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Parliament on Wednesday. They argue that the proposed changes will be detrimental rather than beneficial to the Muslim community. They claim that the Bill is an attempt to weaken the autonomy of Waqf properties and seize lands that have been historically dedicated for religious and charitable purposes.Senior members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) have denounced the Bill, stating that their concerns were disregarded by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). ""The AIMPLB and other Muslim organizations have conveyed their concerns over the Bill to the JPC, but they were not considered,"" said Maulana Khalid Rashi Farangi Mahali, a senior executive member of the Board, to PTI.He emphasised that Waqf properties hold deep religious significance, comparable to fundamental Islamic practices, and that any amendment affecting their status is unacceptable. ""We have urged all MPs to consider the sentiments of the Muslim community and reject the proposed amendments,"" he added.In Bareilly, Ittihad-e-Millat Council chief Maulana Tauqeer Raza expressed outright rejection of the Bill, stating that it will not be accepted under any circumstances. ""We cannot approve any such Bill, nor can we support anything that goes beyond the constitutional framework. We will oppose the Waqf (Amendment) Bill through democratic means,"" he asserted.He also pointed out that there has not been sufficient resistance to the Bill so far and accused the government of misrepresenting the issue. ""We are accused of making illegal encroachments on Waqf properties, but our ancestors dedicated their properties to Waqf. Many rulers did the same, building temples and donating properties to them. Now, those very properties are being taken away,"" he said.Maulana Tauqeer Raza further alleged that the Bill is designed to harass Muslims and seize their lands under the guise of reform. ""How has the BJP suddenly become such a well-wisher of Muslims? This is sheer deception in the name of protecting Muslim interests,"" he remarked.Another aspect fueling the protests is the 'waqf by user' classification. The Waqf Act of 1954 classified properties under the designation of ""waqf by user"". According to this provision, a property gains waqf status if it has served religious or charitable functions over an extended period, regardless of formal paperwork. However, the suggested legislation eliminates this provision, creating uncertainty about the status of numerous such properties.Meanwhile, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi contended that the legislation targets Muslims' religious liberties. The AIMIM president further elaborated that the bill fundamentally contradicts Articles 14, 25, 26 and 29 of the Indian Constitution. He dismissed the legislation, stating that rather than being a Waqf Bill, it should be termed a ""Waqf Barbaad Bill.""Additionally, the bill mandates the inclusion of non-Muslims in the Central Waqf Council and state waqf boards, which critics argue interferes with Muslim religious affairs.Another provision allows an officer above the rank of collector to investigate government properties claimed as Waqf, with the final decision on ownership shifting from Waqf tribunals to senior government officials, which some believe will lead to political bias. Despite the widespread opposition from Muslim groups, some legal experts have defended certain provisions of the Bill. In Varanasi, lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain argued that the Bill curtails the unchecked powers of Waqf boards, calling it a ""positive step."" However, he acknowledged that certain aspects require further debate. ""There is no provision to take back the property of any other religion or trust which has been declared as Waqf property. We have registered our protest against this,"" he said.The opposition to the Bill has also been echoed in Parliament, where no bipartisan consensus has been reached. The ruling National Democratic Alliance remains firm on pushing the amendments, while opposition parties have criticized the Bill as ""unconstitutional"" and harmful to the Muslim community.The bill amendment specifies that Muslim-established trusts under any legal framework will be excluded from Waqf classification, ensuring complete authority over these entities.The bill reinstates pre-2013 regulations, stipulating that only individuals who have been practising Muslims for a minimum of five years can allocate their property to Waqf. Additionally, it mandates that women must receive their inherited share before any Waqf declarations, whilst incorporating specific provisions to safeguard the interests of widows, divorced women and orphans.",Muslim organisations and leaders strongly opposed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill tabled by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Parliament on Wednesday.

Nitish, who has been the dominant partner of the NDA in Bihar for nearly two decades, is perhaps for the first time following the politics of his now-dominant ally - the BJP.Interestingly, while the BJP, and even the opposition parties in Bihar, may make some gains from Waqf politics, Nitish Kumar's JD(U) will keep its fingers crossed - as the party had, over the years, found considerable support among the minorities in the state despite its alliance with the saffron party.Little wonder, while the BJP went all out to push the legislation as a much-needed reform to end corruption and land grab in the name of Waqf, the JD(U) leaders were on the defensive announcing their party's support to the Bill.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it... As long as Nitish Kumar is in politics, the interests of the people will be protected,"" JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha had said on Tuesday highlighting his party's stand on the Waqf Amendment Bill.So, why is Nitish Kumar helping the BJP pass a Bill that many Muslims oppose?Political analyst NK Choudhary says Nitish Kumar knows exactly what he is doing. ""Polarisation is a reality in today's politics and Nitish Kumar knows that Waqf politics will make this divide stronger in Bihar. The way some opposition parties are blindly backing the Muslims on the Waqf Bill may see the fence-sitters, a lot of whom are Hindus, veering towards the NDA,"" NK Choudhary says.""Nitish may lose some Muslim votes, but that will be compensated by the gains the BJP makes so overall the NDA may in fact end up making gains in Bihar,"" he says.Another political analyst Kumar Vijay has an interesting take on Nitish Kumar's decision to back the Waqf Bill. ""Nitish Kumar backing the Waqf Bill is perhaps a well thought out strategy. Nitish is protecting the interests of his next generation (his son Nishant) and the JD(U) as a party is preparing for politics beyond Nitish Kumar,"" says Kumar Vijay.""Nitish may lose some Muslim votes, but he knows the future prospects of his party is safer with the BJP than the RJD as Tejashwi is already an established player and his son would be completely overshadowed in any possible alliance with Lalu's party,"" he says.""The BJP also stands to gain by keeping the JD(U) in its fold as caste survey has revealed that Nitish Kumar's support base in the state remains quite significant,"" he adds.Interestingly, both the analysts feel that Waqf Bill may end up helping the NDA in Bihar. Assembly elections in Bihar are still some months away. The opposition's Mahagathbandhan would go all out to corner the NDA, especially Nitish Kumar over his support to the Waqf Bill. While the BJP may not mind this opposition offensive given the potential electoral gains that may come its way, it will be interesting to see how Nitish Kumar handles the pressure in the run up to elections.","Nitish Kumar is perhaps for the first time following the politics of his now- dominant ally - the BJP.

The minutes of the meet framing the new guidelines submitted in court revealed it would be attempting ""to define which medical competencies are essential and non-negotiable for safe medical practice"".Over the years, several candidates with disability have successfully challenged NMC's disability guidelines, based on which they were barred from joining for an MBBS course after clearing the national entrance examination. In the case of one such candidate, who reached Supreme Court seeking justice, the court had ordered a review of the guidelines which shall ""eschew from a benchmark model to test the functional competence of medical aspirants with disability"" in keeping with ""contemporary advancements in disability justice"".""From promoting self-rejection of disabled medical aspirants to assuming that their accommodations would lower the standard of competence and would regardless be fruitless - the guidelines have charted their way into disrepute,"" stated SC in its Oct 2024 order.Last month, NMC constituted a seven-member committee to review the disability guidelines published on May 14, 2015, by the erstwhile Medical Council of India.

Two of them, Dr Sanjay Wadhwa (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation) and Dr Rajesh Sagar (psychiatry), both fromAIIMS Delhi , have been members of all four committees so far that have worked on framing disability guidelines. Dr Achal Gulati (Ear, Nose Throat-ENT) from Maulana Azad Medical College, who heads the latest committee, was in three of these four committees. Three committees constituted earlier were dominated by doctors from AIIMS, Delhi. In the new seven-member committee, only three are from AIIMS.""AIIMS doesn't come under the NMC and so it is yet to revise its curriculum to align with the Competency-Based Medical Education curriculum of the NMC which was revised and issued in Sept last year. When AIIMS doesn't even follow a competency-based framework, how can it frame competency-based guidelines for NMC institutions? The same people have been inducted into the committee when the guidelines they framed have been repeatedly challenged and found problematic. They will be reviewing their own guidelines. Aren't there any experts in the whole country barring AIIMS?"" asked Dr Satendra Singh, a disability rights activist and faculty in University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi.","The National Medical Commission is reviewing the disability guidelines for admission to medicine courses. This comes after Supreme Court directed that guidelines be reviewed to assess what such candidates can do rather than what they can't. The minutes of the meet framing the new guidelines revealed it would be attempting ""to define which medical competencies are essential and non- negotiable for safe medical practice""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119921299,imgsize-770033,width-400,resizemode-4/119921299.jpg"
Only 1 in 100 women aged 45+ get screened for breast cancer: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-1-in-100-women-aged-45-get-screened-for-breast-cancer-study/articleshow/119921166.cms,"NEW DELHI: Had it not been for a series of tests under her annual health policy, Sheetal Thakur (46) could have been left battling for life. The routine check-up turned out to be a life-saving event, revealing she had breast cancer and underlining the importance of early detection. She said as the disease was detected early, it didn't spread to her other organs, and a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, helped her recover faster.Unfortunately, cancer specialists say, most cases of breast cancer - the most common cancer among women in India - are detected late because of lack of routine screening. A study published in BMC Public Health recently shows the extent of this crisis.Examination of the breasts using X-ray, referred to as mammography in medical terms, is an important method to detect the cancer, and doctors advise that all women aged 40 and above should undergo the screening process at least once in two years.However, according to the study, only one in every 100 women aged 45 years and above in the country undergo mammography, which is lower than the mammography rates in African countries (4.5%). In Europe and the US, the periodic mammography rate is as high as 84%.The BMC research, led by Divya Khanna and Dipak Das from Tata Memorial Centres in Varanasi and Mumbai and Priyanka Sharma from the ESIC Medical College and Hospital in Faridabad, shows the highest prevalence of mammography in India is in Kerala (4.5%), followed by Karnataka (2.9%), Lakshadweep (2.7%) and Maharashtra (2.05%). In Delhi, the mammography rate is less than 1% among women aged 45 years and above.The study is based on data collected from 35,083 women in the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India, a nationwide representative survey, to find out how many of them had undergone mammography in the past two years. It revealed that only 1.3% of women had undergone mammography.Dr. P Raghu Ram, founding director, KIMS-USHALAKSHMI Centre for Breast Diseases, Hyderabad, said the main reasons why women hesitate to undergo a screening mammogram include lack of awareness and the fear of risk from radiation exposure which is a myth since modern day mammography (Digital and 3-D Mammography) involves only a tiny amount of radiation - even less than a standard chest X-ray.","Most cases of breast cancer are detected late because of lack of routine screening.

Trump’s Use of Reciprocal Tariffs

Poll Do you support the use of reciprocal tariffs as a trade strategy? No, it escalates trade tensions. Yes, it's a necessary approach.

Key Objectives

Reduce the U.S. trade deficit by discouraging imports and boosting domestic production.

Protect American industries from unfair competition.

Pressure trading partners to lower their own tariffs or renegotiate trade agreements with more favorable terms for the US.

Challenges and Criticisms

Higher Consumer Costs: Reciprocal tariffs could lead to increased prices for imported goods in the U.S., affecting consumers and businesses reliant on foreign products.

Global Trade Tensions : Countries targeted by the policy may retaliate with their own tariffs, escalating into broader trade disputes or even a trade war.

: Countries targeted by the policy may retaliate with their own tariffs, escalating into broader trade disputes or even a trade war. Implementation Complexity: Matching tariffs on a product-by-product basis is administratively challenging due to the vast number of goods traded globally.

Global Reaction

Reciprocal tariffs are a trade policy mechanism where a country imposes tariffs on imports that match the tariffs its exports face in foreign markets. The concept is rooted in the idea of fairness: if one country charges high tariffs on imported goods, the affected country responds with equivalent tariffs on goods coming from the first country. This approach aims to create a balanced trading environment by ensuring that no nation disproportionately benefits from lower trade barriers.For example, if Country A imposes a 25% tariff on steel imports from Country B, Country B would respond by imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports from Country A. The goal is to discourage protectionist policies and encourage countries to lower their tariffs through negotiation.President Donald Trump has made reciprocal tariffs a cornerstone of his trade policy, framing them as part of his broader “America First” agenda. On April 2, 2025, Trump officially unveiled his reciprocal tariff plan, calling it a necessary step to combat what he describes as decades of unfair trade practices by foreign nations. He declared the day “Liberation Day for American Trade,” signaling his administration’s commitment to leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses.Trump’s plan targets countries that impose higher tariffs on American exports than the U.S. imposes on their goods. For instance, India charges a 100% tariff on American motorcycles, while the U.S. imposes only a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles. Under Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy, the U.S. would raise its tariff on Indian motorcycles to match India’s rate.Trump argues that reciprocal tariffs will:The policy is particularly focused on countries with significant trade surpluses with the United States, such as China, India, and members of the European Union. These nations often maintain higher average tariff rates compared to the U.S., which Trump claims puts American exporters at a disadvantage.While Trump’s supporters hail the policy as a bold step toward trade fairness, critics warn of potential downsides:Economists also question whether reciprocal tariffs will effectively reduce trade imbalances. Many argue that factors like currency valuation and domestic consumption patterns play a larger role in creating trade deficits than tariff disparities.The announcement has already drawn criticism from major trading partners. China and the European Union have labeled the policy as protectionist, while developing nations like India fear economic repercussions if subjected to equivalent U.S. tariffs.","Reciprocal tariffs are a trade policy mechanism where a country imposes tariffs on imports that match the tariffs its exports face in foreign markets.

DOGE, Tesla Takedown and silent exit?



Musk is likely to retain an informal role



130-day special government employee status



President Donald Trump has told his inner circle that Elon Musk will be stepping back from his current role though Trump is very happy with whatever Elon Musk is doing, according to reports. A Politico report said that the decision is not his unilateral and both Trump and Musk discussed it in recent days and it will soon be time for Musk to return to his businesses. ""He's got a big company to run ... At some point he's going to be going back,"" Trump reportedly said about Elon Musk. ""He wants to. I'd keep him as long as I could keep him.""Trump said that the heads of agencies who worked with DOGE learned a lot and there will be a point at which the secretaries will be able to do this work, Axios reported.""Musk’s looming retreat comes as some Trump administration insiders and many outside allies have become frustrated with his unpredictability and increasingly view the billionaire as a political liability, a dynamic that was thrown into stark relief Tuesday when a conservative judge Musk vocally supported lost his bid for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat by 10 points,"" the Politico report said.Elon Musk's entry into Donald Trump's inner circle happened before the election when he endorsed Trump unequivocally. His promotion was rapid as he became the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency, and then the sole head. With a mandate to cut down the expenses of the government, he freely wielded his chainsaw with the approval of the President and suggested shutting down several departments, curtailing the function of some others. As his DOGE is still at their one-year mandate, Elon Musk attempted to play a bigger role in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election but fell flat as Brad Schimel, the candidate he was backing lost to Susan Crawford.Meanwhile, Elon Musk's business took a major hit with Tesla shares plunging amid a global call to 'Takedown Tesla' by protesters who do not want Elon Musk's interference in the government.The Politico report quoted one senior administration official who said Elon Musk is likely to retain an informal role as an adviser. But another said Musk is not going anywhere and those who think Musk is going to disappear entirely from Trump's orbit are fooling themselves.Elon Musk was made a special government employee -- who join the government for a short period of time -- by the Trump administration. The time frame is 130 days or less. In a recent interview with Fox News, Musk spoke about how the maximum of his work is supposed to be done within 130 days. If the 130-day count started on Jan. 20, Musk would be done at the end of May. If only weekdays are counted, his tenure could stretch into July.","Elon Musk was made a special government employee -- who join the government for a short period of time.

What Donald Trump announced:

Trump's reciprocal tariffs

This is the full list of reciprocal tariffs that Trump announced:

The risks for India

It's important to note that the exact impact of Trump's reciprocal tariffs on various sectors in India will be easier to analyse as more details emerge.

Ahead of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs announcement, a few days ago a Citi Research report warned that the move could mean possible annual losses up to $7 billion.

Citi analysts have identified chemicals, metal products and jewellery as sectors facing the highest vulnerability, whilst automobiles, pharmaceuticals and food products remain substantially exposed.

India's merchandise exports to the United States totalled around $74 billion in 2024, with pearls, gems and jewellery accounting for $8.5 billion, pharmaceuticals contributing $8 billion, and petrochemicals amounting to approximately $4 billion.

According to Morgan Stanley, India faces potential risks to its pharmaceutical exports, which make up 2.8% of total exports and 0.3% of GDP, as these items have been identified as possible targets for tariffs.

Although a trade deal between India and the US could be reached by autumn 2025, the negotiations are expected to be intricate and lengthy, owing to various trade-related complexities between the two nations, Morgan Stanley has said.

Products from various industries such as agriculture, precious stones, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electrical components and machinery could face adverse effects if the United States implements retaliatory tariffs on items originating from India, industry specialists have indicated.

Based on GTRI's analysis, fish, meat and processed seafood exports, valued at $2.58 billion in 2024, would be most severely affected, facing a substantial 27.83 per cent tariff difference. The introduction of US tariffs will notably reduce the competitiveness of shrimp exports to America.

Additionally, India's exports of processed food, sugar and cocoa products, which reached $1.03 billion last year, are likely to be impacted due to a significant tariff disparity of 24.99 per cent.

How is India preparing for US tariffs?

India is developing a comprehensive strategy to strengthen economic ties with the United States. India is evaluating several scenarios to understand the potential impact of reciprocal tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump on April 2, according to officials.

The governments of India and the United States have established a timeline to finalise the initial phase of their agreement by September-October 2025. Additionally, both nations have set an ambitious objective to escalate their two-way trade from the current $190 billion to $500 billion by 2030, which is a substantial increase of more than twofold.

The commerce and industry ministry has developed various models considering tariff differences and duties that Trump has implemented across different nations and industries to safeguard American manufacturing.

Officials from the ministry have engaged with local manufacturers to understand the non-tariff obstacles their products encounter in the US market.

Additionally, the ministry is collecting input from Indian businesses regarding non-tariff restrictions encountered during US exports. A dedicated online platform for documenting such export barriers is scheduled to launch within the next two months.

The Nomura report indicates that India is prepared to negotiate a broad trade and investment agreement, offering reduced tariffs on specific products including pork, premium medical devices and luxury motorcycles, whilst providing production-linked incentives for shipping and support for logistics firms.

India also plans to increase its procurement of US products across multiple sectors, encompassing defence equipment, aircraft, oil and gas, technology and medical diagnostic equipment.

To establish itself as a credible alternative to Chinese manufacturing, India is offering enhanced incentives, including tax benefits and simplified land access in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. These benefits target sectors like semiconductors, electronics, aircraft components and renewable energy.

India aims to integrate into US supply chains by extending concessions to US firms that establish production facilities in India for fundamental and intermediate products, including basic semiconductors, solar panels, machinery and pharmaceutical items, the Nomura report said.

US President Donald Trump has unveiled extensive reciprocal tariff proposals, declaring ""our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered"" by foreign nations. During his speech on ‘Liberation Day’,""My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day, waiting for a long time. April 2nd, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to Make America Wealthy Again...Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,"" Trump declared during his White House address. ""But it is not going to happen anymore.""As per the board held up by Trump, the tariffs charged by India to the US are 52% and the ‘discounted’ reciprocal tariffs by US will be 26%.Also Check | Donald Trump tariff announcements live According to Trump, the US imposes a modest 2.4 per cent tariff on imported motorcycles, whilst other nations implement substantially higher rates. “The United States charges other countries only a 2.4 per cent tariff on motorcycles. Meanwhile, Thailand and others are charging much higher rates, like 60 per cent. India charges 70 per cent, Vietnam charges 75 per cent, and others charge even higher rates,” he said.""Likewise, until today, the United States has, for decades, charged a 2.5 per cent tariff. Think of that 2.5 per cent on foreign-made automobiles. The European Union charges us more than 10 per cent tariffs, and they have a 20 per cent VAT much, much higher. India charges 70 per cent and perhaps worst of all are the non-monetary restrictions imposed by South Korea, Japan, and many other nations as a result of these colossal trade barriers.""""India, very, very tough. Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left. He's a great friend of mine, but I said, 'You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right. They charge us 52%. You have to understand, we charge them almost nothing for years and years and decades, and it was only seven years ago, when I came in, that we started with China,"" Trump added.1. China: 34%2.

Sri Lanka: 44%25. Colombia: 10%A recent SBI Research report said that the impact of Trump’s tariffs is likely to be limited. This sentiment is echoed by several global research and ratings firms and banks such as Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Morgan Stanley and Fitch.According to the SBI analysis, the potential impact of US tariff reciprocity on Indian exports would be modest. It projected a reduction of approximately 3 to 3.5 per cent, with an assumption of tariffs ranging between 15 and 20 per cent.The report indicates that India's strategic approach to export diversification, emphasis on value addition, exploration of alternative markets, and development of new trade routes from Europe to USA through the Middle-East would offset the effects of US tariffs.Goldman Sachs notes that India’s gross exports to the US is one of the lowest among its Emerging Market peers. Fitch says India’s low reliance on external demand makes it ‘somewhat insulated’.Based on Nomura's recent findings, India stands as one of Asia's most resilient economies in the ongoing trade conflict.The country's exposure remains limited, with exports to the US constituting only 2.2% of its GDP, whilst Vietnam shows significantly higher exposure at 25.1%.Nomura's study on Asian contribution to US-bound global exports identifies Vietnam as having the highest risk exposure (8.9% of GDP), with other nations following: Taiwan (6.3%), Thailand (5.6%), Malaysia (4.6%), Singapore (4.5%) and South Korea (4.5%). The electronics and computing sector faces substantial risks from tariff-induced supply chain disruptions.Across industries, Asian economies show highest susceptibility to automotive tariffs, followed by semiconductors and steel sectors as the next most exposed areas.Morgan Stanley says, “While India is exposed to direct tariff risks, we have consistently highlighted that the bigger effect on growth from tariffs likely comes via the indirect transmission channel of weaker corporate confidence from heightened policy uncertainty and the spillovers to capex and trade cycle. From this perspective, India's low goods trade orientation and ability to generate domestic demand offset mean it is among the least exposed economies within the region from an indirect effect standpoint.”Despite the looming impact from Trump’s tariff moves, global economists believe India will continue to be the fastest growing economy in the world. According to the IMF's January World Economic Outlook, India will become the world’s third largest economy in the coming years.A Financial Times report citing Aston University's econometric research says that severe global retaliation against Trump's proposed 25% tariffs could result in a $1.4 trillion reduction in global income and significantly impact international trade.Initial analysis suggests India could potentially benefit alongside the UK, Japan, and South Korea. These nations might experience increased export opportunities in areas where US buyers seek alternatives to suppliers affected by tariff barriers. The trade diversion could particularly favour India.India's prospects appear promising in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles sectors, which align with the ""Make in India"" programme. The country's emerging status as a manufacturing alternative to China, combined with its independence from major trade groups like the EU, could make it an attractive supplier during uncertain times.However, these advantages are limited and temporary. As noted by a senior economist at a New Delhi-based think tank: ""India might benefit from a few supply chain shifts, but if the global trade environment turns volatile, capital flows will become unstable, inflation will rise, and the ripple effects will catch up.""Additionally, India's reliance on imported energy, machinery, and sophisticated components poses risks. A widespread trade conflict would increase import costs, potentially leading to higher inflation and reduced government fiscal flexibility. The Reserve Bank of India, already concerned about food prices, might need to implement stricter monetary policies, potentially affecting economic growth.Ultimately, whilst India might experience initial advantages, it remains vulnerable to the broader negative consequences of global trade disruption.","India's merchandise exports to the United States totalled around $74 billion in 2024, with pearls, gems and jewellery accounting for $8.5 billion, pharmaceuticals contributing $8 billion, and petrochemicals amounting to approximately $4 billion. Citi Research report warned that the move could mean possible annual losses up to $7 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119917420,imgsize-83842,width-400,resizemode-4/119917420.jpg"

Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy claims descent from Mughal emperor



Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy’s controversial claims on the Taj Mahal and Ayodhya land



Prince Tucy’s role as caretaker of Aurangzeb’s grave

India's monarchical dynasties, once ruling large portions of the subcontinent, were in effect eradicated with the nation's declaration as a republic in 1947. With India's independence, the monarchy system was abolished de jure and democracy was in the spotlight. Even though royal rule has ceased, numerous offspring of these previously influential families remain living in India, profiting from a blood relationship with their vaunted forbears and, in numerous instances, claiming ownership of their ancestors' properties and lands. Among them are influential members like Maharani Rajikaraje Gaekwad and Princess Diya Kumari of Rajasthan, influential individuals from the royal circle living in India.One such person creating ripples in the royal world is Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy, who alleges being a descendant of the Mughal emperors. The prince has stepped into the limelight announcing himself as the sixth-generation heir of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last emperor of the Mughals, which connects his lineage to great Mughal emperors like Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan, and Akbar. Prince Tucy has been in the news for claiming rights to some of India's most important symbols of Mughal heritage, such as the Taj Mahal and the problematic Ayodhya Ram Mandir site.Currently, he lives in Hyderabad and is the Mutawalli and caretaker of Aurangzeb’s grave.Prince Tucy's most notorious claim till date has been the one for owning the Taj Mahal, India's legendary white marble mausoleum erected by Shah Jahan for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. His claim was made years ago and caused great media attention. To validate his claims, the prince even filed a DNA report before the Hyderabad court, which was reportedly admitted by the court, going to further strengthen his daring claims.Apart from his assertion on the Taj Mahal, the prince was also embroiled in controversy during the Ayodhya Ram Mandir issue. At the center of controversy was land whose ownership belongs to many Hindus since they are sure that Lord Ram was born there, an icon in Hindu religion. Through the controversial argument that was rife at this time, Tucy rose to prominence when he challenged the Wakf board that had previously laid claim on the controversial property. As per the prince, if the property was connected to Babur, the Mughal emperor who had commissioned the building of the Babri Masjid on the land, then he and his family were the legitimate owners of it. He went on to declare that he had no problem if the Ram Temple were to be built on the property, even donating a golden brick for the temple itself along with the whole property in order to make the project feasible.Apart from his purported claims over these heritage sites, Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy is Mutawalli and Caretaker of Aurangzeb's Grave in Maharashtra. He takes charge of looking after the tomb of the controversial Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ruled much of India in the 17th century. The prince has been outspoken in calling for the protection of this historic monument, especially considering recent vandalism incidents. In one, Tucy petitioned the President of India, asking the government to do something to protect the monument. His petition stated, ""I request the government to take measures to protect the monument/grave of Aurangzeb Alamgeer RH.""Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy's public image is closely linked to his royal Mughal lineage. His fashion sense attests to the heritage, as he is typically dressed in the long, majestic robes and a similar cap that Mughal emperors used to wear. His fashion also supports the persona of a man of royal blood, one who prides himself on his heritage and the history that he comes from. His online profiles often reflect these traditional looks, harkening to the grandeur and gravitas of the Mughal empire.","Prince Yakub Habeebuddin Tucy claims descent from Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar.

NEW DELHI: Self-styled 'prophet' Bajinder Singh who once claimed his ministry would be the world’s largest now faces life behind bars.His journey as a preacher began inside a jail cell, where he converted to Christianity while serving time for murder. Now, a Punjab court has sentenced him to life imprisonment in a 2018 rape case Singh, often referred to as the 'Yeshu Yeshu prophet,' had built his following on claims of miraculous healing and legal deliverance. After an income tax raid at his premises in January 2023, he had defiantly told his congregation, “Badnaam hue toh kya hua, naam toh hai” (So what if I am defamed? At least I have a name). His ministry even boasted of being the “World’s No. 1 Ministry.”His empire crumbled when a Mohali court found him guilty under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 506 (criminal intimidation).Singh, originally from a farming family in Haryana, was not always a preacher. His conversion to Christianity began inside a jail cell, where he was serving time in the early 2000s for a murder case.Claiming to have been haunted by 'demonic forces,' he turned to the Bible and later styled himself as a healer capable of curing ailments and resolving all troubles, including imprisonment.His ministry, which he boasted as the ""World's No. 1 Ministry,"" amassed a massive following, drawing in believers from across Punjab and beyond.However, his self-styled spiritual empire started to fall when a 22-year-old woman, a member of his team, accused him of sexual harassment, stalking, and criminal intimidation.On February 28, Mohali police registered a case against him, and CCTV footage later surfaced, showing him assaulting a woman in his office. His arrest and conviction followed soon after, with the court sentencing him to life imprisonment under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 506 (criminal intimidation).Singh, who claimed to have healed countless followers, ironically failed to cure his own ailments. Seeking a reduced sentence, he cited his health issues and family responsibilities, claiming this was his first conviction and that he had dedicated his life to religious and social work. He told the court that his large prayer gatherings supported thousands, including his minor children and ailing parents.He also mentioned that his wife suffered from a severe spinal problem, while he himself had a rod implanted in his leg, causing him continuous discomfort.As the court pronounced the life term, the victim, who had been suffering from panic attacks, fainted outside the courtroom. On regaining consciousness, she expressed her satisfaction with the verdict, calling Singh a ""fraud, bluff master, a cheater, and a hypocritical guru.""Singh's journey from a jailed murder accused to a self-styled preacher was already steeped in controversy. His ministry had been disowned by the Diocese of Jalandhar in 2018.Yet, he continued to expand his influence, garnering social media followers and even receiving endorsements from celebrities like Chunky Pandey and Aditya Pancholi.The rape case that led to his downfall dates back to 2017, when the victim first encountered Singh at a roadside eatery. Over time, he manipulated her into attending prayer meetings and joining his worship team, ultimately leading to years of exploitation.The victim alleged that he would force her to sit alone in his cabin on Sundays, where he would hug and touch her inappropriately. He even pressured her to marry him, despite being already married, and stalked her, threatening to harm her family if she refused his advances.Even after his conviction, Singh's followers gathered outside the court complex, though police prevented them from entering. His children, too, have come forward, claiming that their father is innocent and that the charges were fabricated to ""stop Jesus’s work.""Singh himself alleged that the case was part of a conspiracy by a rival pastor envious of his growing influence.

Babu Ahmed: AP shows remarkable turn around in GST collections: State chief commissioner of taxes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ap-shows-remarkable-turn-around-in-gst-collections-state-chief-commissioner-of-taxes-babu-ahmed/articleshow/119896868.cms,"GST gross collections for the year:



VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh has demonstrated remarkable resilience and efficiency in tax collection, successfully reversing the downward trend observed in November and December 2024.Through strategic policy implementation and improved compliance measures, the state achieved sustained growth in GST revenue during the first quarter of 2025, with March emerging as an exceptional month for revenue collection.In March 2025, net GST collections reached Rs 3,116 crores, marking the highest amount collected in the past 11 months and the second highest this year. “This impressive performance not only signifies effective tax administration but also reflects the positive economic momentum in the state.The steady increase in tax revenue underscores the strength of the state’s financial framework and the success of various initiatives designed to enhance tax compliance and enforcement,” said AP chief commissioner of taxes.He explained that the net GST collections in March 2025 represent the highest revenue for March since the introduction of the Andhra Pradesh Goods and Services Tax (APGST) Act in 2017.He said that March 2025 stands as the third-highest revenue-generating month in any financial year since the inception of the APGST regime, further emphasizing the remarkable nature of this achievement. “Net GST collections have shown an impressive surge of 8.35% in March 2025 compared to March 2024. This remarkable increase reflects strengthened tax compliance, improved settlement adjustments, and a broader tax base within the state.The cumulative net revenue collections for the financial year have increased by 5.09%, further emphasizing the state’s strong fiscal position and sustainable revenue inflows,” said Babu.This growth in net collections is particularly significant because net revenue represents the actual revenue accrued to the state after accounting for IGST settlements and other components. While gross collections reflect the total tax paid, net collections provide a more accurate indicator of the state's fiscal health by considering the actual revenues available for state expenditures.The cumulative growth figures from April 2024 to March 2025 further highlight this trend, with net collections increasing by 5.09% compared to the same period in the previous financial year, totalling Rs 33,660 crores against Rs 32,030 crores.In FY 2024-2025, GST gross collections increased by 1.19%, amounting to Rs 44,825 crores compared to Rs 44,298 crores in 2023-24. “The collection of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) has an indirect impact on the net revenues of the state.Under the IGST mechanism defined in the GST Act, the IGST paid by taxpayers within the state is transferred to other states, which affects the state's overall revenue share if taxpayers adjust the SGST credit against the IGST liability,” said Babu.IGST collections indirectly affect the net revenues of the state, as the IGST paid by the taxpayers of the state will be settled to other states according to the IGST mechanism under the GST Act . The primary reasons for the low growth in GST gross collections arise from the state's GDP predominantly depending on the primary sector, which is largely exempt from GST tax.Despite the challenges posed by a decline in petroleum product revenues—due to a decrease in the basic price set by the Government of India and policy changes—overall tax collections have continued on a positive trajectory. Additionally, the reduction in the retail price of liquor, which typically contributes significantly to state revenue, had an impact as well.Several key measures have contributed to this impressive growth, including enhanced return compliance, strengthened enforcement strategies, and the integration of interdepartmental data. Initiatives such as real-time monitoring of collections, round-the-clock vehicle checks to prevent tax evasion, and automation of tax scrutiny have significantly improved efficiency and accountability in tax administration.As the state continues to implement progressive tax policies and adopt digital innovations for compliance monitoring, the overall outlook for GST collections remains quite promising. With ongoing efforts to strengthen enforcement mechanisms and broaden the tax base, the state is poised for sustained revenue growth, enhancing its fiscal stability and economic development.The government is dedicated to enhancing taxpayer services, making compliance straightforward, and fostering a tax-friendly atmosphere that supports business growth while effectively contributing to the state's revenue increase.","In March 2025, net GST collections reached Rs 3,116 crores, marking the highest amount collected in the past 11 months and the second highest this year.

Acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul assured petitioners on Tuesday that their pleas-seeking protection of the disputed land, which falls under survey number 25 near University of Hyderabad-would be taken up urgently.The petitioners, retired scientist Kalapala Babu Rao and environmental body Vata Foundation, raised an alarm over large-scale land clearing at the site, allegedly using scores of excavators. They informed the court that destruction was progressing rapidly despite the area being classified as a ' deemed forest ,' warranting legal protection. While Babu Rao filed a fresh PIL, Vata Foundation's PIL was pending before court.According to the PILs, the Telangana govt, through GO No. 54 (issued on June 26, 2024), allocated this land to the Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC) for IT infrastructure development, with plans to sell it to tech companies at 75 crore per acre. However, the petitioners argued that this move violated a Supreme Court ruling in Ashok Kumar Sharma vs Union of India, which mandates states to protect deemed forests.Babu Rao urged the court to declare the site a national park under the Wildlife Protection Act, emphasising that it is home to rare plant, bird, and animal species. Reports surfaced that 30-40 JCBs had been deployed since March 30 to clear the forest.Petitioners also alleged that activists and students were forcibly detained in police stations, and prevented from intervening. ""Carcasses of dead animals are now being discovered, which is distressing,"" Babu Rao said. Babu Rao's counsel informed the bench that photos of the destruction had been submitted along with the PIL. The court is set to take up the matter on Wednesday, with both PILs heard together.","The Telangana high court will hear two public interest litigations (PILs) on Wednesday, challenging the ongoing clearing of 400 acres of forest land in Kancha Gachibowli.

Waqf showdown: Rijiju slams INDIA bloc, Congress hits back



Cash-rich Waqf board but Muslims remained poor in India: Rijiju in LS

""You tried to mislead people on issues which are not part of Waqf Bill,"" said minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju to the opposition in LS.

""A case ongoing since 1970 in Delhi involved several properties, including the CGO Complex and the Parliament building. The Delhi Waqf Board had claimed these as Waqf properties. The case was in court, but at that time, the UPA government denotified 123 properties and handed them over to the Waqf Board. If we had not introduced this amendment today, even the Parliament building we are sitting in could have been claimed as Waqf property. If PM Modi Govt did not come into power, several properties would have been de-notified,"" he said after introducing the bill.

""In 2013, right before Lok Sabha elections in 2014, there were some steps taken which will raise questions in your mind. In 2013, the act was changed to allow Sikhs, Hindus, Parsis and others to create Waqf. Everyone knows Waqf is for Muslims to create Waqf in the name of Allah. This change was made by Congress in 2013. Congress made the boards specifics, only Shias in Shia boards...A section was added that Waqf will have an overriding effect over every other law. How can this section be acceptable?"" he added.

""Changes made in Waqf law by UPA govt gave it overriding effect over other statutes, hence, new amendments were required,"" he said.

""This bill, which we are discussing, is not new. The history of this bill dates back to pre-Independence in 1913 when the 'Mussalman Waqf Validating Act' was passed. Later, in 1923, the 'Mussalman Waqf Act' was brought in, which accounting and transparency were in focus. After Independence, in 1954, Waqf Act was incorporated. State Waqf Board was included in this Waqf Act, 1954,"" he added.

""Waqf property private in nature, unfair to compare it with land banks of Railways, armed forces,"" Rijiju asserted.

""Waqf Bill to be renamed as Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) Bill,"" he announced.

""Now Shia, Sunni, Bohra, backward Muslims, women, and expert Non-Muslims will also be there in Waqf Board. Let me elaborate in detail. I'll give my own example. Suppose I am not a Muslim but I am minority affairs minister. Then I become Chairman of the Central Waqf Council. Despite my position, there can be a maximum of 4 Non-Muslim members in the Council, and among them, 2 women members are compulsory,"" he said.

""The provisions of the Waqf Board have nothing to do with the management of any mosque, temple, or religious site. It is simply a matter of property management. However, Waqf properties are managed by the Waqf Board and the Mutawalli. If someone fails to understand this basic distinction or deliberately chooses not to, then I have no solution for that,"" he asserted.

""There were some anomalies in this bill, so it was necessary to amend it. I had mentioned earlier that any any Indian could create a Waqf, but this was not the case in 1995. In 2013, you made changes, and now we have reinstated the 1995 provision, ensuring that only someone who has practiced Islam for a minimum of five years can create a Waqf,"" he said.

""The railway tracks, stations, and infrastructure belong to the nation, not just to Indian Railways. How can we equate railway property with Waqf property? Similarly, defence land, the second-largest landholder, is meant for national security and military training. How can that be compared to Waqf land? A lot of Waqf properties are private properties. That is why India has the largest amount of Waqf property in the world,"" he said.

""Cash-rich Waqf board but Muslims remained poor in India,"" Kiren Rijiju said in Lok Sabha.

""When our country has the largest Waqf property in the world, why hasn't it been used for the education, medical treatment, skill development, and income generation of poor Muslims? Why has no progress been made in this regard so far? If this government, under the leadership of PM Modi, is working for the betterment of poor Muslims, then why is there an objection?,"" he asked.

""On our own WAMSI portal, we have reviewed the records. The Sachar Committee, which was formed in 2006 has also provided detailed information on this matter. In 2006, there were 4.9 lakh Waqf properties, and the total income from them was Rs 163 crore and after making changes in 2013, the income has income Rs 166 crores,"" he continued.

""Today, the total Waqf property has increased from 4.9 lakh to 8.72 lakh in our country. If these 8.72 lakh Waqf properties were managed properly, it would not only improved the lives of Muslims but also transform the destiny of the entire country,"" Rijiju told the parliament.

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led central government tabled the Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on Wednesday amid opposition from INDIA bloc . The bill incorporates suggestions made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee that examined it. The House also took up the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2024, for consideration and passing.Rijiju during his arguments in the House said that the Waqf Bill have been renamed as the Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) Bill.""The Waqf (Amendment) Bill that we have introduced includes several recommendations from the JPC, which we have accepted and incorporated into this bill. It is wrong to say that recommendations from JPC has not been incorporated in this bill. One very important aspect of this bill is the new structured system. Waqf Bill has been renamed as the Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development (UMEED) Bill. This will give rise to a sense of hope,"" he said.Amidst a big showdown, Union minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha and defended the proposed reforms. He questioned the criticism, saying, ""Why are we being challenged when we are introducing positive changes? Those who have no direct involvement in the bill are being misled and provoked.""The debate on the bill began with Congress leader KC Venugopal, who opposed the bill, saying that the Centre was ""bulldozing the legislation"".""This type of bill ( Waqf Amendment Bill ) that you are bringing into the House, at least the members has to have the power to give amendments. You are bulldozing the legislation. This is this type of legislation. You need to give time for amendment. There are several provisions to be given amendment. There is no time at all,"" he said.To this, Union minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah dismissed the opposition to the bill, saying, ""It was your (opposition) insistence that a Joint Parliamentary Committee should be formed. We do not have a committee like the Congress. We have a democratic committee, which brainstorms,"" he said.. Our committee discusses, deliberates on the basis of discussions and makes changes. If the changes are not to be accepted, then what is the point of the committee?"" he added.Meanwhile, Speaker Om Birla assured that amendments from both government and opposition received balanced consideration from him.When RSP representative NK Premachandran raised procedural concerns, Home minister Amit Shah clarified that the union cabinet had approved the amendments within the bill, which stemmed from the JPC report. He concluded, ""There is no point of order.""The proceedings continued with staunch reply from Rijiju to opposition. He highlighted that the JPC's consultation process was the largest ever exercise carried out by a parliamentary panel in India's democratic history.He reported that the JPC received and reviewed more than 97.27 lakh submissions, including petitions and memorandums, through both physical and online formats before completing their report.The minister noted that 284 delegations presented their perspectives on the bill, alongside Waqf boards from 25 states and Union Territories.He mentioned that distinguished legal luminaries, charitable organisations, academicians and religious leaders, among others had also contributed their views.Deputy leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi opened the argument on behalf of the Congress during the debate after Rijiju tabled the bill. He alleged that Waqf bill is a deliberate effort to dilute the Constitution.He accused Rijiju of misleading the House while referencing the UPA government’s actions in 2013 during his speech.""This bill is not just about administrative changes; it is a deliberate effort to dilute the Constitution, defame minority communities, divide Indian society, and ultimately disenfranchise minorities,"" Gogoi said.""Did the Minority Affairs Ministry make this bill, or did some other department make it? Where did this Bill come from?... Today, the condition of minorities in the country has become such that today, the government will have to give a certificate of their religion... Will they ask for a certificate from other religions whether you have completed five years or not? Why is this being asked in this bill? Why is the government interfering in this matter of religion,"" Gogoi asked.BJP MP Prasad described the Waqf as merely a statutory body and questioned its contributions to public welfare.""The Waqf Board is simply a statutory entity. How many schools and hospitals have been built on its properties?"" he asked, challenging its role in serving the community.Samajwadi Party chief and MP Akhilesh Yadav, during his argument over the Waqf bill, took a jibe at BJP that triggered a political tussle with a tinge of humor. He said, ""The party that calls itself the world's largest party has not yet been able to choose its national president.""Replying to him, Union minister Amit Shah sarcastically said, ""All the parties in front of me, their national president, will be chosen by only some family members. We have to choose from 12-13 crore members after a process. So it takes time. In your case, it will not take much time. I am saying that you will remain president for 25 years.""He alleged that the controversial Waqf (Amendment) Bill was introduced by BJP to divert attention from the failures of the current government.""This Bill has been brought not for reforms, but to cover up the shortcomings and failures of this regime,"" he said accusing BJP of using legislation as a political tool.","Waqf Amendment Bill tabled in Lok Sabha amid opposition.
