"Traffic violation may earn negative points, lead to DL suspension & cancellation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/traffic-violation-may-earn-negative-points-lead-to-dl-suspension-cancellation/articleshow/120840849.cms,"Representational Image

NEW DELHI: Aiming to rein in errant drivers and repeat offenders, the road transport ministry is planning to introduce a negative points system on driving licences (DLs) for offences such as jumping signals and speeding. Once the accumulated negative points cross the defined threshold, the DL can be suspended or cancelled. These negative points would be in addition to existing fines and penalties.The ministry shared the overall framework of the proposal, as a part of overhauling the DL regime, at a brainstorming session on road safety with stakeholders, including state govt representatives, experts and non-govt organisations this week.Countries such as Australia, UK, Germany, Brazil, France and Canada use a point system to track and penalise repeat offenders.Officials said the “demerit and merit” point licencing system will be included in the Motor Vehicles Act when it seeks amendments to the law in the next couple of months. “While demerit points will be assigned for violation of traffic rules, merit points would be rewarded for good driver behaviour and to good samaritans,” said an official.Increase in fines and penalties introduced since 2019 has not brought the desired results as road deaths and injuries have increased to more than 1.7 lakh in a year. Sources said the extended penalty which can result in suspension or cancellation of DLs would be a bigger deterrent going by the global experience. They added that with the increased electronic recording of offences now the enforcement agencies concerned can track the penalty points using handheld devices for taking immediate action.In 2011, an expert committee on “Review of MV Act” headed by former road transport secretary S Sunder had recommended the “penalty point system for drivers” with details of such points for every offence. It had recommended suspension of DLs for one year, if the total number of accumulated points crossed 12 in three years. If a driver whose licence has been suspended, again accumulated 12 points, his DL would be cancelled for five years.The govt’s plan also includes mandatory driving test for DL holders applying for renewal before expiry of existing licence, if they have violated traffic rules. At present, driving test is exempted if one applies for DL renewal before its expiry. “The moves are aimed at enhancing overall road safety,” said another official.The ministry will also make mandatory provision of obtaining learners licence for electric vehicles of less than 1,500 watts and maximum design speed of 25 kmph. It will introduce graded eligibility for obtaining learners’ licences.","The road transport ministry is planning to introduce a negative points system on driving licences (DLs) for offences such as jumping signals and speeding.

Rs 2 bribe leads to SC ruling - Stamp vendors are public servants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2-bribe-leads-to-sc-ruling-stamp-vendors-are-public-servants/articleshow/120840706.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: Conviction of a stamp vendor under Prevention of Corruption Act for charging Rs 2 extra for a Rs 10 stamp paper in Dec 2003 kept the three-tier judiciary engaged for almost 22 years to find answer to the question - Is a stamp vendor a public servant and is he liable under anti-corruption law ?Two constitutional courts – the Delhi HC and the Supreme Court – cumulatively deliberated for 16 years and on Friday, the SC ruled that stamp vendors are public servants, which will bring lakhs of them in states within the ambit of PC Act. But the stamp vendor who sparked the debate, was acquitted by SC after two decades.The incident happened at the Sub-Registrar’s office at Janakpuri on Dec 9, 2003, when a stamp vendor demanded Rs 12 for selling a Rs 10 stamp paper and on exchange of chemical-laced currency notes, he was caught by anti-corruption bureau and proceeded under PC Act on charges of corruption.The trial court convicted him under PC Act in 2008, termed him to be a public servant and sentenced him to one year imprisonment with a fine of Rs 1000. The Delhi HC took six years to decide the issue - Whether a stamp vendor is a public servant for the purposes of the PC Act? – and penned a lengthy judgment to concur with the trial court.The appeal by the convicted stamp vendor remained pending with the SC for 11 years. On Friday a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan acquitted him for lack of evidence and overturned concurrent finding of guilt by the trial court and the HC.In a 45-page judgment, the SC ruled that “stamp vendors across the country, by virtue of performing an important public duty and receiving remuneration from the Government for the discharge of such duty, are undoubtedly public servants within the ambit of Section 2(c)(i) of the PC Act.”Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala said as the legislature has given a wide and comprehensive definition of ‘public servant’ to curb the menace of corruption, “It is the nature of duty being discharged by a person which assumes paramount importance when determining whether such a person falls within the ambit of the definition of public servant as defined under the PC Act.”The bench said since the licence to become a stamp vendor is issued by the govt and is entitled to receive a discount on the stamp paper he sells, he would certainly be treated as a person ‘remunerated by the govt’ for the purpose of PC Act.","The incident happened at the Sub-Registrar’s office at Janakpuri on Dec 9, 2003.

""Capable of automatic take-off and landing, HAPS aircraft do not require launch vehicles or rockets like satellites. They can be deployed from different locations as well as repaired and maintained easily as compared to satellites,"" the officer said.While the armed forces are also pursuing the case for launch-on-demand satellites, IAF wants HAPS aircraft to have a minimum operational endurance of 48 hours with data links and telemetry range of at least 150 km in a ""line of sight"" environment.""The desirable Satcom (satellite communication) is at least 400 km,"" the RFI said. With a detection range of at least 50 km from the operating altitude, the aircraft should be compatible with electro-optical and infrared cameras as well as electronic and communication intelligence payloads. They should be capable of effectively operating even during night and low-visibility conditions. ""The complete delivery is expected to be completed in 18 months from the date of the contract,"" the RFI said.IAF is parallelly pursuing a case for three ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance) aircraft to provide accurate ""actionable intelligence"" acquired through synthetic aperture radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors.Under the much-touted Defence Technology and Trade Initiative between India and the US, which has largely failed to deliver till now, ISTAR platforms were among the different projects identified for co-development and co-production.","IAF wants to acquire three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft.

She was saved at the last moment.”The newlyweds were just about settling in when the April 22 Pakistan-backed terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam tore their lives asunder along with those of many others.Lawyer Sharma cited a clarification from MHA that the order cancelling visas to Pakistanis wasn’t applicable to diplomatic and long-term visas.“Meenal was interviewed and recommended a long-term visa before the deportation exercise triggered by the Pahalgam attack started,” he said.On whether a Islamic marriage solemnised online by a qazi was legally valid, the lawyer said the Union govt recognised the wedding by issuing a visa to Meenal “as the wife of Munir Khan”.While the high court didn’t stay Meenal’s deportation, it said she should be allowed to stay in Jammu until her visa status was clear. The case will be next heard on May 14.The court said the onus was on the Union govt to decide whether a long-term visa should be issued to Munir’s wife, also noting that her short-term visa had lapsed more than a month ago.","Pakistan national Meenal Ahmed Khan was reunited with her husband, CRPF trooper Munir Khan, on J&K high court’s orders this week.

India's 1st transshipment hub inaugurated by PM in Kerala,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-1st-transshipment-hub-inaugurated-by-pm-in-kerala/articleshow/120834462.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that the capacity of the Vizhinjam deepwater port will triple in three years, allowing some of the world's largest cargo ships to dock here smoothly.PM said the port will reduce India's reliance on foreign transshipment hubs where 75% of its transshipments currently happen, in what was an obvious reference to Colombo and Singapore. He added that this shift could boost revenue retention and create new opportunities in Kerala.The Rs 8,800 crore Vizhinjam project is India's first dedicated transshipment hub with its natural depth of nearly 20 metres allowing large ships to berth, something that is not possible at the smaller ports in the country.Modi linked the project to India's broader maritime strategy, referring to Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision and India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor announced at the G20 summit. While the port itself was under development for years, much of the construction and equipment involved private sector collaboration, particularly Adani Ports , which is operating the terminal.In a lighter vein, PM also commented on the role of private investment in the project. ""When the people of Gujarat learn that Adani built such a great port in Kerala, after working on a port in Gujarat for 30 years without building anything like this, they'll be upset with him,"" he said, drawing laughter from the audience.Highlighting govt's focus on maritime development in past 10 years, Modi mentioned about the 30% reduction in turnaround time of ships at India's major ports. He also said the reformed regulations concerning Indian seafarers, was yielding significant results. While in 2014, the number of Indian seafarers was little over 1.2 lakh, today this has surged beyond 3.2 lakh.The event, held on the birth anniversary of Adi Shankaracharya - a figure Modi often mentioned - highlighted Kerala's growing importance in India's economic and maritime plans. Modi linked the port's opening to the spiritual legacy of the Kerala-born philosopher, saying his teachings laid the foundation for unity and that Kerala is now being positioned as a key part of India's economic future.The port was inaugurated at a time when Kerala's economy faces rising debt and limited fiscal space, with the state govt seeking more central assistance. The PM highlighted several infrastructure projects the Centre has supported in the state, including the long-delayed Kollam and Alappuzha bypasses, as well as new investments like the Kochi shipbuilding and repair cluster.","The Rs 8,800 crore Vizhinjam project is India's first dedicated transshipment hub with its natural depth of nearly 20 metres.

Court nixes complaint against Gulmarg fashion show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-nixes-complaint-against-gulmarg-fashion-show/articleshow/120833561.cms,"Elle India

SRINAGAR: A Srinagar court has dismissed a case of obscenity and hurting religious sentiments against designers Shivan and Narresh and unidentified models over a fashion show held on ski resort Gulmarg’s snowy slopes this March.The court observed that the complaint, which included two screenshots showing one male and one female model in skimpy clothing, did not meet the legal standard for the offence of obscenity “in the broader scheme of the event”. The March 7 fashion show, during the holy month of Ramadan, had stirred a row and a political storm in Muslim-majority J&K, with chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq leading the offensive.“The complainant has affixed two screenshots showing one female and one male model in skimpy clothes. That is the sole fact appearing in the complaint alleged to be obscene. Accused on the other hand has placed on record material which show that in the fashion show several models participated, and the two models wearing skimpy clothes actually were showcasing swim wear for which the company of first accused has expertise,” special court judge Faizan Nazar held in his order on Thursday.Adil Ahmad Khan, a civilian, had filed the complaint, also naming the editor-in-chief ofmagazine, which ran Instagram reels from the show.The judge also dismissed claims of “outraging religious feelings”, observing that no court could take cognisance of a complaint filed by a private person in an offence under Section 299 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) (which prohibits insulting religious beliefs) without the prior sanction of the central or state govt.Mirwaiz had slammed the event as “outrageous” and “obscene.” Governing National Conference (NC) MP and Shia cleric Aga Ruhullah Mehdi called the show “shocking”. BJP’s J&K president Sunil Sharma blamed chief minister Omar Abdullah, saying the models and designers stayed at Nedous Hotel, owned by the CM’s relatives.Omar had acknowledged the hotel belonged to his relatives but denied any involvement with the show. Designer duo Shivan and Narresh issued an apology on March 9, saying their sole intention was to “celebrate creativity without any desire to offend anyone or religious sentiments”. Elle India responded by deleting the 0.35-second Instagram. reel.Despite the apologies, Khan filed the court complaint, saying he was “deeply hurt”. The fashion show, including its attire, choreography and behaviour of the participants were obscene and offensive, with its contents explicitly sexualised and disrespectful to the religious and cultural sensibilities of Muslims and Kashmiri culture in the holy month of Ramadan, Khan argued.Khan had also alleged offences under J&K Excise Act, 1958, which proscribes drinking in public or places of worship. The judge rejected this charge, saying the law barred taking cognisance of private complaints. The court further pointed out that Nedous Hotel had a four-hour permit for serving liquor on the day of the show.","A Srinagar court has dismissed a case of obscenity and hurting religious sentiments against designers Shivan and Narresh and unidentified models.

Court issues notice to Sonia Gandhi and Rahul in National Herald case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-issues-notice-to-sonia-gandhi-and-rahul-in-national-herald-case/articleshow/120835110.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court issued a notice on Friday to Congress functionaries Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and others in a money-laundering case related to the National Herald newspaper. The court observed that the right to be heard at any stage of proceedings breathes life into the right to a fair trial.The court of special judge Vishal Gogne was hearing arguments on whether a notice is required to be issued to the accused in view of the proviso to BNSS Section 223. ""The right of the accused to be heard at the cognisance stage must be liberally applied to proceedings under PMLA before the special court as a continuation of the recent jurisprudence on PMLA, which has read the constitutional mandate and rights into PMLA,"" the judge said.The case is at the stage of consideration regarding notice. On April 25, additional solicitor general SV Raju, appearing for ED, submitted that under the new legal provisions cognisance of the chargesheet cannot be taken without first hearing the accused. On April 9, ED filed a chargesheet before the court that mentions Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as accused numbers 1 and 2 under Secs 3 and 4 (which deal with money-laundering and its punishment) and Sec 70 (offences by companies) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act . The charges, if proved, attract a maximum imprisonment of seven years.The chargesheet names seven accused - five individuals and two private companies - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda, Sunil Bhandari, Young Indian, and Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd. On Friday, during the hearing, the ASG submitted before the court that in an ED case where notice was not issued, it was taken to the Supreme Court and SC had stayed the proceedings.The judge, taking note that the proviso to BNSS Sec 223 is a salutary provision in furtherance of the right to be heard as part of a fair trial, said, ""It is designed to protect accused persons against improper implication by permitting them to make submissions prior to the court taking cognisance of the offences in question. The BNSS is therefore a progressive legislation in this regard and records among its objectives and reasons a 'citizens-centric criminal procedure' as the 'need of the hour'.""This benevolent intent of BNSS should be read in favour of the accused rather than the investigation agencies when a right to be heard is to be accorded at any stage of the proceedings, the judge said. The court said it does not come to any ""detriment"" if the accused is permitted to make submissions on the question of cognisance. ""In this adherence to the principles of fair hearing, the right to be heard is not inconsistent with any of the powers vested in the ED for investigation or the presumptions as well as the burden of proof stipulated under the PMLA,"" said the court.The court also noted the submissions of the ASG that ED is not opposing such a notice precisely because it is a votary of a fair trial. The court listed various reasons for issuing notice, including that the proviso to BNSS Sec 223 creates a sui generis right of the accused to be heard at the cognisance stage and is not inconsistent with the complaint procedure or other provisions under PMLA.""Such a right does not defeat or diminish the operation of any provision of PMLA. The proviso to BNSS Sec 223... is required to be read in favour of the proposed accused persons,"" the court said.","Delhi court issues a notice to Congress functionaries Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and others in a money-laundering case related to the National Herald newspaper. The court observed that the right to be heard at any stage of proceedings breathes life into right to a fair trial.

While PM Narendra Modi formally dedicated the port to the nation, Vijayan, who delivered the presidential address at the inaugural event, chose to spotlight LDF govt's central role in conceptualising and executing the project, and avoided any mention of former CM Oommen Chandy , under whose leadership the crucial contract with the Adani Group was signed.In what many view as a calculated omission, the CM refrained from acknowledging Chandy's controversial, yet decisive 2015 move to sign the agreement with Adani Ports - a move then fiercely opposed by LDF, which even instituted a judicial probe into the deal after coming to power. Instead, Vijayan highlighted the legacy of the 1996 LDF govt for originally envisioning the port, and credited the current administration for executing it against all odds.Vijayan stressed that Vizhinjam is the first large port in India to be developed under the leadership of a state govt, with Kerala bearing over 60% of the Rs 8,686cr project cost.He said that although the agreement originally scheduled the project completion by 2045, LDF govt ensured that commercial operations began in 2024.

SC urges law minister to make changes in arbitration bill yet to be taken up by Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-urges-law-minister-to-make-changes-in-arbitration-bill-yet-to-be-taken-up-by-parliament/articleshow/120834244.cms,"‘Even after 30 yrs, procedural issues dog arbitration regime’



NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented step, Supreme Court appears to have vetted a bill pending consideration in Parliament. On Friday, it ""urged"" the law ministry to take a ""serious look"" and make changes in it, keeping in mind the arbitration regime in India.Constitutional courts are empowered to test the validity of laws enacted by Parliament and state legislatures and interpret the law. The Constitution under Article 141 provides that a law declared valid by the SC shall be binding on all courts. But these courts have never entertained a petition challenging the validity of a bill.Though the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, proposing major changes in the 1996 law on the same subject, was not under challenge before SC, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan decided to scrutinise it. They concluded that the bill suffered procedural lacunae and vacuum similar to the 1996 Act.The bench’s comments came in a case involving arbitration between two parties.Giving a brief background of arbitration laws in India, starting with the 1940 Act, followed by the 1996 Act and the changes proposed to be effected through the 2024 bill, the bench said, “It has been almost 30 years since the 1996 Act has remained in force. Various amendments to the 1996 Act have been made over the years to ensure that arbitration proceedings are conducted and concluded expeditiously. It is indeed very sad to note that even after these many years, procedural issues such as the one involved in the case at hand, have continued to plague the arbitration regime of India.”Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala said, “Unfortunately, even the new bill has taken no steps whatsoever for ameliorating the position of law as regards the power of impleadment or joinder of an arbitral tribunal. What is expressly missing in the 1996 Act is still missing in the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, despite a catena of decisions of this court as well as various high courts, highlighting the need for statutory recognition of such power in order to obviate all possibilities of confusion.”He further said, “We urge the department of legal affairs, ministry of law and justice, to take a serious look at the arbitration regime that is prevailing in India and bring about necessary changes while the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, is still being considered.”The same bench had raised eyebrows in political and legal circles with its verdict setting a deadline of three months for the President to give assent to bills sent to her by governors, and by suggesting that she might consider it prudent to take the opinion of the apex court to determine the validity of bills.","Supreme Court appears to have vetted a bill pending consideration in Parliament.

NEW DELHI: A man hailing from Mirpur in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) moved to Srinagar on a Pakistani passport in 1997 and brought along his family of five three years later.

After they moved to J&K, all members of the family had acquired Indian passports and Aadhaar cards.Members of the family came to J&K in 2000 and the children got enrolled in a private school in Srinagar and “have developed deep-rooted social, familial and economic relationship with India”, the petitioner said and termed as arbitrary the deportation order issued to them on April 29 as part of the decision to extern Pakistanis in the aftermath of killing of tourists in Pahalgam.Butt’s counsel Nanda Kishore told the bench that the entire family, barring two Bengaluru-based sons, one of whom is the petitioner, were arrested and taken to the Attari-Wagah border for deportation. While asking the petitioner to move the authorities concerned, the court told govt not to take any coercive step till the scrutiny was completed. If the grievance persisted after verification, he could approach J&K HC, the bench told the petitioner. At the request of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, the bench said this “no coercive step” order would not be treated as a precedent by courts.The petitioner’s father, born in Muzaffarabad in 1952, was a journalist, and after moving to Srinagar in 1997, continued with his profession and acquired properties in the city.

Introducing Jordon Hudson's ex-boyfriend Joshua L. Zuckerman: The 64-year-old businessman who dated her before Bill Belichick

Love Beyond Age: Navigating Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson's May-December Relationship

“wise beyond her years,”

Joshua L. Zuckerman’s perspective on Jordon Hudson’s current relationship with Bill Belichick

Jordon Hudson ’s relationship with Bill Belichick is currently under intense scrutiny, as the media has been all over their 48-year age gap. From accusations of gold-digging to endless gossip about their unusual romance, Hudson can't seem to catch a break. But while the public focuses on her relationship with the 72-year-old NFL legend, there's an unexpected voice coming to her defense: her 64-year-old ex-boyfriend, Joshua L. Zuckerman . Zuckerman, who dated Hudson for several years before she began her relationship with Belichick, has a lot to say about her character and motivations. And he might just provide some insight into why Hudson tends to choose older men.Since news of Hudson's romance with Belichick became public, the media has been relentless, scrutinizing their every move and fueling online debates. Critics have rushed to label Hudson as a “gold-digger” due to the age difference, with many assuming her relationship is about the financial benefits of being with someone of Belichick’s stature. Social media users have dissected everything from her motives to her past, while tabloids continue to spin headlines questioning whether love or ambition is truly driving this unexpected romance.While the media continues to pile on, Hudson’s ex-boyfriend, Joshua L. Zuckerman, is speaking out in her defense. Zuckerman, a 64-year-old businessman, dated Hudson before she became involved with Belichick. Despite their breakup, Zuckerman has maintained a positive relationship with Hudson and he has his own perspective on the criticism she’s facing. In an interview, he described Hudson asand he insists that the narrative surrounding her character is entirely unfair. For him, Hudson isn’t the “gold-digger” the media makes her out to be but rather a deep, intellectual young woman who deserves respect.Zuckerman paints a picture of Hudson as someone who doesn’t fit the typical mold of a young woman seeking financial gain from an older man. Instead, he talks about the deep intellectual bond they shared during their relationship. According to him, the two connected over psychology, philosophy, and nature, topics that aren’t usually the center of a traditional relationship with someone much older. For Zuckerman, this was never about money, it was about a shared mental connection. His defense emphasizes that Hudson is much more than what critics make her out to be, suggesting that her choices in men have always been based on shared values rather than material gain.Despite their breakup, Zuckerman remains a supporter of Hudson’s and doesn’t want the public’s perception to define her. He believes that Hudson’s current relationship with Belichick, and her past relationship with him, were built on genuine connections, not financial motives. For Zuckerman, Hudson is a young woman unafraid to live life on her own terms and he hopes that the media will start to understand that her dating habits don’t fit the narrative they’ve been pushing.Also read - Bill Belichick’s girlfriend Jordon Hudson gets slammed by his daughter-in-law after Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman defend her","Jordon Hudson’s relationship with Bill Belichick is currently under intense scrutiny, as the media has been all over their 48-year age gap.

Punishment for Ashley Buchanan: More than just firing

Who is Chandra Holt

What Kohl told staff on Ashley Buchanan's sacking

Retail chain Kohl has reportedly fired its newly hired chief executive officer (CEO) after an investigation showed he had cut a “highly unusual"" business deal with a woman who had been his romantic partner. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Ashley Buchanan directed Kohl’s to “engage in vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest”. Kohl had hired Ashley Buchanan to lead the department store chain in November 2024.Specifically, the conflict involved Buchanan’s relationship with Chandra Holt, a former colleague at Walmart. According to a company filing that didn’t specifically name Holt, the vendor signed a multimillion-dollar consulting agreement with Kohl’s with unusually favorable terms. Kohl’s audit committee oversaw an investigation that found Buchanan had not disclosed the inappropriate vendor relationships.According to the WSJ report, Buchanan and Holt rose through the ranks at Walmart before leaving around the same time for senior positions at other retailers.Buchanan has not only lost his CEO job, he will also have to forfeit all equity awards from the company and be required to reimburse Kohl’s on a pro-rated basis for a signing award worth $2.5 million, according to securities filings.Chandra Holt is the founder and current CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand infused with vitamins and minerals. As per her LinkedIn profile, she left Walmart in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus. In 2023, Holt became CEO of Beyond Inc. — the company that owns Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond — where she led the company for a year.Kohl’s named board member Michael Bender as interim CEO effective immediately. In an all-hands meeting on May 1, Bender and other Kohl’s executives “sought to reassure staffers,” but didn’t provide any additional details or take questions, the Journal reported.“This is not a moment we expected nor the outcome we wanted for the company and our associates, but it is the right decision for us,” Bender said, according to a recording reviewed by the Journal.","Kohl's fired CEO Ashley Buchanan after discovering a conflict of interest involving a business deal with Chandra Holt.

“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier. The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.”

""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,""

""These actions will enable us to expand our US Domestic operating margin and increase profitability.”

“Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business,”

“Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision.”

United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June. This move comes after the biggest package delivery company in the world decided to sharply cut back on the shipments from its largest customer, Amazon . The company announced that it expects the job cuts to take place this year and the facility closures, across both leased and owned sites, by June 30. UPS is still reviewing its network and may identify additional locations for shutdown. As per FactSet data, the company employs about 490,000 workers. The upcoming job cuts will reduce UPS’ workforce by slightly over 4%. This decision follows the company's announcement to cut 12,000 positions last year.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, a UPS spokesman said the job cuts reflect a 50% reduction in shipping volume from Amazon, its largest customer, combined with broader cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives as part of a major operational restructuring.On the other hand, union's general president Sean O'Brien told Reuters, ""UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 jobs under its current national master agreement with Teamsters. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.""In its recent regulatory filing, the company said that cuts are in ""connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.”UPS CEO Carol Tome said:This decision follows a slowdown in economic growth and mounting recession fears driven by Trump’s aggressive trade policies.Tome noted during the company's latest earnings call.UPS CFO Brian Dykes added:In January, UPS agreed with Amazon to reduce the volume it handles by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. Speaking on the fourth-quarter earnings call, Tome noted that after nearly 30 years of partnership, the renewal of Amazon’s contract this year prompted a reassessment of the relationship.Tomé said at the time.Meanwhile, an Amazon spokesperson said to Reuters:In related news,","United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June. This move comes after the biggest package delivery company in the world decided to sharply cut back on the shipments from its largest customer, Amazon.

Elon Musk says DOGE is a way of life

Late night ice creams at White House



Elon Musk plans to keep his ‘tiny office’ in White House

Elon Musk on if DOGE has been effective

Elon Musk says he didn’t always like the job

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), a federal initiative aimed at reducing government spending and modernizing technology systems. Musk, who was serving as a special government employee, is transitioning from daily in-person engagements at the White House to remote participation. In an hour-long interview on Wednesday April 30, Musk told reporters “Now we’re getting more of a rhythm. And so the amount of time that it’s necessary for me to spend here is much less, and I can return to primarily running my companies, which do need me.”During the interview, Musk insisted that the transition does not mean that DOGE work is done. The task force which was originally set up to terminate on July 4, 2026, will reportedly continue till the end of 2028. Asked about the possibility of extending DOGE's mandate, Musk responded, ""I think so,"" adding, ""It's up to the president.”The Tesla CEO also compared DOGE to Buddhism, stating “It’s a way of life, like Buddhism”. When asked who will lead DOGE, Musk stated “You wouldn’t ask who would lead Buddhism.”Stating that during the “intense” three months of the Trump administration, he occasionally slept over at the White House at Trump’s invitation. Musk has frequently traveled with Trump in recent months. Sharing an exchange after such travels, Musk said: “He (Donald Trump) was like: 'Where are you staying?' I was like: 'I don't know. At a friend's house, I guess.' And then he was like: 'Why don't you stay here?' I was like: 'Sure.'”He would stay over in the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom where he occasionally played video games – Diablo and Path of Exile.Musk, during the interview, recalled that Trump once called him late at night and suggested he get ice cream from the White House kitchen. “He’ll actually call late at night and say, ‘Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,’” Musk said, jokingly adding “Don’t tell RFK.”During his tenure at White House, Musk told reporters that he was assigned an office on the top floor of the West Wing. Stating that he intends to keep the “comically tiny office”, he added that it's a tight space and gets only a ""glimmer of sunlight.""“It has a view of nothing,” he said. “It has a window but all you see is the HVAC unit, which is fine. It makes it harder to shoot me, I guess. There's not a good line of sight.”During the interview, Musk told the reporters that DOGE has cut $160 billion in federal spending which is far short of the $2 trillion goal he set last year. He said “In the grand scheme of things, I think we've been effective. Not as effective as I like ... but we've made progress.”He further added: “There's a long way to go. It's pretty difficult ... It's like: How much pain is the Cabinet and Congress willing to take? It can be done. But it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.”Musk also talked about the backlash DOGE faced for its actions and how his companies, especially Tesla became a target of protests and vandalism. He said “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun” adding ""Seeing cars on fire is not fun.""","Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency.

Planning to travel outside US? What every green card holder should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/planning-to-travel-outside-us-what-every-green-card-holder-should-know/articleshow/120822755.cms,"Green Card holders: The basics

Green card holders' rights

Travel restrictions and risks for Green Card holders

Traveling for extended periods : Green card holders can leave the US for up to 365 days without jeopardizing their residency. However, spending more than six months abroad can raise suspicion among Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, who may question whether the individual still considers the US their primary residence. Furthermore, being outside the US for more than six months can reset the timeline for citizenship eligibility.

Furthermore, being outside the US for more than six months can reset the timeline for citizenship eligibility. Criminal convictions : Any crime, from minor offenses like speeding to more serious violations, can lead to denial of entry or even deportation. Green card holders who have committed criminal offenses may face particularly stringent questioning when re-entering the country. Immigration experts say that although green card holders can be scrutinized more closely, they are typically not targeted unless their offenses are substantial.

Green card holders who have committed criminal offenses may face particularly stringent questioning when re-entering the country. Immigration experts say that although green card holders can be scrutinized more closely, they are typically not targeted unless their offenses are substantial. Abandonment of status: In recent years, some green card holders returning from extended trips abroad have been pressured by CBP agents to abandon their legal permanent resident status. Some have been presented with forms to voluntarily surrender their green cards. Legal experts like immigration attorney Brad Bernstein note that CBP is increasingly treating green card holders with the same scrutiny applied to tourists or students.





Real-life examples of scrutiny

The Trump administration’s impact on immigration

Precautions green card holders should take before traveling

Apply for a re-entry permit : For those planning to be outside the US for six months or longer, immigration lawyer Michael Wildes advises applying for a re-entry permit. This permit, which allows re-entry after up to two years abroad, serves as proof that the green card holder does not intend to abandon their legal status. It’s also advisable to carry the receipt for the application if the permit has not arrived before departure.

This permit, which allows re-entry after up to two years abroad, serves as proof that the green card holder does not intend to abandon their legal status. It’s also advisable to carry the receipt for the application if the permit has not arrived before departure. Consider global entry : Green card holders who travel frequently may want to apply for Global Entry, a program offered by CBP that expedites the clearance process for re-entering the US. This program can significantly reduce the time spent at border checkpoints and may help minimize scrutiny when traveling internationally.



The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has left many green card holders uneasy about the security of their legal status—particularly when travelling abroad. According to The New York Times, growing concerns stem from increased scrutiny at airports and border crossings, where even lawful permanent residents are facing questioning, detentions, or in rare cases, pressure to relinquish their status. With immigration laws tightening and enforcement becoming more aggressive, green card holders must exercise caution when planning international trips.A green card, or Permanent Resident Card , allows its holder to live and work permanently in the United States. Traditionally, green card holders could travel in and out of the US without the same concerns faced by other foreign nationals. However, recent changes in border enforcement have shifted this dynamic. Green card holders are no longer immune to the intense scrutiny at US ports of entry, particularly if they have committed crimes, no matter how minor.Green card holders enjoy several privileges, such as eligibility for Social Security, Medicare, college financial aid, and military service. They can also apply for US citizenship after five years of residency (three years if married to a US citizen). However, to maintain eligibility for citizenship, they must spend a minimum of 913 days in the US within that five-year period.As of January 2024, there were 12.8 million green card holders living in the US, according to the Department of Homeland Security.While green card holders have the right to travel outside the US, certain restrictions apply:One case highlighted by Bernstein involved a green card holder detained after returning from a three-month business trip in Jamaica. The individual, a New York resident, was asked whether he truly lived in the US and was pressured to surrender his green card. He refused and was eventually allowed to re-enter the country. He described the experience as ""disheartening,"" saying it felt as though he wasn’t welcome anymore.Green card holders are increasingly facing difficulties at US entry points. Cliona Ward, a 54-year-old resident of Santa Cruz, California, was detained at San Francisco International Airport in April 2024 after a brief trip to Dublin. Ward, who has lived in the US since she was 12, had two felony convictions related to drug possession in 2007 and 2008. Although the convictions were expunged after she completed rehabilitation, Ward was detained for over a week, despite maintaining sobriety for almost two decades. Immigration authorities have not provided records of her case, and her lawyer has yet to receive an official hearing date.The Trump administration’s stance on immigration has led to stricter enforcement at border checkpoints, as well as heightened vetting of foreign nationals, including green card holders. Some of the policies implemented by the administration include social media screenings for evidence of antisemitism, which could affect green card holders and immigrants applying for visas. These heightened security measures, part of the “advanced vetting” process, have drawn backlash from allied countries such as Germany, which has updated travel advisories for its citizens traveling to the US.Immigration lawyers recommend that green card holders take several steps to safeguard their residency status before traveling abroad:Green card holders should be aware of the shifting immigration landscape and take proactive steps to ensure their status remains secure while traveling outside the US. With increased scrutiny at borders and potential pressure to abandon residency, it’s critical to understand both the risks and precautions associated with international travel. By staying informed and following legal advice, green card holders can navigate these challenges and continue to enjoy the benefits of permanent residency in the United States.","Green card holders can leave the US for up to 365 days without jeopardizing their residency.

In a rare occurrence, an IndiGo aircraft winging its way from Jaipur to Chandigarh Friday morning saw each of its two engines flame out momentarily one by one. First one engine of the ATR aircraft had a flameout for a few seconds and then its auto ignition brought it back to life almost immediately. Then the second engine had the exact same occurrence. The aircraft landed safely in Chandigarh and is grounded there for engines inspection.The Directorate Genera of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has sought a report from the airline, said a senior regulatory official. “This happened during very heavy rain that had lashed the region on Friday morning. The first engine recovered and restarted after a momentary flame out. Then some time later, the same thing happened with the second engine. Luckily both the engines did not flameout simultaneously.”Airline sources say: “The aircraft landed safely in Chandigarh. It is now grounded for inspection. What had seemingly happened was that the engine performance due to weather-related issues dropped in terms of parameters like RPM. The engine showed a reduction in propeller speed (the combustion that drives the engine ‘flames out’). The engine control systems detected and corrected the issue. Passengers did not feel anything unusual. The matter has been reported to the engine manufacturer and the DGCA.”",The ATR aircraft landed safely in Chandigarh and is grounded there for engines inspection.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

Non-chinese products bolster Amazon's position



Amazon CEO Andy Jassy revealed Thursday that President Trump 's China tariffs may actually strengthen Amazon's position in the retail market while putting traditional retailers at a disadvantage.""Retailers who aren't buying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, marking these items up, rebranding and selling to U.S. consumers,"" Jassy told analysts following the company's strong first-quarter earnings announcement.The Amazon chief explained that middle-man costs create a tariff disparity that favors Chinese merchants selling directly through Amazon's marketplace.""These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to U.S. consumers in our marketplace. So, the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China direct sellers,"" Jassy noted.While some sellers may raise prices to offset tariff costs, Amazon's vast marketplace of 2 million independent merchants means others will likely view it as an opportunity to capture market share by absorbing the costs.""I think when you've got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers deciding that they're going to capture [market] share, and they're not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to customers,"" Jassy said.Beyond imported goods, Jassy highlighted Amazon's strength in consumer packaged goods, which are largely produced outside China and less affected by the tariffs.""Even if you exclude Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, Amazon is one of the largest grocers in the U.S. with over $100 billion in gross sales last year,"" he said.With Amazon generating more than $150 billion in revenue from seller fees in 2024 alone, the e-commerce giant appears positioned to weather and potentially benefit from market disruptions that could devastate traditional retailers dependent on complex supply chains involving Chinese goods.",China tariffs may actually strengthen Amazon's position in the retail market.

'Refreshing and exciting'

Crowds at opposition rallies

Singapore, May 03, 2025 -Singaporeans cast their votes Saturday in an election where Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition in uncertain economic times for the trade-centred nation.Wong's ruling People's Action Party (PAP), which has steered the island to prosperity while using an iron hand to suppress dissent, is expected to easily retain a clear majority in parliament.Popular after leading Singapore's Covid task force, Wong took over last year from his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew who ruled the island state after its bitter break-up with Malaysia in 1965.Wong has repeatedly said he needed a strong mandate to navigate heavily trade-reliant Singapore through economic uncertainty in light of tariffs levied by US President Donald Trump.He has warned Singapore would be hit hard if Trump went ahead with the tariffs he announced and then paused for most countries, except China, and needed to stay open and competitive to counter their effects.""So I say to all Singaporeans, please consider carefully. This is not a gamble. This is your family, your future, our Singapore,"" he said during the campaign.Political analyst Nydia Ngiow said the PAP had long been seen as Singapore's steady hand in crises but that the recent tariff turmoil may not be a big factor for voters yet.""Given that general elections in Singapore tend to focus on local issues, it is unlikely that geopolitics will shape voters' decisions -- unless Singaporeans feel a direct and tangible impact on their cost of living, job security or the broader economy,"" she told AFP.Muhammad Nazri bin Hadri, a 25-year-old voter, said he was finding it ""very difficult"" to buy a house.""I hope there are some changes to (public housing) rules,"" he told AFP after casting his ballot.The overwhelming PAP majority in Singapore's unicameral legislature is such a norm in the wealthy island's political landscape that the opposition and its supporters will consider a few more seats gained as a significant victory, observers said.But the PAP's dominance is increasingly being challenged by a more vocal electorate, especially among younger voters who appear open to alternative political voices.""Young voters will be a factor in some wards. Unlike the older voters they are prepared to listen to both sides and make an informed decision,"" said veteran former news editor and political observer P.N. Balji.One voter told AFP she had been impressed by ""refreshing and exciting"" new candidates from across the political spectrum.""Whether or not they get elected, I hope we see and hear more of them, and get to know them better,"" said 40-year-old Shi'ai Liang.In 2020, the country's largest opposition group, the Workers' Party (WP), made historic gains, winning 10 of the 93 seats at stake -- a significant jump from its previously held four seats.The WP -- which has become politically slicker -- is hoping to build on that momentum with a slate of charismatic candidates, including a top lawyer.The party pulled in massive crowds at its rallies during the campaign, just like in previous elections, but those big numbers have seldom translated into electoral wins in the past.WP candidates have lambasted the government for raising a goods and services tax amid rising inflation and insist the government has not done enough to curb rising costs in one of the most expensive countries in the world.They also say more opposition MPs are needed in parliament so that the PAP does not have a ""blank cheque"" and can be held accountable.The PAP, however, points to the billions of Singapore dollars it has spent in helping citizens cope with rising costs, including via cash handouts and grocery vouchers.Singapore has around 2.75 million eligible voters who will elect 97 members of parliament.Polls opened at 8:00 am (0000 GMT) for 12 hours of voting, with some results expected to stream in around midnight.",Singaporeans cast their votes Saturday in an election where Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
