NEW DELHI: The seriousness of a Bandra courtroom gave way to chaos on Sunday as two lawyers scrambled to represent the man accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan. The scene unfolded during the remand proceedings of Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad , a 30-year-old Bangladeshi national arrested for the attack. The magistrate, caught in the middle of the unexpected tussle, was forced to mediate, ultimately suggesting that the competing advocates represent the accused as a team, news agency PTI reported.Shehzad has been accused of sneaking into Khan’s upscale Bandra residence in the early hours of January 16. According to police, he climbed to the 12th floor of the Satguru Sharan building using a pipe and entered the actor’s apartment through a bathroom window.Once inside, he was confronted by domestic staff, leading to a scuffle during which Khan was allegedly stabbed multiple times. The 54-year-old actor sustained injuries near his neck and spine and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Khan is said to be in stable condition and recovering well.The clash unfolded moments before the accused could sign the legal document () authorising representation, causing confusion. Another lawyer pushed his way to the accused's box and secured Shehzad's signature on his own, leading to a brief moment of confusion over who would represent the alleged attacker.The accused was arrested after a three-day manhunt. Police tracked him to a labour camp in Thane using CCTV footage and inputs from a labour contractor. Authorities allege that Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national who entered India illegally six months ago, had assumed the alias Vijay Das.While initial investigations suggest theft as the motive, police have not ruled out the possibility of an international conspiracy. Shehzad was remanded to police custody for five days to allow further interrogation.Outside the court, Sherkhane, the lawyer representing the accused denied allegations of Shehzad’s Bangladeshi origin, saying, “The police have no evidence to prove my client is from Bangladesh. He has been living in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. The claim that he entered six months ago is baseless.”The lawyers also criticised procedural lapses in the investigation. “The remand copy lacks any mention of an intent to murder, yet serious charges have been levelled against him. No proper investigation has been conducted,” Sherkhane added. Prajapati echoed these concerns, arguing that no substantial recovery had been made, and no documentation supported claims of Shehzad’s foreign origin.","Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad, 30, is accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

ePlane company gets DGCA acceptance for type certification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eplane-company-gets-dgca-acceptance-for-type-certification/articleshow/117382263.cms,"Representative photo

CHENNAI: The electric aircraft developed by startup ePlane Company has received acceptance for type certification from Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ). This is the first Indian private company to get accepted under the new rules for electric vertical takeoff and landing ( eVTOL ) aircraft issued last September.The DGCA issued airworthiness criteria for type certification of vertical take off and landing capable aircraft (VCA) and issued specifications for vertiports (terminals) used by them.Prof. Satya Chakravarthy, founder told TOI the company has many firsts, including acceptance for testing eVTOLs in India, testing propellers for the first time in the Indo-Pacific region. The startup aims to complete test flights by the end of 2026. “We will make multiple prototypes and then clock cumulative flying hours to demonstrate compliance,” he said.The company plans to provide air ambulances, cargo planes, chartered flights in tourist sites and air taxis in major metros. “The aircraft is spacious enough to operate an air ambulance with a stretcher that can be wheeled into the aircraft. So there is an air ambulance, charter flights in tourist locations, aerial cargo, in addition to the taxis…We are scoping partners such as hospitals, vertiport builders, charging infrastructure providers as well as charter operators. The company is striking partnerships with real estate players for vertiport building, airports, logistic providers, but these are in very early stages,” he said.The company is currently testing only in India as the global regulatory framework for eVTOLs evolves. “The Indian market is probably a lot more primed for this. Even than the advanced economies mainly because our city infrastructure is actually not that great and higher volumes of traffic,” he said.Prof Chakravarthy is also optimistic on the viability of the business compared to traditional air ambulances, as helicopters have maintenance and fuel costs and thus lower patronage and asset utilisation. ""We are going to climb down a spiral where we will essentially say that it's going to become a lot more affordable within what insurance companies today are willing to cover for,” he said.The IIT-M incubated startup so far raised $20 million and plans to raise up to $30 million. “ The more money would actually mean that we can go to market directly instead of just finishing certification. It depends on how the market appetite grows for this as we are able to show the first prototype flights,” he said.",The electric aircraft developed by startup ePlane Company has received acceptance for type certification from Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

Poll Do You Think Illegal Immigration Impacts the Job Market? No, It Doesn’t Have a Significant Effect Yes, It Creates Unfair Competition for Jobs

MUMBAI: The arrest of illegal Bangladeshi immigrant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir for last week’s attempted robbery and assault on actor Saif Ali Khan at his residence in Bandra has reignited concerns about unauthorised entry and stay in the country.Since Bangladeshis, whether illegal or legal immigrants, are often willing to work for less money than the prevailing rate in the city, they are readily hired as labourers, jewellery artisans, domestic help and other such workers, many times through unverified sources, say the police.Crime branch sources said Bangladeshis entering the country illegally typically do this through regions like Malda, 24 Parganas, Murshidabad, Dineshpur and Chapali Nawabganj. Once here, the illegal immigrants reportedly pay Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000 to obtain fake Aadhaar cards with the help of agents. These documents enable them to settle in any part of the country. Agents assist them in securing jobs for a commission.“There is a vast network operating in India that helps these illegal immigrants settle here,” an officer said. “They are not afraid of cases being registered against them, because it guarantees their prolonged stay. Until the case reaches a judgment, they cannot be deported. Moreover, they secure bail within days and continue living a normal life.”Even with regular deportation drives, the illegals keep growing as many re-enter the country under new identities. Many if them get work as housemaids, cooks, fish sellers, casual labourers, and some even enter the flesh trade.In a recent operation, the police and crime branch arrested 30 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants . Last year 310 Bangladeshi nationals staying illegally were arrested by the police in the city alone. Some of the arrested had even been casting votes in elections for years.CM Devendra Fadnavis recently said illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were seeking birth certificates in the state to obtain voting rights. He called it ‘vote jihad part 2’. “Nearly 100 such cases have been reported in Amravati and Malegaon taluka in Nashik. These people, many aged around 50 years, are obtaining documents illegally,” he said at the state BJP convention in Shirdi.During the Nov assembly poll campaign, Fadnavis had cited instances of a community voting en masse against the BJP in the Lok Sabha election held earlier in 2024, and had termed it ‘vote jihad’.In Dec, he had said that a detention centre would be built in the city to keep illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.Last year the crime branch unit 1 arrested a person, Mohammad Idris Sheikh alias Joshimuddin Bishu Dewan, a Bangladeshi residing in the city since 1994. The arrest took place near Charni Road station. During the investigation, officials discovered a “rate chart” detailing the sums paid by Bangladeshis to agents for illegal entry into the country.There is a large demand for maids in the city for domestic and housekeeping work, and Bangladeshis are willing to fill the gap.“There is scarcity of maids and cooks and local workers demand large sums. In comparison Bangladeshis are ready to work round-the-clock and come cheap,” Chaya Kadam, a city resident, said.","The arrest of illegal Bangladeshi immigrant Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir for last week’s attempted robbery and assault on actor Saif Ali Khan has reignited concerns about unauthorised entry and stay in the country.

Here’s a quick guide, calculations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/8th-pay-commission-news-how-much-salary-hike-can-central-government-employees-expect-heres-a-quick-guide-calculations/articleshow/117324025.cms,"The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines, was implemented from January 1, 2016.

Poll Do You Believe Government Employees Should Have Higher Salaries Than Private Sector Employees? No, Private Sector Should Be Paid More Yes, They Should Be Compensated More

8th Pay Commission: How much salary hike to expect?

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor?

The fitment factor serves as a multiplication coefficient employed to determine the revised compensation for central government staff and retirees. It represents an essential element of the Pay Commission, utilised when implementing salary and pension increases following new commission guidelines.

The variation in grade pay assessment and irregular spacing between pay bands directly influences the quantum of fitment benefits. This inconsistency led numerous stakeholders to advocate for the implementation of a uniform fitment factor applicable across all employee categories.

The 7th Pay Commission established a standard fitment benefit of 2.57 applicable to all central government employees. This factor resulted in raising the minimum basic pay to ""Rs 18,000"" monthly from the previous ""Rs. 7,000"" (2.57 times the basic remuneration under the 6th Pay Commission).

A practical demonstration helps explain how public sector workers can determine their revised salary using the fitment factor set by the 8th Pay Commission. Consider a scenario where your current basic pay is Rs 40,000 monthly, and let’s assume that the 8th Pay Commission suggests a fitment factor of 2.5. This calculation would raise your basic salary to Rs 1 lakh per month.

Initially, dearness allowance remains excluded, as per typical pay commission guidelines. The dearness allowance component gets incorporated into the salary structure during subsequent years, following pay commission recommendations. Additional allowances might undergo modifications based on the pay commission's directives.

8th Pay Commission latest news : In good news for central government employees, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission. With this, central government employees can look forward to a salary hike.PM Modi shared on X: ""We are all proud of the efforts of all Government employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on the 8th Pay Commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption.""The decision comes months after the dearness allowance for central government employees crossed 50% of central government employees' basic salary. From July 1, 2024, central government staff and pensioners have been receiving 53% of their basic pay as dearness allowance/relief, with the next adjustment scheduled for January 2025.The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines implemented from January 1, 2016, will be updated after the 8th Pay Commission recommendations. ET consulted experts regarding potential salary increases, considering historical pay commission recommendations.Krishnendu Chatterjee, TeamLease Vice President, was quoted as saying, ""The Last Pay Commission was established in 2016, which recommended the minimum pay jump from 7,000 per month to 18,000 per month with a fitment factor of 2.57 times of basic pay. The maximum ceiling is 2.5 lakhs per month. Considering the inflation factor, there are indications that the fitment factor may stay between 2.5- 2.8 times, which will give a significant boost to employee salaries between Rs 40,000 and Rs 45,000. There are also suggestions of Performance based pay hike which are still under deliberation.""Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: Cabinet approves constitution of 8th Pay Commission; central government employees eye pay hike According to Rohitaashv Sinha from King Stubb & Kasiva, ""Pay commissions are in most cases established every 10 years to assess and provide changes to the remunerations of central government employees. The last pay commission, i.e. the 7th pay commission took effect in January 2016 and gave a raise on the minimum basic pay from Rs 7000 to Rs 18000 using the fitment factor 2.57. In the 8th Pay Commission, it is believed that the increase the minimum basic pay will be an astonishing 186%. This may make the minimum basic pay to INR 51,480 per month. It seems that the fitment factor for it is 2.86. The changes are likely to be implemented through the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2025 and may lead to enhanced pension and other retiral benefits such as EPF, Gratuity etc. and recommend changes in salary structures for government employees.""SKV Law Offices' Senior Associate Nihal Bhardwaj explains that historical data suggests central government staff might receive a 25-30% pay rise under the 8th Pay Commission. The 6th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2006, covering the period 2006–2016) utilised a 1.86 fitment factor, delivering a 40% increase in wages, whilst the 7th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2016, covering the period 2016–2026) employed a 2.57 fitment factor, yielding approximately 23-25% higher salaries.Staff associations are currently pushing for a fitment factor between 3.0 and 3.5, which could potentially elevate the minimum basic salary from Rs 18,000 to roughly Rs 25,000–Rs 26,000. Such adjustments would result in substantial improvements across all pay grades, he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

Govt may lift ban on lawyers fighting cases to get elderly their maintenance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-may-lift-ban-on-lawyers-fighting-cases-to-get-elderly-their-maintenance/articleshow/117380038.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: The Centre is mulling lifting the ban on lawyers in trial proceedings under the law to secure maintenance for neglected parents , but without compromising the core idea which barred them in the first place.Sources said a proposal is on the table to allow lawyers to take up cases of senior citizens before tribunals under the “Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act”, while keeping the bar intact on use of legal professionals by children against whom the cases are filed.The nudge for the change has come from the “learning experience”, where the seniors face difficulty in articulating their case before tribunals, handicapping them against their progeny in arguments to prove neglect and maltreatment. It is felt that engaging lawyers will help the elderly in fighting their claims and securing maintenance.Section 17 of the Act states, “Notwithstanding anything contained in any law, no party to a proceeding before a tribunal or appellate tribunal shall be represented by a legal practitioner.”The social justice and empowerment ministry’s proposal, if it comes to fruition, would mark a major departure from the provisions of the Act where lawyers were kept out after much brainstorming within the govt, and with stakeholders, when the law was framed in 2007. The philosophy behind such a stand was that the Act was being put in place to enable the elderly to fight neglect and ill treatment by their children, in what was the first of its kind of dedicated legislation to address the problems faced in families across generations.But it was felt that such a provision would deliver results only if the trials were speedy and without legal manoeuvrings that are part of courtroom processes. The law lays down that an application for maintenance has to be disposed of within 90 days. The ban on lawyers was specifically to help the older generation, while the stress of the process has been on reconciliation rather than penal provisions which are also provided for in the law.So, while lawyers may in the future be allowed to participate in the proceedings, it would still be to help the seniors.Over 17 years, the Centre stuck to the “no-lawyer” stance despite nudges from various sections, including the high courts of Punjab and Haryana, and Madras. A panel constituted by the ministry in 2016 rejected the suggestion to lift the bar on legal practitioners by arguing that the provision helped in dispensing speedy and cost-effective justice to senior citizens.At a “national consultation” on the issue in Aug 2016, the Bar Council of India dubbed as “outdated” the perception that participation of lawyers hits speedy justice, but its plea for allowing lawyers in tribunals was met with strong resistance from states, NGOs and also the Law Commission.","The Centre is mulling lifting the ban on lawyers in trial proceedings under the law to secure maintenance for neglected parents.

PRYAGRAJ: As the Maha Kumbh unfolds to mark the world’s largest gathering of people over the 45-day mela that started on Jan 13, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence-enabled monitoring of population density per square metre, inflow and outflow of people and ground assessments by authorities shows that on a regular day around 10-15 lakh people are estimated to be visiting the mela and belong to the “floating” lot of visitors who come and go.Another 50 to 60 lakh people are estimated to be staying in Maha Kumbh Nagar , taking the total number of people present at the mela on any given day to 65-70 lakh.On the first day of the mela on Jan 13 – known as Paush Purnima nearly 1.65 crore devotees converged at the Triveni Sangam and the ghats along the river. On Jan 14, the number of visitors shot up to 3.5 crore. Now, the administration is gearing up for Jan 29 when nearly 6 crore people are expected to participate in the Shahi Snan on Mauni Amavasya.With nearly 40 crore people expected to throng to Maha Kumbh Nagar, at the core of this monitoring exercise are the Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCC) where hundreds of police personnel, officials and experts are busy keeping a watch on every alert on their screen to check and issue directions to avert a stampede, check barricade breaches, streamline traffic management and even check crime.TOI visited one of the ICCCs to understand what goes on behind the scenes to arrive at the numbers being cited by the administration. As large screens, throw up images of the busy ghats, data charts reflect how AI is delivering real-time information on population density and the people entering and leaving ghats from more than half a dozen prime entry and exit points.Superintendent of police, in-charge of ICCCs, Amit Kumar said that with thousands of cameras capturing the crucial data in the Kumbh area and the city, AI is proving to be an enabler in addition to the institutional ground information from the area and railways and road transport department. He shared that using the information, the police are also able to send out alerts on deciding on diversions and act in time to prevent overcrowding. He said AI is helping them bolster not just estimates of visitors but also engage in traffic management and check crime.A team is also working to collate data from different departments and ministries like railways, road and transport and highways.Additional DM Vivek Chaturvedi saidthe AI model being used at the ICCCs has been tested repeatedly on population density per square metre and related algorithms that reflected an accuracy of 90 to 92%.",Maha Kumbh is the world’s largest gathering of people over the 45-day mela that started on Jan 13.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing investigation into the stabbing case of Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan, a fresh angle has emerged as the accused’s advocate has questioned claims about his Bangladeshi origin. The advocate, Sandeep Shekhane, stated that police have no evidence to prove that Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad , the accused, is a Bangladeshi national .Shortly after Shehzad’s arrest on Sunday morning from Hiranandani Estate in Thane, police said he had entered India six months ago from Bangladesh. However, Shekhane refuted these allegations, asserting that his client has been living in Mumbai for over seven years with his family.“Police custody for five days has been granted, and the court has directed them to submit a report within this time frame. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. The claim that he came here six months ago is false. This is a clear violation of Section 43A as no proper investigation has been conducted,” Shekhane said.He has also alleged procedural lapses in the case and questioned the grounds on which police custody was granted.Sherkhane said, “There are lapses. The notice was not complied with as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court. Police custody was given, but there is no mention of threatening of life or murder in the remand copy or FIR copy. Despite this, sections are being implicated. There was no intention of murder.”Another advocate of accused, Dinesh Prajapati also refuted these allegations, saying that his client has been living in Mumbai with his family.“The police demanded custody, but the grounds provided were insufficient,” Prajapati said. “In his defence, we argued that nothing has been recovered from him, and the police have not produced any documents proving he is a Bangladeshi national. Despite this, the court has granted a five-day police custody.”Shehzad, 30, is accused of attacking Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra residence in the wee hours of Thursday. The intruder allegedly broke into Khan’s upscale home and stabbed him multiple times with a knife.The actor sustained injuries to his neck and near the spine and is currently being treated at Lilavati Hospital , where he is in stable condition.Police are now probing whether the attack was premeditated and if Shehzad had any accomplices.

NEW DELHI: The Army is now putting its full weight behind the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems , with orders worth Rs 10,200 crore for its ammunition to be cleared soon, even as India is also exporting the systems to other countries.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said two Pinaka contracts — Rs 5,700 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented ammunition and Rs 4,500 crore for area denial munitions — are all set to be inked before the current fiscal ends on March 31. These orders will cater for the 10 Pinaka regiments already ordered by the over 11-lakh strong Army, which also has three Russian-origin Smerch and five Grad rocket regiments.While the force has inducted four Pinaka regiments, with some of the launchers also deployed in high-altitude areas along the northern borders with China, the other six are in the process of being inducted to add “more punch and lethality” to its arsenal. “The Pinaka is one of the best rocket systems in the world. Its regiments have been high-altitude enabled,” a senior officer said.The high-explosive pre-fragmented ammunition has a strike range of 45 km, while the aerial denial munitions can be launched to a distance of 37 km. The latter have the capability to saturate a target area with multiple bomblets, including anti-tank and anti-personnel minelets.DRDO has developed a variety of ammunition for the Pinaka, including rockets with 45-km extended range and 75-km guided extended range. With the plan underway to further enhance the range first to 120 km and then to 300 km, Gen Dwivedi said, “As soon as we get longer ranges, we might drop plans for other alternate long-range weapons we are looking at and concentrate on it (Pinaka).”The six new Pinaka regiments, under contracts inked with defence PSU Bharat Earth Movers Ltd and private sector companies Tata Advanced Systems and Larsen & Toubro, comprise 114 launchers with automated gun aiming and positioning systems and 45 command posts, along with 330 vehicles. “They are equipped with electronically and mechanically improved weapon systems capable of firing a variety of ammunition over longer ranges,” another officer said.India is also stepping-up plans to export the Pinaka system, along with other products like BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles and Akash air defence missile systems, to ‘friendly’ countries.The former Soviet republic of Armenia, for instance, is importing both Pinaka and Akash systems, as earlier reported by TOI.

NEW DELHI: While stating its intent to work on a “meaningful trade agenda” with the European Union, India has underlined the need for it to be “fair and equitable” and made it clear that there was a need to address tariff and non-tariff barriers.During his first meeting with Maroš Šefovi, the European commissioner for trade and economic security in Brussels over the weekend, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal also asserted that the cooperation on trade and sustainable development should factor in the respective level of developments of the two trading partners and “the principle of common but differentiated responsibility” should be followed that does not put additional burden on a developing country like India.The high-level dialogue is a part of attempts by India and EU to work out a foundation for negotiations for a free trade agreement in which the European trading bloc is also seeking dedicated chapters with commitment on issues such as sustainability, gender and labour. India is of the view that European standards cannot be imposed on it given its level of development prompting the Union minister to lay down the stand while outlining the six key principles.“India would work together with the European Union for developing cutting edge technologies, secure critical raw material supply chains and build resilient supply chains which will reduce dependencies on non-market economies and help developing closer economic ties between India and the EU,” said Goyal during the meet. He also highlighted the “common values of democracy” at a time when countries are reducing their dependence on China.",India has underlined the need for it to be “fair and equitable” and made it clear that there was a need to address tariff and non-tariff barriers.

PM lauds EC for fair polls, says vote in maximum numbers



NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Sunday heaped praise on Election Commission for strengthening democracy through fair polls and using the power of technology to “strengthen people’s power”, his remarks coming amid continuing attacks on the poll body by opposition parties.In the year’s first episode of Mann Ki Baat , Modi said, ""I would like to thank Election Commission, which has modernised and strengthened our voting process from time to time. EC has used the power of technology to strengthen people’s power.""The PM said, “I congratulate the EC for its commitment to fair elections. I would like to urge countrymen to use their right to vote, always, in maximum numbers and also become a part of the country’s democratic process and strengthen this process.” Modi’s endorsement of the EC comes at a time when the poll body faces criticism from Congress and other opposition parties over its conduct of elections. The opposition has alleged discrepancies in the voters list and also in voter turnout numbers, particularly in the Maharashtra assembly polls . They have also constantly cast doubts on electronic voting machines despite the Supreme Court rejecting all allegations against the reliability of EVMs.The PM mentioned National Voters’ Day celebrated on Jan 25 and called it important as on this day, the EC was established. “Our Constitution makers have accorded a very important place to our EC and equally to people’s participation in democracy,” he said. “When the first elections were held in the country in 1951-52, some people were doubtful whether the country's democracy would survive. But our democracy proved all the apprehensions wrong, after all, India is the mother of democracy,” he added.Modi also emphasised on unity and how the founding guardians envisaged the Constitution as an instrument to achieve this objective. He said India’s unity, as envisioned by its founders, was in its diversity and the collective spirit of its people.Ahead of the 75th anniversary of its Republic Day , Modi invoked the luminaries of the Constituent Assembly and played archival audio clips of three members — B R Ambedkar, Rajendra Prasad and Syama Prasad Mookerjee.He highlighted Ambedkar’s role and said, “Babasaheb had been emphasising the fact that the Constituent Assembly should be united, have one opinion and work together for the common good.” The PM also mentioned Prasad’s cultural approach to unity and Mookerjee’s call for equality of opportunities.",PM Modi heaped praise on Election Commission for strengthening democracy through fair polls.

NEW DELHI: Calling ‘ Maha Kumbh ’ a celebration of “unity in diversity”, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said the festival being a “confluence of equality and harmony” tells how the traditions bind the whole of India together, and cited several other examples of similar religious festivals along the banks of different rivers across the country.‘Maha Kumbh’ is under way at ‘Sangam’ — confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — in UP’s Prayagraj.“People from all over India and the world congregate on the sands of the Sangam. There is no discrimination, no casteism anywhere in this tradition which has been going on for thousands of years... In the Kumbh, the rich and the poor come together as one. All of them take a dip at the Sangam, dine together in the ‘bhandaras’, receive ‘prasad’ that is why the Kumbh is the Maha Kumbh of unity,” said Modi in his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’ — the first for this year.He narrated how the ways of “adhering to the beliefs are the same” from north to south, and cited examples of ‘Kumbh’ being organised at Prayagraj, Ujjain, Nasik and Haridwar in the north, and ‘Pushkaram’ on the banks of Godavari, Krishna, Narmada and Kaveri rivers in the south.“Both these festivals are connected with our holy rivers and their beliefs. Similarly, from Kumbakonam to Tirukkad-Yur, from Kood-Vasal to Tirucherai, there are many such temples whose traditions are connected with Kumbh,” he said.Referring to the ‘ Ganga Sagar Mela ’, organised in West Bengal, he said, “On the auspicious occasion of Sankranti, lakhs of devotees from all over the world took a dip at this fair. ‘Kumbh’, ‘Pushkaram’ and ‘Ganga Sagar Mela’ — these festivals of ours are festivals that enhance our social coalescence, harmony, unity.”He also lauded efforts of Indian scientists for their achievements and specifically mentioned their success in undertaking space docking of satellites that made India the fourth country to have achieved this success.Modi said scientists are making efforts to grow plants in space. “For this, ISRO scientists chose cow pea seeds. These, sent on Dec 30, germinated in space. This is a very inspiring experiment which will pave the way for growing vegetables in space in the future,” he said.","‘Maha Kumbh’ is under way at ‘Sangam’ — confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — in UP’s Prayagraj.

VIJAYAWADA: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that India has emerged as a global leader in disaster management through its revolutionary approach under Prime Minister Narendra Modi by adopting a ‘zero-casualty goal’ during calamities.After inaugurating the south campus of National Institute of Disaster Management and National Disaster Response Force 10th battalion buildings at Kondapavuluru near in Vijayawada, Shah said while earlier the approach to disaster was relief-centric, this has now undergone 360-degree change, becoming ‘rescue-centric’ to save people.“India has taken a lead in the entire world in disaster-resilient infrastructure by setting up CDRI ( Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure ) under PM Modi’s leadership,” he said, adding that 48 countries have become members of CDRI.Attacking the erstwhile Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy regime, he said the governance in Andhra Pradesh from 2019 to 2024 was a “man-made disaster” and assured NDA govt’s commitment to rescue the state from the crisis.At a meeting later, Shah spoke of Centre’s support to Andhra, emphasising that Rs 3 lakh crore has been extended to the state in six months.

VIJAYAWADA: Asserting that the TDP-led NDA govt in Andhra Pradesh has been successful in securing Rs 4 lakh crore investments in just seven months, minister for IT and HRD Nara Lokesh said it is essential to have consistent policies and continuity in governance. The national general secretary of TDP said the first question they receive from investors in India and abroad is about what happens if there is a change of govt in the state.Lokesh, who is responsible for big-ticket investments like Google, Reliance, and TCS in the state, said it took a lot of perseverance to convince industry giants to set shop in Andhra after the “devastating” five-year rule of YSRCP. “People of AP should also make a distinction between the previous destructive govt and the present NDA govt. They have to judge two models of governance and ensure the state continues on the path of development by electing NDA in successive terms,” he said.In an interview to STOI, Lokesh said the govt is working to make Andhra a preferred investment destination with the speed of doing business. “We want to compete with not only our fellow states but also with countries like Dubai and Singapore,” he said.He thanked Union govt for its “amazing support” to the state and said it would be a crime at some point if they ask for more. “Capital Amaravati and Polavaram are on track now, and Visakhapatnam steel plant is getting revived. BPCL refinery, NTPC green hydrogen project, and railway line to Amaravati are happening with the support of Union govt,” he mentioned.Responding to the implementation of ‘Red Book’ (a record maintained by Lokesh before the assembly polls), he said it was endorsed by the people, and it is one of the reasons people came out to vote in large numbers. However, he clarified that it will not be used for vindictive politics.","Nara Lokesh is responsible for big-ticket investments like Google, Reliance, and TCS in the state.

""I remember all those great people who gave us the Constitution. Many discussions happened then. They are our heritage. I want to show you the original voice of some of the leaders. Dr BR Ambedkar said many things, I am showing you his words.""

""Maha Kumbh has started. This celebrates unity in diversity. People from all over the world converge at Sangam. Rich or poor, all are same at Sangam. They eat together at Bhandaras. It unites from the south to the north. There has been a greater participation by youths in this Kumbh. When youths are connected to the culture, it makes the country strong. Gangasagar Mela was also organised in West Bengal. People from all over the world joined on Makar Sankranti. We celebrated the anniversary of pran pratishtha of Ram Temple. We need to keep our heritage intact while moving on the path of development.""

""You must have seen that the youth are extensively participating in Kumbh. It is true that when the young generation proudly joins its civilization, then its roots become stronger and its golden future is assured. This time we are also witnessing the digital footprints on a large scale in Kumbh.""

""I hope you will enjoy these words. We all need to work together. On January 25, there is National Voters' Day, because on the day ECI was formed. They have a bigger place in the country. When the first election happened, people doubted on democracy. But it has continued. I thank the ECI for making the process more robust. I congratulate the ECI for their impartial elections. I urge the voters to participate in the elections.""

Start-up India is taking shape, many start-ups are coming from two-tier, three-tier cities. Women are participating with a lot of enthusiasm. Earlier, start-ups used to be mocked. But it was changed in last decade. I want to say people to dream big. In our big country, if any person is doing a great, he needs to be hailed. Deepak Nabam is helping the homeless through his organisation. His organisation has been hailed.

'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: "" Sab sawaal ahamiyat rakhte hai, jawaab toh banta hai; aadatan kalam band jawaab dete rahe, aaj rubaroo toh banta hain.Kya pata kal ho ya na hon, aaj jawab banta hai ( All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Shocking Change In Trump's Inauguration Plans; Americans 'Upset' After Unexpected Shift | Watch

Meghan Markle’s leadership style led some staff members to require therapy or take extended leave after working with her on professional projects, according to reports by Vanity Fair.In a recent profile marking five years since the Sussexes stepped back from royal duties, multiple individuals described their experiences working with the Duchess as emotionally taxing.Staff involved in Meghan’s projects, such as her Archetypes podcast for Spotify, reportedly found the work environment so challenging that they sought extended breaks or long-term counselling.One source likened the experience to being in a high-stress teenage drama, claiming, “It’s talking behind your back. It’s gnawing at your sense of self. Really, like, Mean Girls-teenager.”A former colleague recounted their initial excitement about joining Meghan’s team, only to later feel disillusioned, realising the negative atmosphere was not uncommon.Another said the tension stemmed from undermining behaviours, adding, “You can be yelled at even if somebody doesn’t raise their voice. It’s funny that people don’t differentiate between the energy of being yelled at and literally somebody screaming at you.”The Vanity Fair report alleges that several staff members either left their jobs or required professional help after enduring the demanding environment. One individual who worked on the podcast reportedly took a leave of absence after just three episodes, with others describing the need for extended breaks to escape scrutiny.One source claimed that working under Meghan led them to reevaluate their own principles: “I left because I couldn’t live with myself anymore.”These new claims echo earlier allegations from 2018, when Meghan faced a formal bullying complaint during her time as a working royal. That complaint alleged she had driven two personal assistants out of the household. While Buckingham Palace conducted an internal investigation, the findings were never publicly released.Meghan has consistently denied all bullying allegations.Sources quoted by Vanity Fair also suggested Meghan’s leadership approach involves harsh scrutiny of team members. One insider remarked: “She’s constantly playing checkers, not chess, but she’s very aware of where everybody is on her board. And when you are not in, you are to be thrown to the wolves at any given moment.”Another observer said the Duchess’s approach has damaged perceptions of her: “I think if Meghan acknowledged her own shortcomings or personal contributions to situations rather than staying trapped in a victim narrative, her perception might be better.”While Meghan’s media projects, including her podcast and Netflix collaborations, have drawn significant public interest, insiders suggest the couple has faced challenges navigating the entertainment industry.","Staff involved in Meghan's projects reportedly found the work environment so challenging that they sought extended breaks or long-term counselling.

US President-elect Donald Trump will take office on January 20 and will issue some of the orders on his first day in his second term of the office.In a conversation with NBC News on Saturday, Trump indicated his intention to issue an unprecedented number of executive orders following his oath of office, starting immediately after delivering his inaugural address on Monday.He stated that whilst the exact number of orders remained undetermined, it would set a new record.When questioned about whether it would surpass 100, Trump confirmed it would ""at least in that category.""The incoming president is anticipated to issue directives reversing numerous policies implemented during President Joe Biden's outgoing administration.Trump's first-day agenda for his new term includes implementing a large-scale deportation initiative.Speaking to NBC, Trump confirmed the removal of undocumented migrants would ""begin very, very quickly.""""I can't say which cities because things are evolving. And I don't think we want to say what city. You'll see it firsthand,"" he stated during the telephone interview.Trump had already arrived in Washington before his inauguration, with the Republican billionaire scheduled to participate in various events and festivities prior to assuming the presidency. Trump, accompanied by his wife Melania and family members, landed at Dulles International Airport and watched a fireworks display at his Virginia golf club near Washington.Donald Trump has promised to launch the ""largest deportation program in American history"" beginning on his first day in office. His incoming ""border czar,"" Tom Homan, has proposed a hotline for Americans to report undocumented migrants suspected of committing crimes.Trump also plans to end policies that limit immigration raids in churches and schools. Any mass deportation program would face logistical challenges and legal opposition from immigration and human rights groups, BBC reported.Trump may reinstate his ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, which sent around 70,000 asylum seekers back to Mexico while awaiting hearings. He also aims to end birthright citizenship, a 150-year-old constitutional right, although eliminating it would require a complex constitutional amendment. Trump's administration may seek to justify closing the southern border under public health grounds using Title 42, and he has expressed intentions to complete the border wall he began building during his first term.Trump has promised to implement significant tariffs on imported goods to prioritize American manufacturing. While he imposed tariffs during his first term, including those on China, he plans to escalate them in his second term. His proposal includes a 10% tariff on all imports, 25% on Canadian and Mexican goods, and 60% on Chinese imports, with executive orders to be signed on day one.Trump has been a strong advocate for cryptocurrency, and his election in 2016 saw Bitcoin’s value surge by 30%. He has suggested creating a federal ""Bitcoin stockpile,"" a strategic reserve similar to the US stockpiles of gold and oil. This move would aim to make Bitcoin a permanent national asset benefiting all Americans. Crypto enthusiasts are optimistic about this proposal, as well as potential moves to reduce regulatory oversight in the industry.Trump consistently describes the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot arrestees as ""political prisoners"" and ""hostages"".Initially, he pledged immediate pardons upon assuming office.However, his recent statements have become less definitive regarding both the timing and scope of potential pardons for riot defendants.""Most likely, I'll do it very quickly,"" Trump stated on Meet the Press last month, whilst indicating there ""may be some exceptions"" to his pardon plans.Furthermore, Vice President-elect JD Vance caused discord amongst supporters on Sunday by suggesting pardons should be limited to peaceful demonstrators, noting certain cases presented ""a bit of grey area"".In recent times, educational institutions and companies throughout the United States have implemented policies aimed at backing women and ethnic minorities.These ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" (DEI) initiatives have sparked opposition from conservative groups and encountered judicial opposition. Following his election, Trump has vowed to eliminate these programmes, whilst major firms including Meta, Walmart and Amazon have started reducing their related schemes.Through executive authority, Trump could prevent federal funds from reaching institutions with DEI programmes. Additionally, he could restrict funding to educational establishments teaching ""critical race theory"" (CRT).Trump has consistently opposed what he terms ""transgender lunacy"" in educational and healthcare settings, specifically pledging to prevent transgender women from participating in women's athletic competitions.","US President-elect Donald Trump will take office on January 20 and will issue some of the orders on his first day in his second term of the office.

Patrick Mahomes vs. Aaron Rodgers in terms of passing yards and touchdowns

Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers are two of the NFL's most celebrated quarterbacks, known for their exceptional skills, leadership, and game-winning performances. Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs ’ star, and Rodgers, now with the New York Jets, have both built impressive legacies. This comparison explores their net worth, contracts, career stats, and achievements to uncover how these NFL icons stack up against each other.Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers are not just NFL legends on the field—they’re also powerhouses when it comes to building wealth. As of 2024, Patrick Mahomes’s net worth is estimated at $90 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. This fortune stems from his groundbreaking 10-year, $477 million contract, one of the largest in sports history along with $26 million in bonuses and lucrative endorsement deals.Meanwhile, Aaron Rodgers takes it to another level with a staggering net worth of $200 million, more than double Mahomes’s fortune. Thanks to his high-paying contracts and sharp investment strategies, Rodgers has earned over $300 million from NFL salaries alone. In 2022, he signed a three-year, $150.8 million deal with the Green Bay Packers, including $101.5 million guaranteed.In 2023, his move to the New York Jets brought another impressive contract: $112.5 million over three years, with $75 million guaranteed. On top of that, endorsements with major brands like State Farm, Adidas, and TaylorMade Golf contribute an additional $9-11 million annually, further solidifying Rodgers’s financial legacy.Patrick Mahomes has cemented his legacy as one of the NFL’s elite quarterbacks, leading the Kansas City Chiefs to three Super Bowl victories and four appearances since taking the reins in 2018. With an impressive 15-3 playoff record, Mahomes boasts an 83.3% winning rate, highlighting his dominance in high-pressure games.Not only has Mahomes played in four Super Bowls placing him among just eight quarterbacks in NFL history to achieve this feat but he’s also guided the Chiefs to six consecutive AFC Championship Games, further solidifying his postseason credentials.In contrast, Aaron Rodgers, with just one Super Bowl win to his name, faces a different trajectory. While Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP, his playoff record doesn’t quite measure up to Mahomes’.Despite battling an Achilles injury in his debut season with the Jets, Rodgers is determined to lead New York in 2024. As a four-time NFL MVP, his wealth of experience and leadership are poised to elevate the Jets as they aim for a successful campaign.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes shares glimpse of gorgeous customized nursery for baby Golden Raye Patrick Mahomes has racked up 29,083 passing yards and 224 touchdowns over his career.

With an estimated $200 million compared to Mahomes' $90 million, Rodgers has built a substantial financial empire through his high-paying contracts and successful endorsements.

Way too many accidents happen with sickening regulatory there and I am deeply saddened Jeyesh became the latest statistic. Much stronger regulatory oversight required here.

We had invested in Jeyesh's venture Tools Hub, a fast growing hardware retail store franchise. His father Anand suggested the name Karuvi and it was Tools Hub distributor Abdul Gafoor, a long time Zoho customer and good friend of Anand who suggested the idea of Karuvi to us.

Jeyesh was a dashing young man, very kind to his employees and all those around him. He had the world ahead of him.

He was a risk taker. So am I but even at his age I would do a risk analysis and would have declined para-gliding in Kulu as too accident prone. I hope young people, particularly young men, avoid bad risks like this.

I hope his death does not go in vain and regulators take a good look at this.

All of us came together to bid tearful farewell to Jeyesh yesterday. Om Shanti 🙏

MUMBAI: A manhunt that spanned three days came to a successful conclusion when Mumbai and Thane police apprehended Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, a 30-year-old illegal immigrant from Bangladesh.The accused, who had entered India undetected, had already made headlines after attempting to rob and assault Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan in his Bandra residence.Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, also known by his alias Bijoy Das, entered India illegally through the West Bengal border sometime before 2024.Known for the desperate job-seeking spree, Shariful’s initial attempts to settle in West Bengal didn’t pan out due to limited employment opportunities.In June 2024, he found employment through an agent who connected him to Jitendra Pandey, a small-time manpower agency owner operating in Worli and Thane.Pandey, seemingly unaware of Shariful’s illegal status, provided him with a housekeeping job at a popular pub in Worli. However, his tenure ended abruptly in August after pub management caught him stealing.Despite being dismissed, Shariful managed to stay connected with Pandey, who, perhaps driven by business urgency, arranged another job for him at a restaurant in Thane in September.Once again, Pandey’s negligence in verifying his employee’s credentials allowed Shariful to slip through unnoticed.During his short stints in the workforce, Shariful was repeatedly asked by employers to present his Aadhaar card, a common requirement in India for identity verification.Each time, he claimed he had “lost” his documents—a lie fabricated by a well-oiled network specializing in providing fake Aadhaar cards to illegal immigrants.Police later discovered that Shariful had in fact used such a card to secure employment in Mumbai and Thane, facilitated by agents willing to sell fake documents for a hefty fee.Out of work, and desperate for money, he started plotting a criminal act—planning to rob wealthy homes in areas like Bandra and Khar, where the affluent resided.His targeting wasn’t random; he had closely studied high-value areas in Mumbai, intending to burglarise upscale flats.On January 16, around 1.30am, Shariful entered the Satguru Sharan building in Bandra. Using climbing skills and prior knowledge, he gained entry to a luxury flat on the 11th floor.This was no ordinary burglary. Shariful had zeroed in on a high-profile target—Saif Ali Khan’s residence.When Shariful attempted to ransack the flat, he was spotted by the household nanny, who confronted him.A struggle ensued, during which Shariful demanded Rs 1 crore.When the family woke up and tried to intervene, Shariful became violent—leading to a scuffle that ended with him stabbing Saif Ali Khan and injuring others present at the scene.In a bid to escape, Shariful fled into the night, leaving behind a trail of fear.The police, alerted immediately, sprang into action. A 150-member team from Mumbai and Thane, aided by CCTV footage, combed through hours of recordings across Bandra, Khar, Dadar, Worli, and Thane.The visual evidence traced Shariful’s movements—his presence captured entering and exiting from multiple locations.One of the crucial markers that helped identify Shariful was the color and pattern of his shoes, which appeared distinctly across multiple footage clips.Using this, the team tracked him through Bandra station, Dadar, Worli, and ultimately to a hideout in Thane, where he had sought refuge.After evading capture in Bandra, Shariful wandered through the area for hours, changing clothes and hiding in bushes before hopping on a train to Dadar.From Dadar, he switched to a bus, eventually reaching Worli—where he had previously worked at a restaurant. In Worli, he sought refuge in a room shared by other workers under Pandey's agency.However, as news of the attack spread, Pandey, sensing trouble, tipped off the police.This crucial lead set the authorities on a frantic chase, tracking Shariful through Mumbai to Thane, where he was ultimately found.On January 19, after combing through 30 acres of dense vegetation near Thane Metro’s casting yard, Shariful was located by officers hiding under a pile of dry leaves, trying to remain concealed.During interrogation, Shariful confessed to the crime, revealing his intent to rob wealthy flats in Bandra or Khar. He admitted to using fake names to secure jobs and had no idea he had entered a celebrity's house.Shariful had carefully plotted his escape, changing clothes and using public transport to elude capture.His true nationality—Bangladeshi—emerged when police delved into his background.Along with his confession to the crime, authorities discovered crucial evidence stored on his phone, including a birth certificate and family contact details from his home country.The arrest of Shariful has put the spotlight back on the well-organized network aiding illegal immigrants, many from Bangladesh, who enter India.Agents play a significant role in helping these migrants obtain fake Aadhaar cards and secure jobs. Shariful himself had obtained a job through Jitendra Pandey, who did not verify his documents.Once hired, such individuals blend into the labor force, working as housekeepers, construction workers, or even jewelry artisans—many times without proper documentation.This porous system not only allows these illegal immigrants to live and work without fear but also emboldens them to commit crimes like theft and assault.Despite repeated deportation drives, many such migrants re-enter India under new identities and continue living undetected, often finding work in low-paying jobs.Shariful has been charged under various sections, including armed robbery and attempts to cause grievous harm (BNS sections 311, 312, and 331).Additionally, he faces legal action under the Foreigners’ Act of 1946 and the Foreigners’ Order of 1948 for illegal entry. His apprehension sends a clear message to others in similar situations.","Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, 30, arrested after 72-hour manhunt.

MUMBAI: It was not an easy day to run a marathon, and it reflected in the timings returned by the Indian athletes at the Tata Mumbai Marathon .Anish Thapa won the men's race while Nirmaben Thakor defended her title. The timings recorded by the winners were nowhere close to personal bests or course records. Thapa won in 2:17.23 while Thakor clocked 2:50.06.The common refrain by both set of athletes was that it would greatly benefit them if they were given an early start, along with the amateurs. But that was not the only gripe of the day.The women complained that there was no water available or cyclists to accompany the athletes trailing the leaders.Humidity was definitely a factor, and Anish Thapa took advantage of the conservative approach by his fellow athletes to throw down the hammer around the 30 km mark. Thapa and Man Singh were the breakaway leaders but the former surged into the lead only to see no response coming from Man Singh. Thapa maintained his lead for his first ever win in a major race.Man Singh finished 14 seconds behind Thapa while former winner, Gopi Thonakal clocked 2:19.59. Thapa was pleased as punch and claimed running in the footsteps of his seniors was beneficial ""as I did not have any experience in running 42.2km race"".Both Man Singh and Thonakal said they were fine till the 20-25 km mark. ""Trouble started after that. I dropped from the lead group and concentrated on running my race,"" said Gopi.Man Singh said humidity was a big factor. ""After 25 kms, it was a race for survival. It is colder in the part of the country where I train, Mumbai's humidity clearly affected me,"" said Man Singh.Both Gopi and Man Singh said an early start would be beneficial, a sentiment echoed by the women podium finishers.Nirmaben, who was the surprise winner last year, pulled off a great race to win by 49 seconds after trailing Sonika Parmar by 94 seconds at the 30km mark.Sonika jumped into the lead and maintained it till the 30km mark. Thereafter the conditions affected her as she could only put in a 42.50-minute 10km run from the 30km mark. Nirmaben steadily ate at her lead, putting in 40.52 minutes from 30 km to 40km.Both found the conditions tough, but Nirmaben said running behind the leader was difficult only because there was no water available. ""Even the cyclists were only accompanying the leaders. We were left to fend for ourselves.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

As Donald Trump vowed to keep TikTok from going dark and TikTok thanked Donald Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance, Elon Musk clarified his stand on TikTok ban in the US and said it's not fair that X is not allowed to operate in China.""I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but 𝕏 is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced.

The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.”He said the joint venture was an initial thought which could save TikTok in the US. “By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to stay up.

Understanding world leaders is one of the CIA’s most important jobs. Analysts comb through intelligence collected by spies and publicly available information to create profiles of leaders that can predict behaviours. A chatbot powered by artificial intelligence now helps do that work.Over the past two years, the CIA has developed a tool that allows analysts to talk to virtual versions of foreign presidents and PMs, who answer back. “It is a fantastic example of an app that we were able to rapidly deploy and get out to production in a cheaper, faster fashion,” said Nand Mulchandani , the CIA’s chief technology officer (CTO).The chatbot is part of the spy agency’s drive to improve the tools available to CIA analysts and its officers in the field, and to better understand adversaries’ technical advances. Core to the effort is to make it easier for companies to work with the most secretive agency.William Burns , CIA director for the past four years, prioritised improving the agency’s technology and understanding of how it is used. Incoming Trump administration officials say they plan to build on those initiatives, not tear them down.Under Burns, the agency created a technology-focused mission centre to better understand the technology being used by China and other adversaries. And it hired Mulchandani, who helped found a series of successful startups before joining the Pentagon’s AI centre, as the agency’s first chief technology officer. His mandate over the past two and a half years was to make it easier for private companies that had developed new technologies to be able to sell those applications and tools to the CIA.Many offices in the CIA are warrens of cubicles or have clusters of desks for assistants. When Mulchandani started, he was given a space on the same floor as the CIA’s top leadership, but he was not pleased. He was turned off by the small offices, the lack of natural light and the closetlike rooms for viewing the most classified of material. He ordered a renovation.The old offices were replaced by different spaces with movable desks for meetings and exchanging ideas. The goal was to make a space that echoed the workplaces of Silicon Valley — and signal to visiting entrepreneurs that the agency was ready to change. “The space is going to drive the culture, a culture of talking,” Mulchandani said. “A slice of Silicon Valley on the seventh floor.”",The chatbot is part of the spy agency’s drive to improve the tools available to CIA analysts and its officers in the field.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the court's verdict in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a ""mockery"" of justice and pledged to fight till the last ball and refuse any deals, The Express Tribune reported.In a statement shared on social media platforms Facebook and X, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan condemned the court's decision in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a premeditated move with the verdict and sentencing already leaked to the media before the official announcement.Khan called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice and said that the individuals who wrote the judgement leaked it to the media, undermining the integrity of the legal system, according to The Express Tribune report. PTI founder reiterated his stance against the "" military-backed regime "" and vowed to never accept it.He said, ""I will continue my struggle for true freedom and democracy, even if it means spending more time in jail,"" while emphasising that he will make no compromise on his principles or the fight for Pakistan's true independence, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law, and true freedom for the people of Pakistan. He said, ""We will fight till the last ball, and I will not make any deals. I will face all the false cases brought against me.""He called on the people of Pakistan to read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and compare it to the actions of General Yahya Khan, who he claimed similarly caused the downfall of Pakistan. He said that the current rulers were following the same path, acting in their personal interests and pushing Pakistan towards destruction.On Al-Qadir Trust case , PTI founder accused the judiciary of causing further damaging to its credibility and added that judges who backed ""military rule"" and acted as per their instructions were given rewards. He said that the case should have been focused on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and his son for allegedly selling their property worth 9 billion pound to a business tycoon for 18 billion pound, raising questions on the source of their wealth and why they had not given the requested receipts in the Panama Papers case.He accused Pakistan's former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa of facilitating money laundering in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case , where billions of rupees were forgiven.
