Pydhonie jeweller held in abetment to suicide and cheating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pydhonie-jeweller-held-in-abetment-to-suicide-and-cheating/articleshow/110024922.cms,"MUMBAI: The city police made the first arrest in the abetment to suicide of a 30 year old tea stall owner who ended his life after fraudsters on the pretext of helping him mortage his property sold the property and used documents to avail loans for themselves. The deceased left a suicide note naming all the six persons.The police on Thursday arrested 50-year old Pydhonie based jeweller Sahdev Karmakar who had shut his shop and was on the run for some time.Police are now looking for Karmakar's five accomplices in the crime namely Raguvendra Pujari, Piyush Shah, Mahroof Inamdar, Hemant Sawant, and Urvil Shah.On June 11, last year, tea stall owner Tejas Mahatre a resident of Prabhadevi in Dadar committed suicide by hanging. The Dadar police initially registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) however later his sister Jyotsna Autavkar lodged a complaint alleging that a few days prior to the suicide her brother Tejas was in depression. She said her brother Tejas Mhatre lived in Gharkul Co-operative Housing Society of Prabhadevi. Due to the ill health of Mhatre's mother, Tejas had incurred a debt of Rs 6 to 7 lakh for her treatment. Tejas told his sister that he was unable to pay the heavy interest rate and hence he wanted to mortgage his house and take a lesser interest loan. ``29 year old Tejas approached a few agents namely Raguvendra Pujari, Piyush Shah, Sahdev Karmakar, Mahroof Inamdar, Hemant Sawant, and Urvil Shah to seek a loan of Rs 25 lakhs.'' said an officer.These people took Tejas's property papers and took Tejas and his brother Tushar to the registrar's office, also taking the signatures of both of them. The accused had also taken all the documents of Tejas's house to mortgage it. On June 10 when the bankers came to his house to recover the EMI, Tejas was shocked when they informed him that he had taken a loan of Rs 73 lakhs. Next day he committed suicide by hanging. During the course of investigations it has now come to light that out of Rs 73 lakhs received from the bank, Rs 36.50 lakh was transferred into the accounts of Mahroof Inamdar and Sahdev Karmakar, while Rs 25 lakh has gone to Ragvendra Pujari and Piyush Shah.Jyotsna Otkar, told the police that Tejas had talked about taking a loan by mortgaging the house, but these people took advantage of Tejas's ignorance and not only sold his house but also took a loan on it.When the accused stopped paying the EMI after taking the loan, the bank employees started calling Tejas and visited his house to collect the money. Next day Tejas committed suicide. To establish that deceased committed suicide after being cheated, police recorded statements of various witnesses including Tejas's brother Tushar and sister Jyotsna, the mobile Call Detail reports of the deceased and accused, bank statements, loan documents and inquest panchnama.An official said that during the investigation it transpired that the same gang of accused had been arrested by the MHB colony police and Vile Parle police for similar cheatings.","The police on Thursday arrested 50-year old Pydhonie based jeweller Sahdev Karmakar who had shut his shop and was on the run for some time.

"In major step towards theatre commands, govt notifies tri-service Act",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-major-step-towards-theatre-commands-govt-notifies-tri-service-act/articleshow/110018311.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government has finally notified the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, which will also pave the way for creation of the long-pending unified theatre commands in the most radical military reorganization envisaged since Independence.The enforcement with immediate effect of the ISO Act , which received presidential assent on August 15 last year after the bill was passed by Parliament during the monsoon session, comes soon after the BJP manifesto last month promised its government will “establish military theatre commands for more efficient operations” after creating the chief of defence staff ( CDS ) post in December 2019.Parallelly, CDS General Anil Chauhan chaired a “Parivartan Chintan” here on Thursday-Friday, during which 12 sub-committees made presentations on different domains and aspects towards jointness and integration “in light of the imminent theaterization”, officials said.The flurry of activity shows the stage is now being set for the creation of integrated theatre commands (ITCs), which stalled after the first CDS Gen Bipin Rawat’s death in a helicopter crash in December 2021, amid festering inter-service turf wars.India certainly needs a cost-effective war-fighting machinery through ITCs instead of the existing 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which have little synergy in planning, logistics and operations, and often pull in different directions.The ISO Act empowers military commanders of existing tri-service organizations with full administrative and disciplinary powers over the Army, Navy and IAF personnel serving under them, “without disturbing the unique service conditions of each individual service”. Till now, military personnel were governed by their own service acts like the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950 and the Navy Act, 1957.The ISO Act will also allow the requisite command and control of the proposed ITCs. As per the existing plan, there will be two “adversary-specific” ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur. The Maritime Theatre Command at Karwar in coastal Karnataka, in turn, will be for the Indian Ocean Region as well as the larger Indo-Pacific.The MoD on Friday said, “The Act will empower the heads of ISOs and pave the way for expeditious disposal of cases, avoid multiple proceedings and will be a step towards greater integration and jointness among armed forces personnel.”India currently has only two unified commands, the geographical Andaman and Nicobar Command and the functional Strategic Forces Command to handle the country’s nuclear arsenal, which were set up in 2001 and 2003 after the Kargil conflict with Pakistan.China, incidentally, reorganised its 2-million People’s Liberation Army into five theatre commands in early-2016 to boost offensive capabilities and establish better command-and-control structures. Its Western Theatre Command, for instance, handles the entire 3,488-km Line of Actual Control from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. India, in contrast, has four Army and three IAF commands for the northern borders with China.","The government has finally notified the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act. It will pave the way for creation of the long- pending unified theatre commands. India needs a cost-effective war-fighting machinery through ITCs instead of 17 single-service commands.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110018318,imgsize-43850,width-400,resizemode-4/110018318.jpg"

Judge dismissed for ‘giving electric shocks’ gets back job,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/judge-sacked-for-torturing-court-staff-reinstated-by-hc/articleshow/110019872.cms,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has ordered taking a lower court judge back into judicial service eight years after he was sacked on various charges, including inflicting electric shocks on court staff ""in order to get sadistic pleasure and to physically harass them on the court premises"".This case involved civil judge and judicial magistrate first class Kamlesh Alwani, who was inducted into judicial service in 2005.His services were terminated in 2016 after an inquiry and disciplinary proceedings . When he was suspended in 2012, various charges were slapped on him. During the inquiry, the vigilance officer found that the judge had allegedly administered electric shocks to four employees of the court in Savli. The staffers - peons Deva Bhalani, M H Joshi and P C Joshi and watchman Tanvir Meer - claimed that the judge inflicted electric shocks on them using a tubelight starter.To establish the charge of torture, the statements of the alleged victims were recorded. Alwani was also being probed by the department on 22 other charges, which were not so grave. The inquiry report was submitted to the disciplinary authority in 2014 with the finding that he was guilty of torturing the court staffers. As this conduct was unbecoming of a judicial officer, the high court imposed a major penalty on him and his services were terminated in 2016.He challenged the decision of the HC's administrative side through advocate Vaibhav Vyas, who argued that there were many charges that were not substantiated including that of torturing the court staffers. He argued that the inquiry officer relied only on the statements of witnesses and ignored the expert opinion of a deputy engineer of Madhya Gujarat Vij Co Ltd (MGVCL) which said that electric shocks cannot be administered in the way the victims were claiming. The lawyer submitted that the inquiry officer overlooked the expert opinion and wrongly held the judge guilty of such a serious charge.On behalf of the high court's administration, it was argued that the findings of the inquiry report was accepted by the committee of the high court and the committee arrived at the conclusion that the judge had committed an act ""which was unbecoming of a judicial officer and therefore recommended the punishment of dismissal from service under Rule 6(8) of the Gujarat Civil Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1971."" The HC's lawyer justified the inquiry officer's conclusion that the act of a judicial officer having behaved like an uncivilized man amounts to misconduct.After hearing the case, the bench of Justice Biren Vaishnav and Justice Nisha Thakore found the inquiry officer's conclusion faulty on the allegations of torture and quashed the charge. The bench found the sacking of the judge improper and ordered his reinstatement. The court also ordered imposition of punishment other than termination for the four other charges proved against him.",Kamlesh Alwani was inducted into judicial service in 2005.

India votes in favour of Palestinian resolution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-votes-in-favour-of-palestinian-resolution/articleshow/110023562.cms,"India on Friday voted in favour of a draft UN General Assembly resolution that said Palestine is qualified and should be admitted as full member of the United Nations and recommended that the Security Council ""reconsider"" the matter ""favourably"".The 193-member General Assembly met in the morning for an emergency special session where the Arab Group resolution 'Admission of new Members to the United Nations', in support of the State of Palestine's full membership in the UN, was presented by the United Arab Emirates, as Chair of the Arab Group in May.The resolution got 143 votes in favour, including by India, nine against and 25 abstentions. The UNGA hall broke into an applause after the vote was cast.The resolution determined that ""the State of Palestine is qualified for membership in the United Nations"" in accordance with Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations and ""should therefore be admitted to membership in the United Nations"".It recommended that the Security Council ""reconsider the matter favourably, in the light of this determination"".India was the first non-Arab State to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organisation as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974. India was also one of the first countries to recognise the State of Palestine in 1988 and in 1996, Delhi opened its Representative Office to the Palestine Authority in Gaza, which was later shifted to Ramallah in 2003.Earlier this month, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj had said that while Palestine's application for membership at the UN was not approved by the Security Council because of the veto in the UNSC, ""I would like to state here at the very outset that in keeping with India's long-standing position, we hope that this would be reconsidered in due course and that Palestine's endeavour to become a member of the United Nations will get endorsed"".An annex to the resolution said that the additional rights and privileges of participation of the State of Palestine will be effective as of the 79th session of the General Assembly that begins in September this year.These include the right to be seated among member states in alphabetical order; the right to make statements on behalf of a group, including among representatives of major groups; the right of members of the delegation of the State of Palestine to be elected as officers in the plenary and the Main Committees of the General Assembly and the right to full and effective participation in UN conferences and international conferences and meetings convened under the auspices of the General Assembly.Palestine, in its capacity as an observer state, does not have the right to vote in the General Assembly or to put forward its candidature to UN organs.In April, Palestine had sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres requesting that its application for full UN membership be considered again. For a state to be granted full UN membership, its application must be approved both by the Security Council and the General Assembly, where a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting is required for the state to be admitted as a full member.Last month, the US had vetoed a resolution in the Security Council on the Palestinian bid to be granted full membership of the United Nations. The 15-nation Council had voted on a draft resolution that would have recommended to the 193-member UN General Assembly ""that the State of Palestine be admitted to membership in the United Nations"".The resolution got 12 votes in its favour, with Switzerland and the UK abstaining and the US casting its veto. To be adopted, the draft resolution required at least nine Council members voting in its favour, with no vetoes by any of its five permanent members - China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States.Currently, Palestine is a ""non-member observer state"" at the UN, a status granted to it by the General Assembly in 2012. This status allows Palestine to participate in proceedings of the world body but it cannot vote on resolutions. The only other non-member observer state at the UN is the Holy See, representing the Vatican.","The 193-member General Assembly met in the morning for an emergency special session.

"With 3D-printed rocket engine, Isro adds another feather to cap",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-3d-printed-rocket-engine-isro-adds-another-feather-to-cap/articleshow/110019883.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro has added another feather to its cap with the successful hot testing of a liquid rocket engine manufactured using additive manufacturing - or 3D printing - technology on May 9, the space agency said Friday.The engine, designated for use in the PS4, is used in the upper stage of Isro's workhorse rocket, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle .Isro redesigned the conventionally manufactured PS4 engine to make it compatible with additive manufacturing techniques. It said this innovative approach, known as Design for Additive Manufacturing, has yielded remarkable advantages.""The Laser Powder Bed Fusion technique employed in the manufacturing process reduced the number of engine components from 14 to a single piece, eliminating 19 weld joints. This streamlined design not only significantly reduced raw material usage per engine from 565kg to a mere 13.7kg of metal powder but also cut overall production time by 60%,"" Isro said.The PS4 engine, which uses a bipropellant combination of nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer and monomethyl hydrazine as the fuel, was developed by Isro's Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre. The manufacturing of the additively manufactured engine was carried out by the Indian industry partner, Wipro 3D , while the hot testing was conducted at Isro's Propulsion Complex in Mahendragiri.""Prior to the successful 665-second hot test, Isro conducted a comprehensive development programme that included detailed flow and thermal modelling, structural simulations, cold flow characterization of the proto hardware, and four successful developmental hot tests of the integrated engine for a cumulative duration of 74 seconds. These rigorous tests validated the engine's performance parameters,"" Isro said. The successful hot-testing of the 3D-printed PS4 helps leverage additive manufacturing technology for rocket engines in the future, said Isro. ""This paves the way for the induction of the additively manufactured PS4 engine into the regular PSLV programme, ushering in a new era of advanced manufacturing techniques for India's space endeavours,"" it added.","The engine, designated for use in the PS4, is used in the upper stage of Isro's workhorse rocket, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.

An Assistant Minister ranked official, Xu, 60, appointed by Chinese President Xi Jinping for the sensitive job, said he regards his posting in New Delhi as an ""honourable mission and a sacred duty"" to improve and advance the bilateral ties.""It is an honourable mission and a sacred duty.

He is currently China's Vice Foreign Minister.Xu's appointment comes after an unusually long delay of 18 months amid strained relations between the two countries over the Ladakh military standoff.Relations between the two countries hit a low except for trade ever since the eastern Ladakh border standoff erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong Tso (lake) area. The two sides have so far held 21 rounds of Corps Commander-level talks to resolve the standoff.India is pressing the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to disengage from the Depsang and Demchok areas, maintaining that there cannot be restoration of normalcy in its relations with China as long as the state of the borders remains abnormal.According to the Chinese military, the two sides so far agreed to disengage from four points, namely the Galwan Valley, the Pangong Lake, Hot Springs, and Jianan Daban (Gogra).As he set to take over his posting in New Delhi, Xu was candid and hopeful about resolving the present deadlock in bilateral ties.""I noted Prime Minister Modi's comments on the importance of China-India ties , and the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson responded to that right afterwards,"" Xu said.In his recent interview with Newsweek magazine, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India's relationship with China is important and significant.""The Chinese side always believes that China-India ties should not be defined by any single issue or area; the boundary question is not the entirety of the relationship. Speaking at the Indian Council of World Affairs in September 2014, President Xi Jinping said that we must not focus our attention only on differences and forget about our friendship and cooperation, still less should we allow the differences to stand in the way of our development and interfere with the overall growth of bilateral relations,"" Xu said.On how he viewed his appointment after a considerable hiatus, Xu said, ""It is my great honour to be appointed by His Excellency President Xi Jinping as the 17th Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of India"".""I look forward to, and I trust that I will have, the support and assistance from the Indian government and friends from all sectors as I work to perform my ambassadorial duties,"" he said.Xu also said cooperation and coordination between India and China on global and regional affairs would not only bring opportunities to both but also have an ""important positive impact"" on a reasonable international order.The world today is experiencing profound changes unseen in a century. ""We face multiple global challenges such as climate change, food and energy crises, weak economic recovery and so on,"" Xu said.""Closer communication and coordination on global and regional affairs will not only bring opportunities to both countries and the world but also add stability and positivity to international relations.

Jageshwar has been working for the Birhor tribal community since 1989 in the village of Bhithghara located among the mountains and forests in the Bagicha block.For this purpose, he set up an ashram in Jashpur district. Additionally, he made vigorous efforts by organizing camps to eliminate illiteracy and offer healthcare services to the people.Jageshwar was previously recognized with the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Award in 2015 for his exceptional contributions.

Since childhood, he had seen the suffering of the Birhor tribe. During that period, the Birhor tribal community residing in dense forests lacked access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities. Jageshwar made a decision to improve their lives.He began by residing among the tribal people initially. He acquired knowledge of their language and culture. Subsequently, he inspired the aspiration for education and promoted the enrollment of children in schools. Due to his endeavors, vaccination facilities were established during the Corona pandemic. Furthermore, aid was extended to decrease infant mortality rates.Due to the efforts of Jageshwar Yadav, the children belonging to the Birhor tribe are now attending school. In the past, the Birhor tribal community and their children kept to themselves and did not interact with outsiders. They would flee when they saw people from outside their community. Even the sight of shoe marks would prompt them to hide. Attending school seemed like an unattainable dream for them. However, things have now taken a different turn.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

"Airman shot by deputy doted on little sister and aimed to buy mom a house, family says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/airman-shot-by-deputy-doted-on-little-sister-and-aimed-to-buy-mom-a-house-family-says/articleshow/110025082.cms,"FORT WALTON BEACH : Just two days before a sheriff's deputy in Florida shot him dead, US Air Force airman Roger Fortson called home to find out what his 10-year-old sister wanted for her birthday.It was a typical gesture for the 23-year-old from Atlanta , who doted on the girl and was devoted to helping her, a younger brother and his mom prosper, his family says.""He was trying to give me everything that I never could get for myself,"" his mother , Chantemekki Fortson, said Thursday at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach, where her son was living when he was killed.He was her ""gift,"" she said, the man who taught her to love and forgive and served as her co-worker and counselor.An Okaloosa County sheriff's deputy shot Fortson on May 3. Sheriff's officials say he acted in self-defense while responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex. But civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Fortson family, has accused the deputy of going to the wrong apartment and said the shooting was unjustified.The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.At Thursday's news conference, Chantemekki Fortson held a large framed portrait of her son in dress uniform. He joined the Air Force in 2019, the same year he graduated from Ronald McNair - a majority Black high school in metro Atlanta's DeKalb County where roughly half of students don't graduate in four years.Air Force service was a lifelong dream, and Fortson rose to the rank of senior airman. He was stationed at Hurlburt Field near Fort Walton Beach.""Where we come from, we don't end up where Roger ended up,"" his mother said.Fortson, a gunner aboard the AC-130J, earned an Air Medal with combat device, which is typically awarded after 20 flights in a combat zone or for conspicuous valor or achievement on a single mission. An Air Force official said Fortson's award reflected both - completing flights in a combat zone and taking specific actions during one of the missions to address an in-flight emergency and allow the mission to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that had not been made public.But his service, like almost everything else he did, had a larger purpose.""He was trying to help his family have a better life,"" Crump said Thursday.That meant serving as a role model for his 16-year-old brother, his mom said, saving up to try to buy her a house, and getting her a new car. His nickname was ""Mr. Make It Happen.""Chantemekki Fortson recalled that her son, then in high school, accompanied her in an ambulance to the hospital when she was giving birth to her daughter and tried to tell the doctor how to deliver the baby.The girl and his brother were always in his thoughts. Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons.Chantemekki Fortson said her son was injured while loading a plane and was in such severe pain he thought he would die. But he told his mom he had to push through for his brother and sister.He was also by her side when she got into an accident a short time later and needed to go to the emergency room.""That's the kind of gift he was,"" she said. ""They took something that can never be replaced.""","Roger Fortson, 23, was a gunner aboard the AC-130J.

""Please, leave me alone,"" he shouted, asking, ""What did I do wrong?"" Mucus had crusted in his beard. A pair of stained pants hung off his slender frame. ""Come on,"" a officer said as he stumbled forward, disoriented and agitated.""We've got to leave the station."" The team then handcuffed him and dragged him out of the station.The police officers were part of a team led by a medical worker whose job is to move - by force, if needed - mentally ill people, who are often homeless, out of New York City's transit system. The intervention teams are part of an expansive effort to make the subway safer after a string of shocking crimes. Part of the plan involves finding solutions to one of the transit system 's most frustrating problems: people experiencing mental health issues and homelessness living on trains and in stations.Officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates the subway, said they were doing what was necessary to help troubled people while keeping them away from passengers. In survey after survey, riders have said they would use mass transit more often if they saw fewer people behaving erratically and more cops.But some advocates for mentally ill people believe the teams use heavy-handed tactics that do more harm than good. In defence, MTA officials said that the agency's officers must sometimes restrain people who are suffering from severe psychiatric distress.Launched last fall, the programme, called Subway Co-Response Outreach, or SCOUT, has removed at least 113 people from the subway. Most go willingly to shelters, or to hospitals for medical treatment, according to transit officials.There is no data to suggest that people with mental illness are more likely than others to commit violent crimes. But some New Yorkers were put on edge by a series of high-profile attacks carried out by mentally ill homeless people in recent months.",The intervention teams are part of an expansive effort to make the subway safer after a string of shocking crimes.

"Biden Admin 'satisfied' with accountability it has demanded from India in Pannun case, says Garcetti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-admin-satisfied-with-accountability-it-has-demanded-from-india-in-pannun-case-says-garcetti/articleshow/110019620.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US is ""satisfied"" with the accountability it has demanded from India on the allegations that its officials were involved in an alleged plot to kill a Sikh separatist on American soil, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti has said. In November last year, US federal prosecutors charged Indian national Nikhil Gupta with working with an Indian government employee in the foiled plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.Pannun, wanted in India on terror charges, holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. He has been designated as a terrorist by the Union Home Ministry under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.""When I was referring to a relationship that might have bumps along the road, this would be potentially the first big fight in a relationship,"" Garcetti said in response to a question at an event organised on Thursday by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a top American think-tank.""And so far, knock on wood, I would say the administration is satisfied with the accountability that we've demanded on this, because this is a red line for America, for our citizens,"" he said.He said it was an ongoing criminal case.""There's an indictment that's been brought. And if there is any connection to State actors in that, there has to be accountability. We expect that not only from our side, but we expect India to have that accountability,"" he said.""So, there's been a commission of inquiry that India has brought together and that we expect, while we do the criminal case that is about American justice, that there need to be consequences and shared information,"" he said.""So far, one of the most difficult things you can do as an ambassador in diplomacy, I have been satisfied with what they have done. I think the administration is, but we have many steps still to go,"" Garcetti said.Garcetti appeared in a discussion with Michael Froman, the former US Trade Representative under the Obama Administration.Froman said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is about to be re-elected, which everyone is reassuming.Responding to a question on concerns being raised in certain quarters in the US about the human rights situation in India, Garcetti said this is not America's responsibility.""It is not America's responsibility to fix India. It is America's responsibility to engage with India, to promote our interests, and also to reflect our values,"" Garcetti said.""I can tell you it's very strong. I think people from the outside say, they want a strategic relationship with India, so everybody's looking the other way when it comes to human rights issues and stuff. It's actually not true,"" he said.Whether it's human rights reports or religious freedom reports, the US always discusses it with India.""For instance, there's been violence in a state called Manipur in India, where there is fighting between two different ethnic groups. I was asked in my second month or third month in India, what do you think about the violence there?""I answered...because there are some horrible images we saw, women being dragged through the streets, people being killed and shot, churches and temples being burned, said, our hearts break as human beings when we see suffering, point one,"" Garcetti said.The second point, he said that this is an Indian issue for India to resolve.""And point three is that America is here to support and help in any way if asked. It wasn't even the government in power,"" he said.""You probably haven't heard the narrative, like, that India is more advanced than us on human rights. But when it comes to transgender rights, they are,"" he said.","US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti says the US is ""satisfied"" with the accountability it has demanded from India on the alleged plot to kill a Sikh separatist on American soil.

2024 will be last election ‘decided by US citizens’: Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2024-will-be-last-election-decided-by-us-citizens-elon-musk/articleshow/110012482.cms,"NEW DELHI: Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and a prominent tech figure , recently ignited a political debate with his claim that the 2024 US presidential election could be the last to be decided by American citizens alone. This provocative statement, shared on his own social media platform X, reflects his concerns about the influence of illegal immigrants on electoral outcomes—a topic that has long been a point of contention in US politics.Musk's comment was in response to a new bill passed by House Republicans that aims to include a citizenship question in the national census, a move opposed by the White House and unanimously by Democrat legislators.As per a report in the Independent, the bill, known as the Equal Representation Act, is designed to alter how congressional seats are allocated by excluding non-citizens from the population counts used in electoral apportionment. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended the legislation, arguing that it is common sense that ""only American citizens should be counted for electoral apportionment.""This legislative change, if implemented, would potentially impact states with large immigrant populations—both Democrat and Republican-leaning—by possibly reducing their representation in Congress. Critics of the bill argue that it contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment, which mandates counting the ""whole number of persons"" in each state for census purposes. The Biden administration has expressed strong opposition to the bill, emphasizing a commitment to maintaining the census's accuracy and its historical tradition of non-political interference.Musk's statements highlight a deepening divide in American society and politics over immigration and its implications for democracy. He frames the issue as one of electoral integrity, suggesting that the Democratic Party's opposition to the bill is part of a broader strategy to increase their electoral base through immigration, thus ""disenfranchising"" US citizens. This aligns with a broader narrative among some Republicans who view immigration as a threat to the electoral process.However, this perspective is highly contested.Research and data from organizations like the American Immigration Council show that a significant portion of the US immigrant population is comprised of naturalized citizens eligible to vote, countering the argument that non-citizens are improperly influencing US elections.",Elon Musk said the 2024 US presidential election could be the last to be decided by American citizens alone.

How Rishi Sunak plans to end Putin’s hold on European energy market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-rishi-sunak-plans-to-end-putins-hold-on-european-energy-market/articleshow/109950773.cms,"Britain is set to establish Europe's first advanced nuclear fuel production facility in an ambitious move to enhance its energy security and reduce European dependence on Russian energy exports . Announcing the initiative, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared the project a strategic step to ""prise Vladimir Putin 's blood-soaked hands off Europe's energy market.""As per a Daily Mail report, the new plant, backed by a £200 million government investment, will be constructed in Cheshire at the Capenhurst site near Ellesmere Port.The facility, operated by nuclear specialist Urenco, aims to produce 10 tonnes of advanced nuclear fuel annually by the early 2030s. This fuel is crucial for the next generation of modular nuclear reactors, currently a market dominated solely by Russia.During a press briefing, Sunak highlighted the urgency of establishing a UK-based uranium enrichment plant, emphasizing that ""Russia has been the sole provider of this powerful nuclear fuel for too long and this marks the latest step in pushing him out of the energy market entirely.""The project is expected to create 400 skilled jobs and power the UK's future nuclear power plants, ensuring that other countries are less reliant on Russian advanced nuclear fuel. It's part of broader efforts to improve energy security and isolate Moscow from global energy markets, following Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Daily Mail report said.Energy secretary Claire Coutinho remarked on the significance of the new facility, noting it will fuel the new generation of advanced modular reactors necessary to quadruple the UK's nuclear capacity by 2050. Additionally, the government plans to streamline the planning process for developing nuclear fusion technology, inviting firms to compete for up to £600 million in funding to build the UK's first commercially viable fusion plant.This strategic move by the UK government not only aims to secure a future of sustainable and independent energy but also positions Britain as a leader in the global shift towards advanced nuclear technology.","Britain is set to establish Europe's first advanced nuclear fuel production facility.

Pope urges Italians to have babies as a measure of hope for future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/pope-urges-italians-to-have-babies-as-a-measure-of-hope-for-future/articleshow/110007380.cms,"ROME: Pope Francis pressed his campaign Friday to urge Italians to have children, calling for long-term policies to help families and warning that the country's demographic crisis was threatening the future. ""The number of births is the first indicator of the hope of a people,"" Francis told an annual gathering of pro-family groups. ""Without children and young people, a country loses its desire for the future.""It was Francis' latest appeal for Italy - and beyond that Europe - to invert what he has called the demographic winter facing many industrialised countries.Italy's birth rate , already one of the lowest in the world, has been falling steadily for about 15 years and reached a record low last year with 379,000 babies born.With the Vatican's strong backing, the right-wing government of Premier Giorgia Meloni has mounted a campaign to encourage at least 500,000 births annually by 2033, a rate that demographers say is necessary to prevent the economy from collapsing under the weight of Italy's aging population.Francis called for long-term political strategies and policies to encourage couples to have children, including an end to precarious work contracts and impediments to buying homes, and viable alternatives so women don't have to choose between motherhood and careers.""The problem of our world is not children being born: it is selfishness, consumerism and individualism which make people sated, lonely and unhappy,"" Francis said.Francis is expected to continue emphasising his demographic call during the upcoming 2025 Holy Year, which has hope as its main theme. In the official Jubilee decree, or papal bull, that was promulgated Thursday, Francis called for a new social covenant among Christians to encourage couples to be open to having children.","Pope Francis urges Italians to have children, calling for long-term policies to help families.

On the video several anonymous users commented, “They are very small to run that fast! I think they’re lovely.”“I think they’re cute,” said another.A third quipped, “Well that’s an extreme way to get your dogs cared for while you’re at work lol.”While these panda dogs captured some netizens heart, certain visitors accused the sanctuary of animal cruelty.Although resembling giant pandas, some observers noticed peculiar behavior, including head shaking, prompting widespread outrage when visitors discovered they were observing chow-chow dogs instead of pandas.Nevertheless, the zoo defended its choice to exhibit painted dogs instead of pandas, asserting that the dye used on the chow-chow dogs was non-harmful and consisted of non-toxic substances.An employee at the zoo informed a local news outlet, Jiangsu News, that the initiative was aimed at increasing visitor numbers and enhancing the enjoyment of the zoo experience. He explained that the zoo had not yet introduced actual pandas due to space constraints, as the facility was too small to accommodate a giant panda enclosure.In 2016, Singapore's Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) investigated a similar case involving three chow chows in the country that were dyed to resemble pandas. The owner had started a service renting out the pure-bred dogs for photo shoots but denied any cruelty. AVA stated at the time that it was examining the situation to ensure animal welfare was not compromised, but also noted that the use of safe, non-toxic food dyes was unlikely to harm the dogs, reported The Strait Times.",Two dogs with panda-like coats confused netizens when the video of a zoo in China went viral online on May 1.
