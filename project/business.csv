How India’s airlines turn delays into before-time arrival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-indias-airlines-turn-delays-into-before-time-arrival/articleshow/124081226.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

Choked airports, weather events, maintenance and staff woes, there’s much that can hold up flight operations. But carriers have a simple strategy to stay on top of flight schedules: inflating the duration of the journey

Wide margins

Bragging rights

Blame game

Depending on which airline you choose to fly, the travel time mentioned in the ticket for a Delhi-Mumbai flight can be less than two hours or stretch to almost three. How’s that possible? Most airlines fly either Boeing or Airbus planes, so they fly at roughly the same speed, more or less at the same altitude, and follow similar routes. So, how do you account for the extra one hour of flying time? That’s where OTP comes in. No, not the one-time password you are so familiar with, but On-Time Performance. Airlines, which, understandably, make a virtue out of punctuality, have long since realised that the safest way to ensure an on-time (or even before-time) performance is by inflating the journey time. That makes late arrival rather difficult.Basically, airlines do a careful calculation of all factors at play from before a plane takes off till it lands. To be fair, there are many factors an airline doesn’t control. Like bad weather or congestion on the ground and in air before landing in some choked airport like Delhi or Mumbai. Some, though, are very much the responsibility of airlines, like ensuring there are no snags and taking care of other logistical issues like making sure crew are present.Technically, a flight needs to be pushed back from the boarding gate within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure time to be counted as an on-time departure for the purpose of flight statistics, which are maintained by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The scheduled departure and arrival time of a flight is calculated keeping the historical and seasonal flying time (from getting airborne to touchdown) between the origin and destination city pairs and the taxi time at either airport. This is known as the “chocks off” to “chocks on” time, referring to the wedges placed in front and behind aircraft wheels before it is pushed back and after it lands to prevent accidental rolling when parked.“The usual Delhi-Mumbai flying time is one hour and 40 minutes. Add to that 10 minutes of taxi each at IGIA (Delhi) and CSMIA (Mumbai), giving a total time of two hours. Then, to factor in airport congestion and hovering at destination, the taxi time was increased to, from 20 to, say, 27 minutes. Some airlines added further buffer to their block time — the time an aircraft can start taxiing to the time it comes to a halt at its destination — to ensure they can announce an on-time arrival,” said one pilot. If these inflated flying times are about airlines being smart, it is also a practice that has been driven by growing competition and hectic schedules.Therefore, unless you are flying on a particularly bad weather day, or a particularly unreliable airline with poor aircraft maintenance/unpaid employees/jet fuel suppliers, or to and from particularly choked airport/s, you are unlikely to miss the boast of “another on-time arrival” on touchdown at the destination by the crew. Queries to big and upcoming airlines — Air India, IndiGo and Akasa — on this issue went unanswered.It was in 2003 that Indian skies started getting low-cost carriers (LCCs) that democratised air travel. And, with that, air traffic, terminal and runway congestion, too, became a fact of life.“About two decades back, the total travel time from Delhi to Mumbai was given as 1 hour and 55 minutes. Then, congestion checked in and planes would routinely get delayed on ground and in air. Some smart private airlines started adding a buffer to the journey time to report on-time arrivals. Soon, almost everyone started to do the same, at least on city pairs with choked airports,” said a pilot with over four decades of flying experience. Which brings us to today, when the exact same aircraft type often has different travel times on the same sector. But there’s more here than would appear obvious.Arriving ahead of or on schedule triggers a virtuous cascading effect for the airline: the plane can then operate its next flight on time as well with the same buffer for the flight after and so on. That is unless it’s caught in a big weather event like heavy rain or fog or develops a snag en-route or on landing and has to be grounded for checks and maintenance. But there are other reasons why there can be no fixed or standard travel time between two destinations common to all airlines.How long it takes to fly between any two destinations depends on a number of things, like the routings given (direct or not), weather, wind flow and airport congestion. “If an aircraft gets tailwinds, it will reach its destination faster while headwinds will slow it down. Winters see strong west-to-east jetstreams, which means an Ahmedabad-Kolkata flight could take 10-15 minutes less than the Kolkata-Ahmedabad journey and a LondonDelhi nonstop can take up to two hours less than the Delhi-London,” said a senior commander.DGCA issues monthly reports for domestic air travel that include, among other data points, OTP data of scheduled domestic airlines based on inputs from six metro airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Kolkata. This “data” is crucial for airlines to project themselves as punctual in the eyes of the domestic traveller.But tinkering with travel times is not done just for reasons of OTP. Sometimes, Indian carriers that operate long hauls, say between Delhi and London, report an under 10-hour flying time to ensure they can make do with two pilots. Reporting journey time of over 10 hours means they will have to fly with three pilots, which adds to their cost and also requires them to inform DGCA. The regulator routinely flags this issue with Indian carriers whenever it detects anomalies over under-reporting of travel time with a view to carrying fewer than required pilots.When it comes to reporting inflated travel times on domestic routes, it may suit the airline well, though it also creates several problems on ground.Airlines and operators of busy airports blame each other for air traffic congestion, which is among the potential delays factored in while inflating journey times. While airlines say delays in getting clearance for take-off from or landing at choked hubs is beyond their control, airport operators say that flights failing to operate on time upsets their slot allocation and accentuates OTP issues.“Airport slots are given per schedules filed by airlines. If airlines don’t adhere to that and planes come ahead of, or after, the time they were supposed to land, then it overlaps with the slot given to some other airline. While some mismatch is understandable depending on weather conditions and routings on a given day, what we see is significant distortion in schedules,” said a senior official at one of India’s busiest airports.But going ahead, things could improve as India is now seeing a boom in airport infra with Delhi-NCR and Mumbai MMR going to get their secondary airports and Hyderabad and Bengaluru adding to their facilities. Many constrained places like Patna and Chennai, too, will get second airports.On the airline front, India is now seeing well-funded players like IndiGo and Tata’s Air India Group along with emerging players like Akasa, Star Air and others. These airlines focus on maintaining their young fleets, which, along with added airport infra, should cut down delays to an extent that airlines don’t need to inflate travel times in a desperate bid to win brownie points with flyers.","Airlines inflate the duration of the journey to stay on top of flight schedules. Airline do a careful calculation of all factors at play from before a plane takes off till it lands. If a flight needs to be pushed back from the boarding gate within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure time, it is counted as an on- time departure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124081237,imgsize-583676,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A modern defence manufacturing facility for armoured vehicles near Casablanca in Morocco, the first such Indian private sector plant in Africa, was inaugurated by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Abdelatif Loudyi Tuesday.The facility, set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited, will produce wheeled armoured platforms (WhAP 8x8), which it has jointly designed with DRDO. Equipped with advanced mobility, protection and mission adaptability, the WhAP can be configured as an infantry fighting vehicle; armoured personnel carrier; reconnaissance, command post, mortar carrier; and even an ambulance.Singh said India’s vision of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ is not just to manufacture defence platforms and tech for its own needs, but to develop capabilities that allow the country to become a credible source of advanced technology and high-quality products for the world.“For India, self-reliance does not mean isolation. Rather, we aim to develop strategic autonomy. We want to develop capabilities that allow us to defend our nation independently, while maintaining engagement with global partners. Along with ‘Make in India’, we are pursuing ‘Make with Friends’ & ‘Make for World’,” he added.Describing the occasion as “a historic moment” in the evolving bilateral strategic partnership, Singh said Morocco’s strategic location as a gateway to Africa and Europe makes the TASL facility an important hub for exports and collaboration.Spread over 20,000 square metres, the facility will begin delivering WhAP 8x8 vehicles to Royal Moroccan Army from next month.","The facility, set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited, will produce wheeled armoured platforms (WhAP 8x8) Equipped with advanced mobility, protection and mission adaptability, the WhAP can be configured as an infantry fighting vehicle, armoured personnel carrier, reconnaissance, command post, mortar carrier and even an ambulance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124080889,imgsize-896745,width-400,resizemode-4/article-23.jpg"

Naming art gallery owner Rajesh Rajpal and lawyer Vishwang Desai, ED has alleged that Rajpal received proceeds of crime worth Rs 15.7 crore generated through the sale of fake paintings, whereas Desai acted as the sole intermediary, curating art options, negotiating terms and vouching for authenticity of the works before prospective buyers.The cartel allegedly traded in counterfeit works claiming they were by the likes of M F Husain, F N Souza and other prominent artists.The chargesheet also names Abhishek Jain, Manish Sakariya and Rare Art Gallery Pvt Ltd, saying Jain and Sakariya assisted in layering the proceeds of crime.According to the chargesheet, the accused had prepared forged certificates of authenticity and provenance of paintings, including an unsigned certificate pertaining to a painting allegedly by F N Souza, and duped a businessman buyer, who is the complainant in the case.ED's money laundering case is based on a cheating case registered at Tardeo police station in 2024.Earlier, the police had filed a closure report in the case, terming the dispute as being of 'civil nature' since the accused had returned Rs 2.2 crore to the complainant from the total money he received. However, the magistrate's court rejected the report and ordered police further investigation against Rajpal and Desai.ED claimed that by creating and circulating fabricated documents, Desai enabled Rajpal to misrepresent forged artworks as genuine, thereby inducing the complainant to part with Rs 15.7 crore through banking channels. Subsequently, some of this amount was withdrawn, with no clarity on its recipient or use.ED asserted that Desai's role extended beyond generating the proceeds of crime to projecting them as untainted property in Rajpal's hands. Although ED was unable to find a money trail directly linking it to Desai, it maintained that his active connivance and deliberate assistance allowed Rajpal to integrate and layer the illicit funds into the financial system under the guise of genuine art sales.","The cartel allegedly traded in counterfeit works claiming they were by the likes of M F Husain, F N Souza and other prominent artists.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has reportedly halted the issuance of tourist and work visas temporarily for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a comprehensive travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working without issue in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also closely aligns with broader efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification measures, and fully digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working diligently to overhaul its immigration systems to significantly reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent.

A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to Centre and the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) on a plea seeking an independent, fair and expeditious probe.The bench examined the July 12 preliminary report, which suggested lapses on the part of pilots in the Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who is representing the aviation safety NGO, Safety Matters Foundation led by Captain Amit Singh (FRAeS), contended that three members of the probe panel were from the aviation regulator, raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns.He also urged the court to order the release of the flight data recorder (FDR) information to clarify the cause of the accident.The plea highlighted that AAIB's preliminary report attributed the accident to the fuel cutoff switches being moved from ""run"" to ""cutoff,"" effectively implying pilot error.The plea also alleged that the report withholds critical information, including the full Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) output, complete Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts with time stamps and Electronic Aircraft Fault Recording (EAFR) data.The Apex Court highlighted concerns over confidentiality, privacy, and dignity, while recognizing the necessity for a final report. It cautioned that disclosing certain details could be misused by competing airlines, but emphasized that its notices were solely aimed at ensuring a fair, independent, and impartial investigation.","The Supreme Court on Monday raised serious concerns over the AAIB preliminary report on the June 12 Air India Crash.

Khalistani Outfit Threatens To 'Siege' Indian Consulate In Vancouver; Targets New Envoy

Gosal allegedly planned violence at Indian consulates in Canada

Inderjit Singh Gosal, who took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing, is learned to have been arrested by Canadian police. Gosal is also the Canada coordinator for terror group Sikhs for Justice and has links with Babbar Khalsa International, also a designated terror outfit.The action comes shortly after India's national security adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart, Nathalie Drouin, held talks in Delhi last week.The arrest - made on multiple firearms charges - signals a shift from Canada's previous approach.Gosal was also an accused in the case of violence at the temple in the Greater Toronto Area last year but was let off after a brief detention. Ties nosedived after the killing of Nijjar, a wanted terrorist, as former Canadian PM Justin Trudeau accused Indian agencies of masterminding it. In Oct last year, India said it was pulling out its high commissioner and five other diplomats due to Ottawa's attempt to link them to the Nijjar case. It also expelled many Canadian diplomats.Gosal came to the forefront of anti-India activities in Canada and campaigned aggressively for Khalistan referendum. Multiple instances of confrontations were reported as pro-Khalistan activists sought to get other Sikhs to sign off on their secessionist agenda.Gosal even acted as one of the personal security officers to SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu during his visits to Canada. He was also allegedly involved in the planning of the violence at Indian consulate establishments in Canada.A few months ago, he had revealed that Canadian police had asked him to be ""careful"" against a possible hit. Canadian police had also subsequently claimed that Gosal was among the 13 citizens of the country who were targets of criminal violence aimed at pro-Khalistan elements. ""As a result of being the organiser of Khalistan referendum, I am facing an imminent threat to my life from the agents and proxies of the govt of India but I have to continue. .."" he told a Canadian new website.","Inderjit Singh Gosal took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.

Poll Do you think the criticism of Bengaluru's road conditions by industry leaders and opposition parties is justified? Yes, they have a valid point No, it's exaggerated

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday wrote to Wipro founder Azim Premji seeking the IT giant’s support in tackling traffic congestion on Bengaluru’s Outer Ring Road (ORR). The letter comes amid growing criticism from industry leaders and opposition parties over the city’s crumbling road infrastructure.In his letter, Siddaramaiah praised Wipro’s role in Karnataka’s development but flagged severe congestion at the Iblur junction, particularly during peak hours. He suggested that opening limited vehicular movement through Wipro’s campus, under agreed terms and security checks, could significantly ease the problem.“One of the key challenges currently facing Bengaluru, particularly along the Outer Ring Road corridor at Iblur junction is severe traffic congestion during peak hours, which adversely impacts mobility, productivity, and the quality of urban life,” Siddaramaiah wrote.Citing expert assessments, he added: “Preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicate that such a measure could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30%, particularly during peak office hours.Your support in this matter will go a long way in easing traffic bottlenecks, enhancing commuter experience, and contributing to a more efficient and livable Bengaluru.”The chief minister urged Wipro’s management to work with state officials to find a “mutually acceptable plan at the earliest.”The appeal comes against the backdrop of heightened public debate on Bengaluru’s infrastructure. Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai and Biocon Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw recently urged the government to act after logistics platform BlackBuck shifted operations out of Bellandur, citing poor commuting conditions.Meanwhile, deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has defended the government, saying the pothole problem is not unique to Karnataka. “It is there across the country, including in Delhi. Projecting in the media as if the issue is only here is not right,” he told reporters. He added that civic teams are filling around a thousand potholes daily despite heavy rains.With the opposition BJP set to stage a statewide road blockade protest on 24 September, the ruling Congress faces mounting pressure to show quick progress on improving Bengaluru’s roads.",Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah wrote to Wipro founder Azim Premji seeking the IT giant's support in tackling traffic congestion on Bengaluru's Outer Ring Road.

President Trump spoke against quarterly results. Some say they create unnecessary pressure. Do you belong to that camp?





Jamie Dimon, chairman & CEO of the world's largest bank, visited India to address global business leaders and investors at JP Morgan's 10th annual India conference. Impressed by Mumbai's coastal road during his visit, Dimon, in an exclusive interview to TOI, discussed tariffs, H-1B visas, market risks, and stressed the impact of free trade, geopolitical tensions involving Russia and India, and US policies on global talent and investment flows.I'm in the free-trade camp other than with regards to national security such as AI, chips, rare earths, and things like that. There's also long-standing unfair trade, where industries get protected and political forces resist change. I hope President Trump and Prime Minister Modi, who seem to respect each other, can reach an agreement.I see India as a natural friend of America. I don't think we need to ask you to align; we should extend our hand and build relationships. The war in Ukraine has created big problems - for China, for America - and we feel strongly that Russia is doing bad things and must be stopped. Trade will feel the pressure from that.Your trade with America isn't extraordinary, and many tariffs have been exempted, so it's not as simple as people say.It happened over a weekend, mostly misinformation at first.The clarification was that it applies only to new H-1Bs, not the existing ones. That was my first concern.Too early to say. There are between 85,000 and 140,000 H-1B visas issued each year, and the HIRE Act is still at a very early stage. We'll be engaging with stakeholders and policymakers. For us, visas matter because we move people around globally - experts who get promoted to new jobs in different markets.I'm not sure. It came out of the blue. I haven't spoken to another business leader about it.I think tariffs are modestly inflationary. I'm not sure they're just a one-time effect. Some people say that, but in reality they'll come in pieces, not all at once. If they did come in immediately, you'd see a quick spike up and then down. All things being equal, it's a little recessionary, but really just one straw on the camel's back.The global economy is huge, and even US trade isn't that big a factor. China is now a much larger trading partner than most others. So, will it cause a recession? Hard to say. But many - including some govts - believe that new spending almost offsets the impact. If tariffs cost $400 billion, you've also got $400 billion of additional, front-loaded spending from the so-called ""big, beautiful bill"".Asset prices and credit spreads are high by almost any measure. That doesn't mean they must go down, but higher prices are riskier than lower prices. Not everyone would agree with that, but that's how I see it.Short rates at 4% are high; with 2% inflation they should be closer to 3.5%. 10-year yields are around 4%, which is about right unless there's a major recession. My bias is that inflation could be worse than expected, so long rates could drift higher.I think Fed's independence is important. Even President Trump said that recently. He has the right to strongly voice his opinion, which he does. He's not the only president who has ever done that. But I don't think the rhetoric helps. But that's not going to stop the President from saying whatever he wants.Since I've been coming here, you've accomplished Aadhaar, which I think is an unbelievable achievement. You also carried out a second round of GST reforms, which I think are excellent. Those kinds of changes matter because outdated systems can cripple commerce.You launched a national infrastructure program under Prime Minister Modi. That's important, because you need sustained investment in infrastructure.So, I think the reforms here are excellent, and the fact that your prime minister was able to get them done shows strong leadership. He's been a successful prime minister. And you're seeing similar shifts elsewhere: Prime Minister Starmer in the UK, Scholz in Germany, Macron in France, Meloni in Italy. They all want growth and investment, and they understand that being completely anti-business and anti-investment is not a good strategy for growing an economy.Consumers still have jobs but they have run out of Covid savings, so it's back to normal. Lower-income households are having to make decisions and they are cutting back on trips away or eating at home rather than in restaurants. Credit has declined, but only to pre-Covid levels. The real risk would come with a recession. Commercial credit is also normalising. Credit losses have gone up, but it's at what I would consider a more normal rate.My biggest worry is that 30 years from now, we may read a book titled 'How the West Was Lost'. It could describe how, starting with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and terrorism in the Middle East, Iran, Russia, North Korea - with some help from China - were able to dismantle the post-World War II order of law and stability. That system had been quite successful, and you benefited from it too. In this scenario, the world fragments into competing power blocs and bilateral alliances, resembling the pre-WWI or pre-WWII era, where every nation has to figure out how to protect itself. And in that environment, the strongest nation - China - could leave others acting as its vassals.Yes, and we don't teach enough of it. India has done great, and I'm very optimistic about its future - with education and strong leadership under your Prime Minister. The economy has been growing at 6%, and that could and should continue for 20 years. The bigger caveat is the world order: India has benefited from a peaceful global system, even as you face your own local challenges.People have been talking about the end of globalisation for years, but it never really happens. It slows down occasionally, and sometimes even reverses along certain trade routes. But I don't believe globalisation itself is going away. If you look at the trade numbers, they haven't really declined. They dipped a little a couple of years ago, but overall, I don't see the end of globalisation.The nicest thing is the highway from the airport to Mumbai - it really makes a difference. When I first came to India, around 2005 our office was an old building in downtown Mumbai. The elevator barely held three people. Back then, we did research on about 20 companies with 10 investment bankers. Today we have over 55,000 people in India critically involved in engineering, cyber, AI, and a full range of services that support the US and global operations. Investment banking has grown too. We now research almost 200 companies globally and serve Indian companies here and abroadThe Indian stock market is worth around $5 trillion now; I expect it could reach $20 trillion in 20 years. This enormous growth mirrors what we see across other companies and sectors, like Tata and TCS.It's very likely as long as we continue to do a great job for our clients. That's inevitable. But stock prices are high, and I think it is true for our stock also. So it may be a while, but it'd be nice. But that's predicated upon me continuing to build a great company.Here's some good news. When I travel around the world now, there's a strong tech diaspora. We have a tech conference in Paris, we're building a tech centre in Berlin, and India has a huge amount of homegrown tech. It's positive that the rest of the world is becoming more competitive in technology, innovation, and growth. That's good for the world-more competition with America benefits everyone.The challenge is that the US still needs to remain an attractive destination. Some policies may make a few people a bit hesitant, but only at the margin. We should remain a very welcoming country. My grandparents were Greek immigrants who never finished high school. America is an immigrant nation, and that's part of its core strength.I wouldn't say we've changed it. My earlier views were mostly about bitcoin. We are big users of blockchain - we built it, and we have the JP Morgan Coin on a blockchain, which is a 24/7 deposit. We're developing use cases and plan to launch a stablecoin.To me, a stablecoin is like a mutual fund. Laws haven't been written yet, but it would follow the same disclosure, AML, and BSA rules. There will be use cases for a US dollar stablecoin - some Indians or others around the world may want to hold dollars rather than local currency, and it could facilitate cross-border payments. But I don't see it replacing cash. Money already moves quickly, safely, and cheaply. For a business, if I send you a stablecoin, you'd likely prefer cash to invest as you wish. A stablecoin could have corporate payment uses, not consumer payments. It won't replace existing systems, it won't pay interest, and people still like earning interest. So, there's use, but it's limited.I like that he pointed it out. There is a tremendous amount of quarterly reporting that isn't worthwhile.In the US, the bigger picture is that public markets have shrunk: we've gone from 8,000 public companies to 4,000 since 1996, while private equity has grown from 1,000 to 12,000. Mortgages and half of leveraged lending have left banks. Part of this shift is due to the extraordinary cost of listing and disclosures, some of which are a waste of time and money. Litigation from quarterly earnings pressure is real-I didn't think it was a big deal before, but many CEOs feel it and may make short-term decisions they shouldn't. Activists add pressure too.We need a major effort to reinvigorate public markets, make them better and faster. Smaller companies are going public, which is good, but they can't always afford full NYSE listing or SEC compliance. We've reduced some research burdens for them, and I think more reforms like this are needed. President Trump is pointing out a real problem.","Jamie Dimon, chairman & CEO of the world's largest bank, visited India to address global business leaders and investors at JP Morgan's 10th annual India conference.

TACO Storm: MAGA Torches Trump Over $100K H-1B Fee Backtrack, Calls Him ‘Weak’

What was the H-1B fee hike announcement?



To be clear:

1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.

2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter.

H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation.

3.) This applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders.

It will first apply in the next upcoming lottery cycle.





The White House clarification on the hikes $100,000 H1-B visa fee being only for new applicants and not for existing holders, along with the announcement that it was a one-time fee, rather than an annual cost brought a sigh of relief in the Indian IT sector.According to an ET report, the External Affairs Ministry engaged intensively during the weekend with the Donald Trump administration regarding H-1B fees concerns, following the initial announcement that could have affected core India-US relations.Following discussions in both New Delhi and Washington, the White House issued a statement clarifying that the one-time fees would apply solely to new H-1B applicants. Sources were quoted as saying that during these talks, officials emphasised the significant economic value that H1B visa-holders bring to the American economy.Officials also confirmed that India continues its dialogue with the Trump administration on this matter. Additionally, various industry associations have also communicated their perspectives to US officials regarding the H-1B announcement.The White House provided significant clarity by confirming that the one-time fee of $100,000 would affect only new H1B applicants, which helped ease concerns across the technology sector.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's announcement on Friday, September 19, regarding significant fee increases generated initial uncertainty. He said that a $100,000 annual fee would apply to H-1B visas.The announcement, which suggested annual payments for both new and renewal applications, initially caused distress among current H1B workers concerned about additional payment requirements.The announcement triggered widespread anxiety amongst Indian H1B visa holders in the US. American legislators criticised it as ""reckless"", whilst many visa holders cancelled their travel arrangements just before departing for India, and those already in India rushed to return. Organisations also raised alerts for H1B visa holders and their families who were abroad for professional or leisure purposes.Also Read | Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike to backfire? Wall Street banks set to rely more on Indian GCCs; may deepen presence in India ""H1B holders have historically become the architects of innovation, founding companies that generate hundreds of thousands of American jobs and contribute billions in tax revenue to federal, state, and local governments,"" nonprofit organisation Indiaspora posted on X.With India receiving 71% of H1B visa approvals last year, followed by China at 11.7%, it remained the primary beneficiary. Although immediate concerns have subsided, lower-salaried H1B visa holders may face increased challenges in the future.Subsequently, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued an extensive clarification saying:Also Read | The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs - winners and losers","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's announcement on Friday, September 19, regarding significant fee increases generated initial uncertainty.

Testimonials from international statesmen

Words that outlive deeds





King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia , was not only a unifier of tribes and territories but also a statesman of deep intellect, cultural appreciation, and enduring strategic foresight. As the Kingdom commemorates its 95th National Day, his legacy continues to be studied, not just in the context of nation-building, but also for the values and systems he rooted in Saudi society — education, governance, diplomacy, and cultural development.King Abdulaziz began shaping the modern Saudi state by focusing on infrastructure and basic services that could support a unified nation. Under his leadership:Despite never traveling beyond the Arab world, King Abdulaziz displayed a deep understanding of international relations. He met with numerous foreign leaders and diplomats, earning their admiration for his:The monarch also placed significant importance on education and intellectual growth. Even during the nation’s unification phase, he emphasized that the future of the Kingdom would depend on an educated and responsible generation. In a notable 1931 address to students, he remarked that “knowledge without action is like a tree without fruit,” urging youth to pursue excellence and take pride in their contributions to society.King Abdulaziz's personal dedication to knowledge was evident in his:Recognizing the importance of spreading knowledge across society, he also played a key role in developing the publishing sector:During his reign, around 100 books were printed and distributed, totaling over 100,000 copies, with some translated into non-Arabic languages — a remarkable output for a newly unified nation.Throughout his remarkable reign, King Abdulaziz left a lasting impression on observers both within the Arab world and abroad. His unique combination of humility, strength, and clarity of strategic vision resonated deeply with foreign dignitaries, regional leaders, and his own people.British explorer and political advisor John Philby, who spent years in the Arabian Peninsula, described King Abdulaziz as a leader of rare vision and resilience. Philby highlighted his determination not just to build a nation, but to ground it in faith, social order, and lasting institutions.Similarly, American diplomats visiting Saudi Arabia during the 1930s and 1940s noted his commanding presence and strategic thinking. Despite his simple lifestyle, they were impressed by his diplomatic skill, hospitality, and the loyalty he inspired across tribal and regional divides. Reports sent to Washington emphasized his ability to negotiate firmly yet respectfully, underscoring his role as a statesman of global interest.In the Arab world, King Abdulaziz was recognized as a restorer of dignity and stability. During a time when much of the region was under colonial strain, his success in uniting diverse tribes into one sovereign state was hailed as a rare and transformative achievement.Arab intellectuals and leaders saw in him a protector of Islamic identity and a model of regional leadership. His success in state-building was viewed as not only political but deeply cultural and religious in essence.In Saudi Arabia, poets preserved the memory of King Abdulaziz through verses that celebrated his qualities:These poems, often recited in traditional gatherings, served both as cultural records and as tributes to a leader who restored order after years of conflict.World leaders who met King Abdulaziz during his later years often commented on the blend of humility and authority that defined his persona. Though physically imposing and visibly marked by past battles, he spoke with measured clarity and purpose.His reputation for keeping promises and honoring diplomatic agreements became a cornerstone of his international legacy. Whether engaging with neighboring rulers or Western governments, his word was viewed as binding — a quality that set him apart on the world stage.Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, once noted that King Abdulaziz’s legacy extends beyond his political victories and includes the humanitarian and intellectual character he embodied.Today, as Saudis mark their National Day, the legacy of King Abdulaziz is not confined to state institutions or historical chronicles. It lives on in the memories of those who met him, the writings of those who studied him, and the testimonies of people who saw in him a leader destined to shape history.","King Abdulaziz began shaping the modern Saudi state by focusing on infrastructure and basic services.

NEW DELHI: BJP workers staged a protest in Bengaluru on Wednesday against the Congress-led state government over the city’s pothole problem.The demonstration took place in the Yelahanka area and was led by BJP MLA from Yelahanka, S.R. Vishwanath.The protests come amid criticism from some industrialists over road conditions in the city, with Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy recently calling Bengaluru ""the city of potholes.""Responding to the mounting criticism, Karnataka Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar defended the state government’s efforts, saying, ""Listening with Purpose. Acting with Impact. Every day, nearly 1,000 potholes are being filled across Bengaluru through coordinated efforts. Our workers and engineers are on the ground in all zones, ensuring both speed and quality in the repairs. This massive drive shows our government's commitment to solving long-pending civic issues. ""Shivakumar added that potholes are a national issue and alleged that Karnataka’s problem was being exaggerated:""I travelled around Delhi just a day ago. The media must review and report how many potholes are on Delhi's roads, including the road to the PM's residence.Potholes are a problem across the country. Only Karnataka's issues are being blown out of proportion.""He also appealed to Bengaluru’s business community, saying, ""I would like to tell everyone, including the big businesses in Bengaluru, that we are doing our job of filling potholes.""Blaming the previous BJP government in the state for the situation, Shivakumar said, ""If the roads had been maintained well during the BJP's period, we would not have reached this stage. They did not bother to do anything to fix the potholes, but now they are raising this issue as the elections are approaching.""Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy had earlier criticised the state government, stating, ""It is tragic that Bengaluru is now gaining infamy as the 'City of Potholes.' The Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister are responsible for this disgrace. Today, Bengaluru and Karnataka are trapped in the hands of the incompetent and the corrupt.""In response, Shivakumar questioned Kumaraswamy’s contributions as a Union minister, saying, ""What is Kumaraswamy's contribution to Bengaluru as a Union minister? The UPA government had given a lot of funds to Bengaluru under the Jawaharlal urban renewal mission. He is the right-hand man of the PM. Why can't he get Rs 10000 crores for Bengaluru city? He had said that he would get approvals for the Mekedatu project in 5 minutes. What happened to it?""The exchange highlights the growing political tension in Karnataka as state elections approach, with road infrastructure emerging as a flashpoint issue.","BJP workers staged a protest in Bengaluru on Wednesday against the Congress-led state government.

KOLKATA: At least eight people died in Kolkata on Tuesday as a seven-km column of cloud dumped 252mm of rain on the city in seven hours overnight. The deaths, all from electrocution and spread across the city, occurred as citizens unknowingly stepped on or touched live wires on flooded streets.The rain started around 11.30pm on Monday and ended around 6.30am on Tuesday, but the most intense spell came between 3am and 4am when Kolkata received 98mm of rain as the massive cloud build-up, caused by a low pressure, led to a deluge.To put things in perspective, Kolkata’s total annual average rainfall is 1,345mm; this means the city got almost 20% of its total yearly rainfall in the space of only seven hours. Of this, maximum rain happened in a span of three hours between 2.30am and 5.30am.Several localities in south Kolkata like Ballygunge, Jodhpur Park, Kalighat and Chetla received over 260mm of rainfall while Garia received the highest — 332mm. The intensity and volume of rain, coupled with high tide, inundated the festival-bound city, leaving it paralysed for hours. The high tide prevented water from receding till late evening.Road, rail, metro and air traffic was severely disrupted. At least 91 flights to and from the city were cancelled and 95 delayed.Several Durga Puja pandals across the city were damaged, causing heartbreak for organisers and revellers.The highest rain recorded in a day in Kolkata is 369.6mm on Sept 28, 1978, followed by 303.5mm on June 18, 1908. The city had received 236.3mm rain during cyclone Amphan on May 20, 2020.The Alipore Met office has warned of another low pressure formation over Bay of Bengal that could intensify into a depression and bring further rain later this week.“I have never seen rain like this. I feel so bad for the people who have lost their lives. It is so unfortunate,” said CM Mamata Banerjee.The electrocution deaths were reported from Ballygunge, Gariahat, Netaji Nagar, Behala, Ekbalpore, Haridevpur, Kabardanga and Beniapukur. The govt held power utility CESC responsible and asked the company to pay compensation to the families of the victims.CM Banerjee said she had spoken to CESC chairman Sanjiv Goenka. “It is so unfortunate that people have lost their lives. Their families must all be given jobs by CESC. We will also do whatever is possible to help,” she said.A CESC official said three deaths were due to electrocution from lamp posts and one from a traffic light post while five persons had died inside their homes or factories.The power supplier also switched off supply to over one lakh home till water receded. Mayor Firhad Hakim, who stood in waist-deep water supervising relief and mitigation measures, said high tide was preventing water levels from receding.“We have never seen such intense rain in so short a time. Even though we are pumping water into the canals, the water level in Hooghly has risen and the canals are overflowing. Whatever we are draining out is flowing back into the city. Until the tide recedes, we cannot say when the water will clear,” Hakim said.He added that the city’s pumping stations can discharge around 20 mm of water per hour, making it impossible to deal with 300 mm of rainfall in such a short time.The state announced Durga Puja holidays in Madhyamik board schools from Tuesday while ICSE and CBSE schools have been requested to stay shut for at least two days to tide over the situation. The CM has also requested universities to allow study/work from home.Traffic was severely disrupted throughout the day with very few buses plying and vehicles breaking down on waterlogged stretches. Metro’s Blue Line remained shut between Rabindra Sadan and Shahid Khudiram for 13 hours due to inundation of tracks. The Maidan-Dakshineswar section started at 5.38 pm. Around 300 suburban trains were cancelled and several long distance trains were rescheduled. At the airport, 87 flights were cancelled and over 71 delayed.A day after reporting frenzied buying, shops across the city stayed shut.

“The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.

Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,”

Why it matters now





The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos. The massive hike in the H-1B visa fees rattled the tech industry. Many of the tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Amazon asked the professionals on H-1B visa to return to the US by September 21. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. Many on the popular beneficiaries of the visa system have not yet voiced their opinion on this new change. However, amidst this visa fee hike an old post of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has surfaced online. In the post being shared online Musk can be seen speaking in favour of the H-1B visa system.In a fiery exchange on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk has credited the visa program for allowing his journey and also for powering America’s tech dominance.Musk wrote.Musk also went ahead and vowed to ‘go to war’ in order to defend the system against its critics. He argued that the skilled immigrants were important to US innovation and competitiveness.wrote Elon Musk.The resurfacing of this old post by Elon Musk comes at a crucial time for Indian professionals in the US, who make up nearly three-quarters of H-1B recipients. With the new $100,000 fee, the economics of hiring foreign talent have been upended, sparking fears of layoffs, relocations, and a potential reverse migration back to India.Musk’s past words — contrasting with his more recent criticisms of the program as “broken” — highlight the tensions between business needs, political rhetoric, and immigration realities.","The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos.

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Impact of H-1B fee hike on US tech and economy





The H-1B visa, introduced by the United States in 1990, has long been a pathway for highly skilled professionals from across the globe to contribute to America’s technology sector. Many of today’s tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella, entered the US through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact. These visas have been instrumental in building Silicon Valley and advancing AI, cloud computing, and consumer technology. With the recent $100,000 fee imposed on new H-1B applicants, it’s more important than ever to recognise the pivotal role these H-1B holders have played in shaping the US tech ecosystem.Musk initially entered the US on a J-1 exchange visa and later obtained an H-1B to pursue academic training and business ventures. He has been central to the success of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and X Corp, employing thousands of engineers and professionals globally. Musk credits the H-1B programme for enabling him and other highly talented individuals to create groundbreaking technologies, from reusable rockets to mass-market electric vehicles.His advocacy for skilled immigration highlights the importance of global talent in driving innovation and maintaining America’s leadership in tech.Pichai came to the US as an international student before transitioning to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google in product management roles. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai’s leadership has guided Google through major technological shifts, expanding AI research, cloud services, and consumer applications, positioning Google as a global technology leader.Nadella moved to the US in the early 1990s and obtained an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft. Rising through the ranks, he became CEO in 2014, leading Microsoft’s transformation through cloud computing, AI, and enterprise solutions. Nadella emphasises the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, highlighting that many of Microsoft’s most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through H-1B.Srinivas arrived in the US as a student and leveraged his H-1B visa to work in AI research. He later founded Perplexity AI, a company valued at $9 billion, offering cutting-edge AI solutions globally. His journey highlights the link between skilled immigration and leadership in next-generation technology.Yuan, a Chinese immigrant, faced multiple visa rejections before securing his H-1B to enter the US. He founded Zoom, which became an essential tool for global communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting millions of remote workers, schools, and enterprises. Yuan’s story demonstrates how H-1B visas enable entrepreneurs to build companies that have a global impact.Bansal came to the US on an H-1B visa in 2000 and founded AppDynamics, a software monitoring company. AppDynamics grew rapidly and was acquired for $3.7 billion, creating significant employment opportunities and boosting the tech ecosystem. Bansal’s entrepreneurial success underscores the value H-1B holders bring to innovation and economic growth.Arvind Krishna, who moved to the US from India on an H-1B visa, is the current Chairman and CEO of IBM, exemplifying how skilled immigration drives innovation. Born in Dehradun, India, he earned a B.Tech from IIT Kanpur and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Joining IBM in 1990, Krishna rose through leadership roles in research, cloud, and cognitive software, playing a pivotal role in IBM’s $34 billion Red Hat acquisition. Since becoming CEO in 2020, he has steered the company toward AI, hybrid cloud, and quantum technologies, while contributing patents and advancing global tech research.H-1B holders have been vital in founding, running, and scaling technology companies, filling high-skilled roles, driving innovation, and creating trillions in market value. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Indian-origin firms like TCS rely on these visas to access global talent that fuels growth and competitiveness in the tech industry. These skilled professionals are often the backbone of innovation hubs and help maintain the US’s global leadership in technology. Their contributions extend beyond tech, impacting research, education, and economic growth nationwide.The recent $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications has caused global concern, with tech leaders warning that such measures could limit access to skilled talent and slow innovation. Despite these hurdles, H-1B holders continue to demonstrate their vital role in shaping America’s technology landscape, proving that skilled immigrants remain essential to the country’s innovation and economic strength. H-1B holders aren’t just numbers on a visa list—they’re the people behind the apps, tools, and tech we use every day. Their creativity and skills keep America’s tech ecosystem buzzing and competitive on a global scale.","Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive' Many of today’s tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella, entered the US through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124037298,imgsize-52238,width-400,resizemode-4/h-1b-visa-success-stories-elon-musk-sundar-pichai-and-other-h-1b-visa-holders-who-shape-the-future-of-the-us-tech-industry.jpg"
