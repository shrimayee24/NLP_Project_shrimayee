Looking at the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, your party was not able to agree on seat-sharing policies with your alliance partner Mamata Banerjee-led TMC. You also have partners like Hindutva-based Shiv Sena. If elected, how would you effectively run a government with such a divided coalition which does not seem to agree on anything except for the removal of the Prime minister Modi"", the student asked.Rahul, addressing the larger issue of the alliance ’s vision, was quick to correct, “INDI is BJP’s framing, it’s INDIA alliance,” he said.However, the persistent student then questioned what the “A” in INDIA stood for.The brief silence then followed from Rahul. After a pause, he replied that “A” stood for “Alliance,” a moment that seemed to throw the crowd off balance.The student further asked whether it wouldn’t make it redundant to call it the INDIA alliance.Rahul did manage to clarify the ideological foundation of the INDIA bloc. “No, it’s not redundant because the whole idea of the alliance was to put across to the people of India that India is being attacked,” he said, bringing the conversation back to what the alliance stands for, describing it as a united front to challenge BJP’s monopolization of power.Critics from the ruling party were quick to pounce, painting the moment as a representation of the opposition’s broader internal confusion.This comes amid a row over Rahul's remarks where he said that today the ""fight in India is whether a Sikh person will be able to wear his turban, kada, and visit Gurdwara"".","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi at the center of an unexpected candid exchange with a student about the opposition’s much-touted ‘ INDIA Alliance ’ The episode, which began as a straightforward question on coalition dynamics, quickly transformed into a moment that went viral on social media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113231415,imgsize-502422,width-400,resizemode-4/113231415.jpg"
Rahul Gandhi says freedom of faith shrinking; BJP recalls 1984,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-says-freedom-of-faith-shrinking-bjp-recalls-1984/articleshow/113239573.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress functionary Rahul Gandhi told the Indian diaspora in the US that the fight at home wasn't about politics but whether Sikhs, and adherents of other faiths, will be able to practise their religion with freedom.At a convention of Indians in Washington, the Congress functionary said the ""idea of Modi"" - 56 inches and direct connection with God - has disappeared in a jiffy, and people are no longer scared of PM Modi after the 2024 Lok Sabha results.Stressing on his now established refrain of threat to religious minorities under the Modi govt, Rahul singled out a Sikh member in the audience and asked him his name, who replied Bhalender Singh. He then said, ""Fight (in India) is not about politics. That is superficial. The fight is about whether... he (Bhalender) as a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India, wear a Kada in India, or be able to go to a gurdwara, that's what the fight is about, and not just for him, for all religions... the fight is about what type of India we are going to have.""Responding to a question on reservations and how long it would continue, Rahul said, ""We will think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place. And India is not a fair place. When you look at the financial numbers, tribals get 10 paise out of Rs 100, Dalits get Rs 5 out of Rs 100, and OBCs get a similar number. The fact of the matter is that they're not getting participation.""Rahul jibed that post-2024 polls, people stop him on the roads and tell him that their fear has vanished. He laughed while it took BJP years to spread the scare through agencies, it disappeared in a matter of seconds.In New Delhi, Congress said it is hypocritical of BJP to criticise Rahul Gandhi for his justified comments in the US when PM Modi has been going abroad and ""insulting generations of Indians"" by saying that nothing happened in India in 60 years before 2014.Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said, "" BJP ecosystem is nervous and flailing because Rahul has spoken the plain truth. The 'Modi bubble' has burst. His politics of fear has failed, and nobody takes him or his band of cheerleaders seriously.

No progress possible now without cybersecurity: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-progress-possible-now-without-cybersecurity-amit-shah/articleshow/113243315.cms,"NEW DELHI: As fast-paced advancements in technology cause a surge in digital transactions and online activity in the country, home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday stressed on the need for all the stakeholders including Central and state law enforcement agencies, banks and internet service providers, to come together to fight the growing risk of cybercrimes with a data-driven approach and evolving counter-strategies.Addressing an event here to mark the first Foundation Day of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), Shah said I4C has an important role in bringing all the stakeholders on one platform to deal with emerging cyber threats as initiatives like ‘Digital India’ see the number of internet subscribers grow from 25 crore in March 2014 to 95 crore in March 2024 and 46% of the world’s digital transactions volume taking place in India.“In the days to come, as the country makes significant technological advancements, I4C has an important role in ensuring the security of its technology, data and vital installations....I believe that cyber security has become an important aspect of national security...the country’s progress is not possible without it,” the home minister said as he launched four new cyber security initiatives of I4C aimed at realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a ‘Cyber Safe Bharat’.Firstly, Shah dedicated the Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre (CFMC) — a national platform that will onboard major banks, financial institutions, payment aggregators, telecom service providers, IT intermediaries and law enforcement agencies for real-time action against online financial crimes — to the nation. He suggested that CFMC use Artificial Intelligence to identify the modus operandi of cyber frauds and find ways to deal with them.Shah also inaugurated the Samanvaya Platform, a one-stop portal for data repository of cybercrime, data sharing, crime mapping, data analytics, and coordination among law enforcement agencies for investigation of cybercrimes. Cyber Commandos Program that seeks to create special wing of trained commandos in the states/UTs and Central police organisations to secure digital space, with 5,000 commandos to be readied in 5 years, was also launched.The last initiative is the creation of a national-level ‘suspect registry’ of various mule account identifiers based on the national cybercrime reporting portal, and connecting state registries with it to in strengthen the fraud risk management capabilities of the financial ecosystem. Shah said the national suspect registry will help ensure that states/UTs do not work in silos.Shah said a nationwide cyber security awareness programme is on since September 1, with over 72 TV channels, 190 FM channels, cinema halls and other platforms on board. He appealed to the states to join in the campaign, particularly promoting the national cyber helpline ‘1930’ across the villages and towns.Dwelling on the new criminal laws, Shah said they incorporate provisions that give legal teeth to technology-driven initiatives and scientific methods of investigation in cases related to cyber crime, personal data safety, online harassment, sexual harassment of women and children, fake news and toolkit, and misinformation campaign, etc.Shah said over 1100 officers have been trained in cyber forensics and joint cyber coordination teams (JCCTs) set up in ‘hotspots’ like Mewat, Jamtara, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam and Guwahati. “These have been successful and shall be replicated in other centres,” said Shah.","Home minister Amit Shah stressed on the need for all the stakeholders including Central and state law enforcement agencies, banks and internet service providers, to come together to fight the growing risk of cybercrimes.

Jaishankar had said earlier this month it's ""common sense"" to scrutinise Chinese investments as there's a thin line separating economic issues from those with security implications.

"Shomie Das, headmaster of India’s trinity and tutor to King Charles, passes away at 89",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shomie-das-headmaster-of-indias-trinity-and-tutor-to-king-charles-passes-away-at-89/articleshow/113238074.cms,"NEW DELHI: Shomie Ranjan Das, the only person to have been headmaster of India’s trinity — first at Mayo College, and then Sanawar , before returning to his alma mater, the Doon School, founded by his grandfather Satish Ranjan Das — passed away in Hyderabad on Monday at the age of 89.The educationist, a legend in the Indian school system whoseinfluence extended to generations of students, and the current King of England, is survived by two sons and a daughter.His wife, Phiroza, had predeceased him.Shomie to his friends, or “Headie” affectionately to his students, was a liberal educationist who was born Aug 28, 1935. After school, he attended St Xavier’s College in Kolkata and followed up with a degree in physics at the University of Cambridge. Das then taught at Gordonstoun in the 1960s. He was a tutor and physics teacher to King Charles, then Prince of Wales, who he had described to UK’s Mail on Sunday as “the best schoolboy Macbeth” he had seen. Decades later, talk persisted of a “curry bet” that Charles had lost and owed a few quid.Many of the things he learned at Gordonstoun, described by King Charles as “Colditz in kilts”, would be put to good effect at Sanawar where he ensured privilege ended at the platform for the train to school. His students travelled 3rd class, ate stale bread and butter or doggies (ship’s biscuit) with sweet tea for Chhota Hazri, ran the mile, and were allowed Rs 7 a week, if at all.Das’ approach to education was to continue it outside the classroom, be it trekking up Chandrakhani Pass in a blizzard or sending students off to fight forest fires. His former students said he would reward intelligent curiosity with opportunity and unintelligent adventure with humour or the cane. One of his ex-students, Tushita Patel , recalled him as “delightfully light, and gentle with weaker students”. Another, Omar Abdullah , former J&K chief minster, said, “Headie showed me Halley’s Comet through a telescope in his back garden. For that reason and many more he will always be one of the greatest teachers I’ve had the privilege to know and be taught by.”He loved the outdoors, trekking, and adventure, and was a terrible shot. “His nemesis in Sanawar, ‘Cut-Lip the Monkey’, lived on to sire many more of his brood,” Abhinav Saigal, one of Das’ former students, said.Teachers who worked with him remember an individualistic man of great knowledge and greater humility. Samik Ghosh , who taught physics at Sanawar and was later headmaster of Scindia School, Gwalior, said Das would often come to the lab to help his teachers with experiments and “wasn’t above operating a copier” if the need arose. “‘Never align yourself with anybody or any group, and do what you have to do,’” is the advice Ghosh remembers receiving when he set out to be a headmaster himself.Pathways Gurgaon school director Capt Rohit S Bajaj, who was both taught by and taught under Das, described his attitude as “bold and futuristic”.The Doon School condoled his death, saying his “dedication to education, coupled with his humility and wisdom, earned him the respect of both his students and colleagues”.Mayo College, Ajmer, where he was principal from 1969 to 1974, praised his “exemplary leadership and relentless pursuit of excellence”, saying these qualities had “left an indelible mark on the institution, profoundly impacting the numerous students who had the privilege of being mentored by him”.The Lawrence School, Sanawar described Das as “an integral part” of the school from May 1974 to March 1988. “He will forever be remembered with love and respect by generations” of students, it said. “He had the ability to figure out instinctively and infallibly what was right for you as a person. This instinct was his greatest gift,” said Himmat Singh Dhillon, currently headmaster of Sanawar and a pupil of Das.","Shomie Ranjan Das, the only person to have been headmaster of India’s trinity, passed away in Hyderabad on Monday at the age of 89.

In a notification, the ministry said that if any vehicle without a valid and functional OBU enters the dedicated lanes, they will have to cough up double the user fee. A similar measure was taken when the govt had rolled out a mandatory FASTag system for toll collection.According to the amended National Highways Fee Rules, vehicles fitted with GNSS will be allowed to travel free on highways and expressways up to 20 km daily on the same section of highway. The move is aimed at facilitating movement of local people.As per the plan, NHAI will implement the GNSS-based tolling within the existing FASTag ecosystem , initially using a hybrid model where both RFID-based and GNSS-based electronic toll collection will operate simultaneously. The govt has completed the geo-fencing of nearly 1.4 lakh km of the NH network.To begin with, existing toll plazas will have two or more dedicated ‘GNSS lanes’ wherein the default position of barriers will be open for free flow of GNSS vehicles. These lanes will have advanced readers to identify vehicles fitted with GNSS devices and the exact user fee will be deducted from the FASTag wallet.Meanwhile, Indian and global technology majors including TCS, Infosys, Accenture, RailTel, TCIL, Sky Toll, Kapsch and Movyon have submitted applications to develop the system for satellite-based tolling on the country’s NH network.","The govt has set the internal target to bring the first tranche of 2,000 km of NH network under this new tolling system by April 2025.

Currently, there is no evidence of any broader risk to the public, it said in a statement.""The previously suspected case of Mpox (monkeypox) has been verified as a travel-related infection. Laboratory testing has confirmed the presence of Mpox virus of the West African clade 2 in the patient.

The patient remains clinically stable and is without any systemic illness or comorbidities,"" it added.Earlier, the Union health secretary Apurva Chandra issued an advisory to states and union territories regarding the precautionary measures, symptoms, and causes of Mpox.Chandra in the advisory asked the state/UTs to disseminate and take action on the updated CD-Alert on Mpox issued by NCDC which details surveillance strategy (including epidemiological case definitions, contact tracing etc.), list of laboratories operationalized to undertake testing, clinical management protocol, infection prevention and control practices as well as risk communication strategy.He also directed the states to review public health preparedness particularly at health facility level at the State and Districts by senior officials and identification of isolation facilities in hospitals for taking care of both suspect and confirmed cases, availability of required logistics and trained human resources in such facilities and augmentation plan. He also asked for orientation of all key stakeholders.Additionally, he in the advisory also said that while all States are requested to undertake appropriate activities to make communities aware about the disease, it is crucial that any undue panic amongst the masses is prevented.According to the advisory, Mpox primarily affects young males with a median age of 34 years, with the sexual mode of transmission being the most common, followed by person-to-person non-sexual contact. Approximately half of the cases with available information on their HIV status are reported to be in persons living with HIV. Common symptoms include rashes (including systemic or genital rash) and fever.Chandra further said that the Union ministry of health & family welfare shall continue to monitor the situation closely and will extend all requisite support to states and UTs.Since January 1, 2022, Mpox cases have been reported to the WHO from 121 member states across all six WHO regions.

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Monday inked the mega over Rs 26,000 crore contract with Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ) for the procurement of 240 aero-engines to power the Sukhoi-30MKI jets, which will sustain the operational capability of the 259 such Russian-origin fighters in the IAF combat fleet.The 240 AL-31FP aero-engines will be manufactured by the Koraput division of HAL, with the defence PSU sourcing some components from Russia .Under the contract, signed in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari and defence secretary Giridhar Aramane , HAL ""would enhance the indigenisation content of the aero-engines to 63% by the end of the delivery timeframe to achieve an average of over 54%"", a MoD official said.""This would also help increase the indigenous content of repair and overhaul tasks of the aero-engines. Around 30 aero-engines will be supplied per annum, with the delivery of all 240 to be completed over the next eight years,"" he added. The PM-led cabinet committee on security had cleared the deal on Sept 2, which is crucial considering that the IAF is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle the twin threat from China and Pakistan , as was earlier reported by TOI.The 259 twin-engine Sukhois, the bulk of them produced by HAL under licence from Russia for over $12 billion, are the backbone of the IAF's combat fleet. Another 12 new Sukhois along with associated equipment are now being ordered for around Rs 11,500 crore to replace the ones that crashed over the years.The CCS in Feb has also cleared new engines for the around 60 MiG-29 fighters in the IAF fleet for Rs 5,300 crore, which too will be manufactured by HAL with Russian collaboration. India's failure to indigenously produce aero-engines for fighters, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, has been a major problem over the years. The IAF is now ordering aero-engines in bulk, instead of the earlier piecemeal orders, to bring down the costs and enhance the indigenous content. Engines need to be replaced at least two to three times during a fighter's operational life.","The 240 AL-31FP aero-engines will be manufactured by the Koraput division of HAL, with the defence PSU sourcing some components from Russia.

Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce at Wedding in NYC

Fast forward to September 2023



OMG! Motorcade escorts Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce back to her New York apartment

October was a busy month for the lovebirds



As the year rolled into December



February 2024 brought us the ultimate Swiftie dream



Get All the Details on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's ROMANTIC Weekend in NYC | E! News

Imagine being a Swiftie , living your best *Eras* Tour life, and suddenly, your fave drops a bombshell. Not an album (though we’d love that too), but a *new romance*! Enter Travis Kelce , Kansas City Chiefs tight end, who swooped in like a *Fearless* hero, winning hearts — most notably, Taylor Swift ’s. From Chiefs games to cozy NYC dinners, this love story is as surprising as finding *All Too Well* on repeat during a road trip.Kelce, like many of us, attended a Swift concert, mesmerized by her performance.Not only did he fangirl like a true Swiftie, but he also tried to slide her a friendship bracelet (a Swiftie tradition!) with his number. Bold move, right? Unfortunately, Taylor doesn’t do meet-and-greets during her *Eras* performances, leaving Kelce feeling a bit ""butthurt"" (his words, not ours). However, the story doesn’t end there, and like a plot twist in a Taylor song, things soon turned around for him.When Taylor made her grand NFL debut by attending a Chiefs vs. Bears game. With a Chiefs jacket draped over her shoulders and a scream of “Let’s f–king go,” Swift showed the same enthusiasm we do when she plays *Style* live. She wasn't just cheering for the team, though; it was Travis who had her full attention, and their post-game bar visit confirmed what we all suspected: love was in the air.In classic Swiftie fashion, fans began connecting the dots. By October, Taylor and Travis were spotted together more frequently, and whispers of “they’re really happy” swirled through both NFL and Swiftie circles. While it wasn’t quite a *Love Story* balcony moment, sources hinted they were on the fast track to becoming the next iconic duo — move over, Blake and Ryan!Not only did Swift continue to be the MVP of the Chiefs’ games (did we mention she hugged Donna Kelce, Travis’ mom?), but the football star himself made a surprise appearance on *Saturday Night Live*, poking fun at Taylor’s exes. The audience ate it up, much like we devour every track on *1989*. And just when you thought things couldn’t get cuter, Travis was seen leaving Swift’s NYC apartment with a hint of red lipstick on his lips. A little homage to her *Red* era, perhaps?By November, Taylor took a page out of her songbook and gave a shoutout to Travis during her *Karma* performance in Argentina, singing, ""Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me."" Let’s be real, we all lost our collective minds. The lyrics update not only sealed the deal on this couple’s status but also had fans buzzing for days. When Travis was seen blushing in the crowd, it became clear: this was Swiftie-endorsed.Swift didn’t shy away from publicly supporting her man. She was spotted at multiple Chiefs games, Christmas celebrations, and even the AFC Championship. Their chemistry was undeniable, and even her parents, Scott and Andrea, were present to watch the sparks fly.Taylor at the Super Bowl. Imagine travelling from a concert in Japan to watch your man win football's biggest game. Like, what can't this woman do? After a Chiefs victory, she celebrated with Travis on the field, a moment that will go down in history alongside other iconic Swift moments — hello, *1989* re-release!And just like Taylor does with her albums, the relationship had some bonus tracks. In April 2024, Taylor dropped her 11th studio album, *The Tortured Poets Department*, filled with nods to Travis. Lyrics like “Ditch the clowns, get the crown” were clear love letters to her football beau, making us feel like we were part of their journey, cheering from the sidelines (or the front row of the *Eras* Tour).By summer, Travis was spotted busting moves at Swift’s London shows, even making his Instagram debut in a selfie with British royalty (because, of course, Swift is basically musical royalty). Their love continued to blossom, with hand-holding in Amsterdam and Germany before Travis headed back to training camp.As the NFL season kicked off in September, Taylor was once again by his side, cheering from the suite alongside his family. And, naturally, their date nights remained effortlessly glamorous, from US Open finals to private weekend getaways.So, if you’ve ever wondered what happens when a pop superstar and an NFL icon collide, it’s a love story that even *Speak Now* couldn’t predict. This pairing might just go down as iconic as her *Reputation* tour or his Super Bowl victories. One thing’s for sure: they’ve both found their *Kingdom Come*, and we’re all here for it, popcorn in hand.","Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been dating since September.

Afghanistan vs New Zealand: Why is Greater Noida stadium hosting a Test match?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/afghanistan-vs-new-zealand-why-is-greater-noida-stadium-hosting-a-test-match/articleshow/113243538.cms,"Pink ball moment

TimesView It's extremely distressing that no cricket could be played on two consecutive days, despite the absence of daytime rain on both days. This betrays a lack of foresight and absence of planning in hosting a Test match on a ground with such poor drainage facility, that too in the peak of monsoon. Authorities must take responsibility for this fiasco - as well as for the other shortcomings of the stadium - and carry out the upgrades. Test teams as well as every cricket lover deserve better.

Ad hoc staff for major events

High ambitions

Greater Noida and cricket aren't exactly synonymous, neither is its stadium counted among top venues for matches for top tier domestic fixtures like Ranji Trophy , let alone international cricket.But having found itself as host for a one-off Test between Afghanistan , which is the 'home' team here, and New Zealand , its unsuitability as a venue for serious cricket is in national spotlight.Part of the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex, the stadium is maintained by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA). It doesn't come under the aegis of Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) and doesn't have a super sopper to quickly dry a wet outfield, enough ground covers to protect it or adequately trained ground staff who can manage a problem like inclement weather.The condition of the outfield, because of rain, meant no play was possible on the first two days of the Test match. With all eyes currently are on match referee Javagal Srinath 's report on the preparedness of the stadium, questions are being asked why a ground that has hosted no serious cricket since 2020 was thought to be a venue that could host an international Test match.With a seating capacity of 8,000, the stadium was built by GNIDA for Rs 150 crore in 2013 to host cricket and football matches. Basketball, volleyball courts and a skating rink were introduced in 2014, while an indoor hall was added in 2017.In 2015, the sports complex got approval to host domestic matches and fixtures involving associate countries. The stadium shot into limelight when BCCI hosted theDuleep Trophy in Aug-Sept 2016 here, the first instance in India when first-class matches were played with pink balls and under lights.Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA), however, has been reluctant to host domestic matches at the venue. The last BCCI match that was played at the venue was an U-19 Cooch Behar Trophy contest between Delhi and Haryana in 2019. That was because the Delhi and District Cricket Association didn't have any ground available to host the game.In NCR, UPCA prefers to host domestic matches at Mohan Meakins Ground and Nehru Stadium in Ghaziabad.But it's not like the Greater Noida ground hasn't seen any international cricket. Having been the 'home' ground of the Afghan cricket team, it hosted three T20 matches between Afghanistan and Ireland in March 2020 just before the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed.The stadium recently hosted a few veterans' matches. Other than that, just corporate matches are played there.A management committee, under the GNIDA CEO, manages its affairs. Twenty support staff, hired through an external agency, assist in organising matches. During major events, like the Duleep Trophy, additional manpower is brought in and trained to manage various responsibilities, such as pitch coverage and crowd management.Sources said drainage conditions of the ground are on a par with other international venues, sources said. But the stadium has had its problems with rain. During the Duleep Trophy, a match was affected by heavy rain, but could be completed the next day. BCCI's proficiency meant the ground was properly covered and had equipment to dry it up faster.Sources told TOI the stadium has not been maintained properly in the last few years. Just before the Afghanistan-New Zealand Test was announced, GNIDA invested around Rs 60 lakh to prepare the ground. But heavy rain the preceding evening spoilt the outfield, and it has still not recovered. On Tuesday, GNIDA's additional CEOs Prerna Singh and Ashutosh Dwivedi supervised efforts to bail out water.GNIDA has decided to develop Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex, which spans 38 acres, into a centre of sports excellence. In Oct last year, it invited private sports companies to take over the complex's operations and transform it into a hub for nurturing budding talent. However, the initial effort did not receive the desired response.The sports complex offers state-of-the-art facilities for lawn tennis, table tennis, basketball, badminton, skating, football, cricket, and swimming. It also features a club with amenities such as a food court, open amphitheatre, and conference room.GNIDA, sources said, is renewing efforts to enlist private sector partners for the complex's operation, maintenance and management. The selected operator will have the flexibility to establish sports academies and manage additional revenue-generating activities, aiming to make the complex a thriving sports hub once again.","Greater Noida's Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex was built for Rs 150 crore in 2013.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

How to watch the Lunar Eclipse 2024

The 2024 Lunar Eclipse, or Chandra Grahan , is an eagerly awaited celestial event. Scheduled for September 18, 2024, this second lunar eclipse of the year promises to captivate skywatchers globally. However, the event won’t be visible in India, as the Moon will remain below the horizon throughout the eclipse.A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth aligns between the Moon and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Moon.This shadow can darken the Moon and occasionally give it a reddish hue. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are visible from many regions around the world, contingent on clear skies and the timing of the event.The second lunar eclipse of 2024 will take place on September 18. While this event will be a visual treat for many, it will not be observable from India due to the Moon’s position below the horizon during the eclipse.No, the eclipse will not be visible in India. The other places where observers can witness the eclipse will be in Europe, Africa, North and South America, and parts of Asia will have the chance to witness it. Clear skies will provide the best viewing conditions.Even though the eclipse won’t be visible in India, here are the local timings for the various phases according to Indian Standard Time (IST):Despite these timings, the Moon will be below the horizon in India, making it impossible to observe the eclipse.In India, the Chandra Grahan holds religious significance, even if not visible. The sutak kaal, a period deemed inauspicious, begins several hours before the eclipse starts. For the September eclipse, this period will commence on the night of September 17. During this time, many people follow specific religious practices, including advising pregnant women to remain indoors and avoid certain activities.While the eclipse won’t be visible from India, viewers in other parts of the world can enjoy the spectacle. For those unable to witness it firsthand, many observatories and space agencies will offer live streams of the event online.The September 18, 2024, lunar eclipse is a much-anticipated event globally, even if it’s not visible in India. Check out live streams to experience the Chandra Grahan from wherever you are.","The 2024 Lunar Eclipse, or Chandra Grahan, will take place on September 18, 2024.

OSIRIS-APEX: Nasa's spacecraft to study the asteroid

A cosmic relic

What's in a name?

The asteroid 99942 Apophis , dubbed the "" God of Chaos "" for its menacing potential, is making headlines once more. As Earth prepares for an unprecedented celestial rendezvous in 2029, Nasa 's latest revelations promise to keep our eyes on the skies.Discovered in 2004 by astronomers at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Apophis quickly rose to notoriety.With a diameter of approximately 1,100 feet (335 meters), it was initially deemed one of the most dangerous near-Earth objects. The asteroid was predicted to come perilously close to Earth in 2029, sparking fears of a potential collision. This forecast, however, has been revised as astronomers tracked Apophis with increasing precision.The breakthrough came in March 2021. Using the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex and the Green Bank Telescope, scientists gathered high-resolution radar data that allowed them to accurately map Apophis's orbit.Apophis, classified as an S-type asteroid, is composed of silicate materials mixed with nickel and iron. Its shape, resembling a ""peanut,"" adds to the intrigue. Scientists are keen to understand its rotation and structural dynamics, including its potential for ""asteroid quakes"" due to gravitational interactions.On April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass within 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) of Earth's surface—closer than the geostationary satellites that orbit the planet. This close approach will offer a rare, unfiltered view of the asteroid for those in the Eastern Hemisphere. ""Although Apophis made a recent close approach with Earth, it was still nearly 10.6 million miles away,"" explained JPL scientist Marina Brozovic. ""We were able to acquire incredibly precise information about its distance, setting up a wonderful science opportunity.""The recent surge in attention is largely due to reports of Nasa broadcasting a live feed of Apophis , offering a rare glimpse at an asteroid of this magnitude as it hurls through space. However, this claim is incorrect.Although NASA and other astronomers are actively monitoring Apophis due to its close approach to Earth in 2029, there is no continuous live feed dedicated to tracking the asteroid.The potential changes in its trajectory can be tracked on Nasa's official website Experts, however, are reassuring the public that despite the asteroid's nickname, the chances of a collision remain incredibly slim — at least this time around.“Apophis is not on a direct collision course with Earth in 2029,” said Dr Sarah Thompson, a leading astrophysicist at Nasa, according to media reports. “But we’re watching closely, as space objects can have unpredictable behavior over time.”“It’s a one-in-a-million shot, but it’s there,” Dr Thompson added. “We’re using every resource we have to calculate its movements and ensure we’re not taken by surprise.”However, Davide Farnocchia of Nasa’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said the extensive analysis confirmed that the asteroid poses no threat for at least the next century. ""A 2068 impact is not in the realm of possibility anymore,"" said Farnocchia.As per media reports, if Apophis were to ever strike Earth, the results would be catastrophic. An impact from an asteroid of this size would release energy equivalent to over 1,200 megatons of TNT—enough to flatten entire cities. The event would have both local and global effects, from tsunamis to severe atmospheric disruptions.In anticipation of this close encounter, Nasa has repurposed its OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, now dubbed OSIRIS-APEX, for a detailed study of Apophis. After successfully completing its mission to collect samples from asteroid Bennu in 2023, OSIRIS-APEX will fly by Apophis on April 23, 2029, and then conduct an 18-month investigation. The spacecraft will map Apophis’s surface, analyze its composition, and observe any changes triggered by the flyby.Formed over 4.6 billion years ago, Apophis is a remnant from the early solar system. Its journey from the main asteroid belt to its current near-Earth orbit was shaped by planetary forces, particularly Jupiter's gravity.Named after the ancient Egyptian demon of chaos, Apophis continues to captivate scientists and the public alike. As we prepare for the asteroid’s close approach, it reminds us of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of our solar system.","Asteroid 99942 Apophis, dubbed the "" God of Chaos "" for its menacing potential, is making headlines once more.

PM Modi hasn't handled China well: Rahul Gandhi in Washington,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pm-modi-hasnt-handled-china-well-claims-chinese-troops-occupying-delhi-sized-territory-in-ladakh-rahul-gandhi-in-washington/articleshow/113243682.cms,"LIVE: Shri Rahul Gandhi interacts with the media at the National Press Club, Washington DC, USA.

NEW DELHI: Leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government over the ongoing border standoff with China, stating that the situation has been mishandled. Speaking at the National Press Club Washington on Wednesday, during his visit to the United States, Gandhi remarked, ""We've got Chinese troops occupying land the size of Delhi in Ladakh, and I think that's a disaster.""Rahul expressed concerns about the presence of Chinese troops in Indian territory and questioned how any government could consider that situation to be well-managed.""We've got Chinese troops occupying land the size of Delhi in Ladakh, and I think that's a disaster. The media doesn't like to write about it. How would America react if a neighbour occupied 4,000 square kilometers of its territory? Would any president be able to get away with saying he's handled that well? So, I don't think Mr Modi has handled China well at all. I see no reason why Chinese troops should be sitting in our territory,"" he said.The border standoff between India and China has been ongoing since May 2020 when Chinese troops attempted to alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. The conflict escalated with a violent clash between the two sides in the Galwan Valley. Since then, Indian forces have been stationed in forward positions, with more than 50,000 soldiers deployed along the LAC to prevent further Chinese incursions.Gandhi also addressed broader issues of economic development and emphasized the need for a decentralized, democratic vision of production in contrast to China's centralised manufacturing model. He criticised India's current over-reliance on a services-based economy, arguing that the country cannot generate enough employment without a strong manufacturing base.""We don't want to do it like the Chinese are doing it. We don't want to do it in an environment which is non-democratic, which is not liberal. So the real question for the 21st century, the Chinese have placed a production vision on the table. It's a non-democratic production vision. Can the United States and India answer that by placing a vision for production in a democratic free society? And I think that's where a lot of answers lie,"" he said.""For a country like India to simply say that we're going to ignore manufacturing and only run a services-based economy means you cannot give employment to people,"" Gandhi stated. He called for a vision that embraces production in a democratic and liberal society, highlighting that both India and the United States have an opportunity to reclaim their roles as global producers.Gandhi advocated for supporting small and medium-sized businesses and reviving traditional industries across India. ""Each area in India has its own specialty of production. For example, Ballari in Karnataka has a deep textile industry that has been destroyed. We are looking at these pockets of excellence and trying to bring modern technology and financial support to build them,"" he explained.He said that not manufacturing enough means, not enough employment can be generated. Rahul further added that there is a huge opportunity for both India and the US to regain the ability to produce.""Here in the United States that the West, America, Europe, and India, the West used to be the producer of the world. If you wanted to buy a car, in the 60s, you bought an American car, washing machine, refrigerator...You guys were at the forefront of that. And then somewhere along the line, America decided, India decided, and the West decided that we're just going to stop. And we handed the whole thing to the Chinese. Now for a country like India, to simply say that we're going to ignore manufacturing, and only run a services-based economy, it means you cannot give employment to people,"" said Rahul Gandhi.""I am more interested in the act of production- also called manufacturing. Look at what most American, Indian and European countries do. They organize consumption. Uber organizes consumption. Organizing consumption is easy. Organizing production is a completely different ballgame, much more complicated. You have to deal with things when you organize production that you simply don't have to deal with when you organize production. So to me, there's a huge opportunity for India and the United States to regain that ability to produce,"" he further added.In contrast to China’s model of large, centralized factories, Gandhi proposed a more decentralised production system, where small and medium businesses are empowered with modern technology. His party is already testing some of these ideas in the Congress-governed states of Karnataka and Telangana, focusing on revitalizing traditional industries like textiles.Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of the Modi government extended to domestic economic policies as well, particularly the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few large business conglomerates. He pointed out that the current economic model was monopolizing Indian industries and harming the country’s productivity.During his interaction, Gandhi also addressed his role as the Leader of the Opposition and the ideological battle between the INDIA alliance and the BJP-RSS. He vowed to defend India's institutions and protect the rights of marginalized communities, including lower castes, tribals, and minorities.Rahul’s US visit included interactions with the Indian diaspora, students, faculty, and US lawmakers, marking his first trip to the US since becoming the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.","Rahul Gandhi criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government over the ongoing border standoff with China.
