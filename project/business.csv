India shifted from judicial interference to supporting arbitration: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-shifted-from-judicial-interference-to-supporting-arbitration-cji/articleshow/110810860.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud on Friday said India is walking shoulder to shoulder with leading centres for global commercial arbitration by replacing a regime of judicial interference with arbitration with one that supports arbitration, recognizes party autonomy and structures the role of courts in facilitating arbitration.Speaking at the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom with the honour of sitting on the chair of the president of UK SC, Justice Chandrachud said though India has created international arbitral centres of excellence, “we have to ensure that these new institutions are not controlled by a self-perpetuating clique.”“These institutions must be based on the foundation of robust professionalism and the ability to generate consistent arbitral processes. Transparency and accountability, values by which the work of conventional courts is assessed and critiqued, cannot be alien to the world of arbitration,” he said.Hoping that Indian arbitration institutions attain the trust and professionalism of their global counterpart, the CJI said as more and more commercial disputes move from courts to arbitral tribunals, “the substitution of courts should not result in creation of opaque structures.”Justice Chandrachud said commercial arbitration has remained relevant for the last five centuries, more so today as “the courts in India are overburdened despite the high courts disposing of 2.15 million cases and the district courts disposing 44.7 million cases in 2023.”Addressing the judges of the UK SC, the CJI said for Indian judiciary no case is big or small and every litigant has the right to just remedy. “The width of our jurisdiction was designed to ensure widest access to justice. But surely, every case need not find a remedy before the court, with emerging forms ofdispute resolution such as arbitration and mediation gaining acceptance,” he said.The CJI expressed concern that though arbitration as a mode of commercial dispute resolution is gaining ground in India, many petitions are being filed in the Supreme Court challenging high court orders on petitions challenging the awards of the arbitral tribunals.“The ostensible reason is the order (of the HC) but a scratch at the surface reveals that the real reason is a perceived lack of confidence in the arbitrator… Although arbitrators are private actors, they perform adjudicatory functions which require impartial decision-making… An independent arbitrator is impartial, and an impartial arbitrator is independent,” he said.","Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said India is walking shoulder to shoulder with leading centres for global commercial arbitration.

Take precautions in monsoon to prevent Ghatkopar type hoarding crash: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/take-precautions-in-monsoon-to-prevent-ghatkopar-type-hoarding-crash-sc/articleshow/110810852.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Railways to take adequate precautionary measures ahead of the monsoon to avoid incidents like the May 13 crash of an oversized hoarding at Ghatkopar that killed 14 persons and caused property damage.On an application filed by MCGM in a pending petition challenging the Bombay HC’s 2017 judgment ousting the civic body’s jurisdiction over hoardings on railway land, a vacation bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and P. B. Varale said the rains during the monsoon are accompanied by gusty winds and all authorities, including Railways and MCGM, should take extra care and measures to avoid such incidents. The bench posted the matter for hearing next week.MCGM said its policy permitted the erection of hoardings with a maximum size of 40 ft X 40 ft. The hoarding at Ghatkopar was 120 ft X 120 ft, which could not withstand the wind speed during a thunderstorm and collapsed on an adjacent petrol pump.Listing out 45 oversized billboards on land owned by southern and central railways, including three the size of the crashed Ghatkopar hoarding, the MCGM said, “Given the onset of monsoon and the grave hazard posed by such billboards to the general public, there exists an urgent and crucial need to regulate the sizes of hoardings immediately.”The 45 oversized hoardings, not conforming to the maximum permissible size of 40 ft X 40 ft stipulated by the civic body, “suffer from a high likelihood of collapse on the adjoining municipal roads/private lands/structures, etc. The said structures endanger the lives and properties of the public,” MCGM said in its application.The District Disaster Management Authority had, after the Ghatkopar crash, written to the railways for a structural audit of the oversized hoardings and their immediate removal. The railways responded by stating that MCGM has no jurisdiction over the hoardings on railway land.Appearing for the railways, additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee told the bench that the Ghatkopar hoarding crashed because the structure was unable to bear the load of the billboard. He said that billboards erected on railway properties are permitted only after considering the structural stability, the soil condition, and the probable wind speed during different seasons.MCGM said even the Ghatkopar hoarding had a structural stability certificate but collapsed because of its huge size. “Only obtaining a structural stability audit/certificate does not absolve the railways from their statutory duty to comply with the provisions of the Disaster Management Act,” it said and requested the bench for an urgent hearing on the application prior to the onset of the monsoon.","The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Railways to take adequate precautionary measures ahead of the monsoon.

67 students scoring a perfect 720 in NEET-UG 2024 raises doubts; six have seat numbers from same sequence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/67-students-scoring-a-perfect-720-in-neet-ug-2024-raises-doubts-six-have-seat-numbers-from-same-sequence/articleshow/110752235.cms,"MUMBAI: The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on Tuesday, have taken several students by surprise. A day after, students and parents have raised objections over an unprecedented numbers of students, 67, bagging the perfect score - 720 out of 720 - also other discrepancies in the statement issued by the agency.Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from a same centre.Parents, in letters to the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results before the counselling commences.Scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which parents claim is impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking.The NTA, in a statement, said that they received few representations and court cases from NEET candidates raising concerns of loss of time during the exam held on May 5.""Such cases/representations were considered by NTA and the normalisation formula, which has been devised and adopted by the apex court in a judgement from 2018, to address the loss of time faced by candidates. The loss of time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So their marks can be 718 or 719 too,"" said the statement.Parent representative Ruiee Kapoor said that the explanation provided by the NTA is not satisfactory as a score of 718 or 719 is technically improbable. ""Also 67 students scoring full marks is unprecedented in NEET-UG and highly unusual. There is also bunching of students with higher marks, which has led to a major discrepancy in the marks and their corresponding marks. At the same scores, the corresponding ranks have gone up by three to four times. While the overall cut-off has also risen from 137 to 164, students even with 720 marks will find it difficult to get a seat in AIIMS Delhi-a sought-after institute,"" said Kapoor, adding that MBBS admissions closed at rank 57 in the open merit last year in the institute.An NTA official said that more students scored higher marks due to the normalisation process and also because the physics and chemistry sections were relatively easier and as per NCERT books. This was done to address equity and also to discourage coaching mafia, said the official.Another parent claimed that the provision of grace marks due to waste of time should have been specified in the information brochure, as students could have utilised it in the past. Sachin Bangad, a parent representative, said, the exam was ""managed"".""How is that six students who scored full 720 marks are from the same exam centre in Faridabad, Haryana,"" he asked. A senior NTA official reasoned this to the fact that in this particular exam centre in Haryana, ""there was incorrect distribution of papers and they lost 45 minutes. When it was corrected, a formula as per previous court order was used in a few cities including this.""Experts including faculty doctors have demanded an explanation of the normalization criteria of NEET results at how many centers was the normalization applied. Parents said the significantly high cut-off have put off many candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges.""Students scoring less than 660 marks now have a very poor chance of securing admission to government medical colleges,"" said Bangad. This is in contrast to the previous year, where students with 600 marks were able to secure seats in government colleges.","Parents are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results.

It is not a normal thing that NDA got such a big victory under the leadership of the PM for the third time in a row.” Stating that people had full faith in Modi, he said, “Because of you, today we can proudly say in front of the world that India has become the fifth-largest economy of the world.”Chirag said the PM had the willpower to reduce the difference between villages and cities, rich and poor, and to set the target of a developed India by 2047.HAM (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi, while announcing his support to Modi, said the commitment was from the family and lineage of Dasrath Manjhi who cut a road through a mountain with “chisel and hammer” in 24 years, signalling his party’s determination to remain in the NDA.

Capital-in-waiting? Land prices soar in Amaravati,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/capital-in-waiting-land-prices-soar-in-amaravati/articleshow/110806991.cms,"Farmers expect further increase in land price if PM makes positive statement

VIJAYWADA: Real estate prices zoomed in Amaravati witnessing anywhere between 50% and 100% increase in just three days after the election results are out. The massive victory of the TDP , Jana Sena and BJP alliance has cleared the uncertainties over the capital, renewing the buyers' interest.However, minimal transactions are taking place as there are hardly any sellers in the capital region now. Everyone is expecting a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in favour of Amaravati during N Chandrababu Naidu's swearing-in ceremony as CM to be held on June 12 near the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the capital region.Farmers are expecting a further increase of land prices in case of a positive statement by Modi.Land prices came down anywhere between 60% and 75% after outgoing chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy announced his plans of three capitals in 2019. All euphoria created around the proposed futuristic capital city vanished. After five years, with govt change, the realty sector in Amaravati is witnessing a 'V' shaped recovery in terms of prices.Ginjupalli Subbarao, a farmer from Amaravati, said that he is getting many calls from prospective buyers. ""There were no takers till six months ago but the sentiment has slowly started to change with people sensing change,"" he said. ""With the election results in favour of the alliance, land prices have come back to 2018 levels.""During the election campaign, Naidu had said that Amaravati would be revived soon after coming to power.Speaking to TOI, TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh gave more clarity saying his party did not have any plans to change the master plan for Amaravati prepared before they lost power in 2018. He said there was no better alternative to the existing masterplan, and they would stick to the original strategy of developing the city on a self-sustaining model.Despite spending about Rs 10,000 crore, the then TDP govt could not complete all trunk infrastructure works which included laying roads and drains along with giving power and water supply. Sources said Naidu is now planning to complete the trunk infrastructure works which will give enough thrust for private investors and developers to start their businesses.Several central government institutions like Reserve Bank of India, Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), CPWD, Public Sector Undertakings like NTPC, ONGC, Indian Bank, State Bank of India and others have purchased lands to set up their regional offices in Amaravati. Sources said that Naidu is looking to bring all these institutions to Amaravati as soon as possible so that the economic activity will start rolling.Naturally, the demand for lands near these institutions is pushing the prices in these areas further up. Lands around private universities which have already opened campuses are also in high demand. While the farmers, who put up a valiant fight against YSRC govt, are happy with the renewed buyer interest, the investors are chasing the prices with FOMO (fear of missing out), said Gopal Yadav, a realtor from Amaravati.","Land prices came down anywhere between 60% and 75% after outgoing chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy announced his plans of three capitals in 2019.

The breakthroughs for Nadhamuni (219m) and Kirawali (320m) tunnels were also achieved. MRVC has completed 50% of the Rs 2,782-crore project, with the goal of opening it by Dec 2025.”The Wavarle tunnel was constructed using the new Austrian tunnelling method, a process involving cyclic excavation followed by primary support and delayed secondary lining. The tunnel features a ballastless track, public refuge areas, a tunnel control system, lighting, firefighting, and ventilation systems meeting international standards. It is 7.32m tall and 13.28m wide.The excavation faced significant challenges, including fractured rock masses with water seepage and minimal cover as low as 12m. Two water streams cross the tunnel alignment at the low cover zone. Despite these difficulties, an average excavation output of 175m per month was achieved through careful planning and daytime blasting. Night blasting is not permitted.The new double-line corridor will enhance connectivity by allowing local trains to run between Mumbai and Karjat via Panvel, complementing the existing line used for goods trains and a few long-distance passenger services. It will connect Navi Mumbai with Raigad district and act as a catalyst for the development of Panvel, Karjat and the proposed Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area.The project involves acquisition of over 57 hectares of private land and 4.4 hectares of govt land.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Watch: Sunita Williams dances upon reaching International Space Station after Starliner mission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-sunita-williams-dances-upon-reaching-international-space-station-after-starliner-mission/articleshow/110781478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Boeing Starliner , piloted by Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore, successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday. This mission marks a historic milestone as Williams becomes the first woman to pilot and test a new crewed spacecraft on its maiden voyage.Upon arrival, Williams celebrated her third trip to the ISS with a joyful dance, a gesture of her excitement and happiness. She was warmly welcomed by the seven astronauts aboard the station, who greeted her and Wilmore with the traditional ringing of a bell. Describing the crew as ""another family,"" Williams expressed her gratitude for the warm reception.After launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the spacecraft docked with the ISS 26 hours later, despite a one-hour delay due to minor technical issues such as helium leaks. The mission's primary objective was to validate the Boeing Starliner as a viable alternative to the SpaceX Crew Module for ferrying astronauts under NASA's commercial crew program.The astronauts monitored the Starliner as it autonomously navigated a series of maneuvers to dock with the ISS. They also completed crucial tests, including manually flying the spacecraft for the first time in space. During their week-long stay, Williams and Wilmore will assist with tests and conduct scientific experiments.Reflecting on the mission, Williams said, ""It feels like going back home."" She is known for previously carrying an idol of Lord Ganesh and the Bhagavad Gita to space. Before liftoff, Williams, who helped design the Starliner, admitted to some pre-launch nerves but expressed excitement about the spacecraft she had named ""Calypso"" after the ship of the famed French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.The astronauts' return journey will conclude with a landing on solid ground, unlike previous missions that ended with ocean landings.","The Boeing Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday.

"Rio Grande: After 34 million years, scientists discover Antarctica's lost river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rio-grande-after-34-million-years-scientists-discover-antarcticas-lost-river/articleshow/110775221.cms,"A recently discovered ancient river in Antarctica , referred to as the Rio Grande , is providing new insights into the continent's climatic history. This groundbreaking find is crucial for understanding how climate change has shaped the landscape over millions of years.The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona , led by geoscientist Dr Stewart Jamieson. ""The Rio Grande is unlike anything we have seen in Antarctica,"" Dr Jamieson said. ""This river system was buried under ice for millions of years and offers a unique window into the past.""The Rio Grande, which rivals some of the world's largest rivers, was identified through satellite imagery and radar data. The river's channels stretch over 680 miles, and it likely played a significant role in transporting water and sediment across the continent during a warmer period in Earth's history, a Newsweek report.The presence of the Rio Grande suggests that Antarctica once had a much milder climate, with conditions that could support flowing water. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the continent's glacial history and indicates that parts of Antarctica may have been ice-free during certain periods.""The implications of this discovery are profound,"" said Dr Jamieson. ""It changes our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet and its stability. Knowing that such a large river system existed implies that the ice sheet was much smaller than we thought.""The research team plans to conduct further studies to determine the age of the river system and the climatic conditions that allowed it to form. These investigations could provide valuable data for predicting future changes in the Antarctic ice sheet in response toglobal warming .The discovery of the Rio Grande also raises questions about the potential for similar hidden river systems in other parts of Antarctica. ""We are just scratching the surface,"" Dr Jamieson noted. ""There could be other river systems buried beneath the ice, waiting to be discovered.""As climate change continues to impact the polar regions, understanding the history of Antarctica's ice and water systems becomes increasingly important. The findings from the Rio Grande will help scientists develop more accurate models of ice sheet dynamics and sea-level rise.This discovery highlights the importance of continued exploration and research in Antarctica.

WHO confirms first fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-confirms-first-fatal-human-case-of-h5n2-bird-flu/articleshow/110751897.cms,"A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant , the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday. The patient passed away on April 24 after experiencing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea. Despite having no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, the individual had multiple underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, according to a statement from Mexico's health ministry.The WHO reported that the patient, who had been bedridden for three weeks prior to developing acute symptoms, was hospitalized in Mexico City and succumbed to the illness the same day. This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus globally and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico.""Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,"" the WHO said. Mexican health authorities conducted laboratory tests and reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23.In March, H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico. However, establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections has been challenging. The WHO estimates the risk to the general population as ""low.""The Mexican health ministry emphasized that there is no risk of contagion for the population, noting that all samples from identified contacts of the patient have tested negative. Authorities are closely monitoring farms near the victim's home and have set up a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area.Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the complexity of the situation, saying, ""How this individual got infected is a big question mark that at least this initial report doesn't really address thoroughly.""The WHO and Mexican health officials continue to investigate the source of the infection. Bird flu has been known to infect various mammals, including seals, raccoons, bears, and cattle, primarily due to contact with infected birds. Scientists remain vigilant for changes in the virus that could signal its adaptation to spread more easily among humans.In the United States, a different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading among dairy cow herds, with a small number of human cases reported. However, none of these cases involved human-to-human transmission.Australia also reported its first human case of A(H5N1) infection in May, with no signs of transmission, while noting more poultry cases of H7 bird flu on farms in Victoria state.Pekosz added, ""Since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections, because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans.""(With inputs from agencies)","A 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico has died from bird flu in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant.

The jury trial would have been the first-ever in a civil antitrust case lodged by the justice department, Google said.Friday's ruling by US district judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia means Google will face a non-jury trial in the lawsuit, which seeks primarily to break up its digital advertising business to allow for more competition.Google confirmed that Brinkema, who had previously scheduled a jury trial for September, had issued the ruling during a court hearing but declined to comment further on Friday.The company has denied wrongdoing and said it was not admitting liability by submitting a damages' payment.

"US employers added a robust 272,000 jobs in May in a sign of sustained economic health",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-employers-added-a-robust-272000-jobs-in-may-in-a-sign-of-sustained-economic-health/articleshow/110802381.cms,"WASHINGTON: America's employers added a strong 272,000 jobs in May, accelerating from April and a sign that companies are still confident enough in the economy to keep hiring despite persistently high interest rates .Last month's sizable job gain suggests that the economy is still growing steadily, propelled by consumer spending on travel, entertainment and other services. US airports, for example, reported record traffic over the Memorial Day weekend. A healthy job market typically drives consumer spending, the economy's principal fuel. Though some recent signs had raised concerns about economic weakness, May's jobs report should help assuage those fears.Still, Friday's report from the government included some signs of a potential slowdown. The unemployment rate , for example, edged up for a second straight month, to a still-low 4%, from 3.9%, ending a 27-month streak of unemployment below 4%. That streak had matched the longest such run since the late 1960s.President Joe Biden is still likely to point to Friday's jobs report as a sign of the economy's robust health under his administration. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump has focused his criticism of Biden's economic policies on the surge in inflation , which polls show still weighs heavily in voters' assessment of the economy.Hourly paychecks accelerated last month, a welcome gain for workers though one that could contribute to stickier inflation. Hourly wages rose 4.1% from a year ago, faster than the rate of inflation and more quickly than in April. Some companies may raise their prices to offset their higher wage costs.The Federal Reserve's inflation fighters would like to see the economy cool a bit as they consider when to begin cutting their benchmark rate. The Fed sharply raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 after the vigorous recovery from the pandemic recession ignited the worst inflation in 40 years.Friday's report will likely underscore Fed officials' intention to delay any cuts to their benchmark interest rate while they monitor inflation and economic data. Though Chair Jerome Powell has said he expects inflation to continue to ease, he has stressed that the Fed's policymakers need ""greater confidence"" that inflation will fall back to their 2% target before they would reduce borrowing costs. Annual inflation has declined to 2.7% by the Fed's preferred measure, from a peak above 7% in 2022.""This report is going to complicate the Fed's job,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist for ZipRecruiter. ""No one's getting those very clear signals that they were hoping for that a rate cut is appropriate in July or September.""Last month's hiring occurred broadly across most of the economy. But job growth was particularly robust in health care, which added 84,000 jobs, and restaurants, hotels, and entertainment providers, which gained 42,000.Governments, particularly local governments, added 43,000 positions. Professional and business services, which includes managers, architects and information technology, grew by 33,000.One potential sign of weakness in the May employment report was a drop in the proportion of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one; it fell from 62.7% to 62.5%. Most of that drop occurred among people 55 and over, many of whom are baby boomers who are retiring.A surge in immigration in the past three years has boosted the size of the US workforce and has been a key driver of the healthy pace of job growth. (Economists have said it isn't clear whether the government's jobs report is picking up all those gains, particularly among unauthorized immigrants.)When the Fed began aggressively raising rates, most economists had expected the resulting jump in borrowing costs to drive unemployment to painfully high levels and cause a recession. Yet the job market has proved more durable than almost anyone had predicted. Even so, Americans remain generally frustrated by high prices, a continuing source of discontent that could imperil Biden's re-election bid.The economy expanded at just a 1.3% annual rate in the first three months of this year, the government said last week, a sharp pullback from the 3.4% pace in last year's final quarter. Much of the slowdown, though, reflected reduced stockpiling by businesses and other volatile factors, while consumer and business spending made clear that demand remained solid.In April, though, consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, declined. That raised concern among economists that elevated inflation and interest rates are increasingly pressuring some consumers, particularly younger and lower-income households.A key reason why the economy is still producing solid net job growth is that layoffs remain at historic lows. Just 1.5 million people lost jobs in April. That's the lowest monthly figure on record - outside of the peak pandemic period - in data going back 24 years. After struggling to fill jobs for several years, most employers are reluctant to lay off workers.","Friday's report will likely underscore Fed officials' intention to delay any cuts to their benchmark interest rate.

"First Lady Jill Biden attends son Hunter Biden's gun trial, two more witnesses expected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-lady-jill-biden-attends-son-hunter-bidens-gun-trial-two-more-witnesses-expected/articleshow/110800616.cms,"WILMINGTON: First lady Jill Biden has arrived at the courthouse for son Hunter Biden 's federal gun trial . She left France on Thursday evening where she was attending D-Day events with president Joe Biden . She'll return to France for a state dinner.Federal prosecutors are wrapping up their gun case against Hunter Biden, with two more witnesses expected Friday in their effort to prove to jurors that the president's son lied on a mandatory gun purchase form when he said he wasn't ""an unlawful user of, or addicted to"" drugs.Prosecutors were still planning to call a drug expert and an FBI chemist, capping a week that has been largely dedicated to highlighting the seriousness of his drug problem through highly personal and sometimes salacious testimony.Jurors heard from his ex-wife and a former girlfriend who testified about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. They saw images of the president's son bare-chested and disheveled in a filthy room, and half-naked holding crack pipes, and they watched video of his crack cocaine weighed on a scale.Prosecutor say the evidence is necessary to prove that Hunter, 54, was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked ""no"" on the form. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, has argued Hunter did not think of himself as an ""addict"" when he bought the gun and did not intend to deceive anyone.Meanwhile, president Joe Biden worked to walk the line between president and father, telling ABC in an interview that he would accept the jury's verdict and ruling out a pardon for his son. Earlier this week he issued a statement saying: ""I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.""Biden is in France this week for D-Day anniversary events. First lady Jill Biden, who attended court most of the week, flew from France Thursday to be at the trial again Friday before she will return to France for a state dinner.Hunter Biden been charged with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.He has pleaded not guilty. He'd hoped to resolve the gun case and another separate tax case in California with a plea deal last year, the result of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings. The deal had him pleading guilty to lower-level charges that would have resolved both cases and spared him the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. It fell apart after Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement and the lawyers couldn't resolve them.Hunter Biden said he got charged because the Justice Department bowed to pressure from Republicans who argued the Democratic president's son was getting special treatment, and who have escalated their attacks on the criminal justice system since Donald Trump's recent conviction in New York City in a hush money case.Lowell said he would call the president's brother James as a witness, but it's unclear yet whether Hunter Biden will testify.But jurors have already heard his voice. Prosecutors have played lengthy audio excerpts in court of his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" in which he writes about his lifelong addiction issues and spiraling descent after death of his brother Beau in 2015. The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn't mention it specifically.Lowell has said Hunter Biden's state of mind was different when he wrote the book than when he purchased the gun, when he didn't believe he had an addiction. He pointed out to jurors that some of the questions on the firearms transaction record are in the present tense, such as ""are you an unlawful user of or addicted to"" drugs.And he's suggested Hunter Biden might have felt he had a drinking problem at the time, but not a drug problem. Alcohol abuse doesn't preclude a gun purchase.The reason law enforcement raised any questions about the revolver is because Hallie Biden, Beau's widow, found it unloaded in Hunter's truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a nearby market. She testified about the episode Thursday.She told jurors she considered hiding the gun but thought her kids might find it, so she decided to throw it away.""I realize it was a stupid idea now, but I was panicking,"" she said. ""I didn't want him to hurt himself, and I didn't want my kids to find it and hurt themselves.""Hallie Biden, who had a brief romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau died, testified that from the time Hunter returned to Delaware from a 2018 trip to California until she threw his gun away, she did not see him using drugs. That time period included the day he bought the weapon.But much of her testimony focused on Oct. 23, 2018 - 11 days after he bought it. Hunter was staying with her and seemed exhausted. Asked by the prosecutor if it appeared that Hunter was using drugs around then, she said, ""He could have been.""As Hunter slept in her home, Hallie Biden went to check his car. She said she was hoping to help him get or stay sober, free of both alcohol and cocaine. She said she found the remnants of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia . She also found the gun Hunter purchased in a box with a broken lock that kept it from fully closing. There was ammunition too.She put in a leather pouch put the pouch in a bag and tossed it into in the trash can at Janssen's Market. He noticed it missing and asked her whether she had taken it.""Are you insane?"" he texted. He told her to go back to the market to look for it.Surveillance footage played for jurors showed her digging around in the trash can for the gun, but it wasn't there. She asked store officials if someone had taken out the trash. Hallie testified Hunter told her to file a police report because the gun was registered in his name. She called the police while she was still at the store.Officers located the man who inadvertently took the gun along with other recyclables from the trash and retrieved it. The case was eventually closed because of lack of cooperation from Hunter Biden, who was considered the victim.Jurors also heard from the officers who handled the case, from the man who found the gun and from the store clerk who sold Hunter the revolver.If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.He also faces a separate trial in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.","President Joe Biden says he will accept the jury's verdict and ruling out a pardon for his son.

Involuntary manslaughter case dropped against 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania woman's death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/involuntary-manslaughter-case-dropped-against-911-dispatcher-in-pennsylvania-womans-death/articleshow/110797836.cms,"Prosecutors this week dropped an involuntary manslaughter case against a 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania who had been accused of failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman who was found dead a day later of internal bleeding.Greene county district attorney Brianna Vanata said she acted to end the case against Leon ""Lee"" Price after reviewing an investigator 's report that said he felt charges were not justified in the July 2020 death of 54-year-old Diania Kronk .""There was just no criminal culpability here,"" Vanata said in a phone interview Thursday. She said the decision to pursue charges two years after Kronk died and shortly after her family filed a lawsuit over it was a mistake by the then district attorney, Dave Russo.""I'm not sure what the previous district attorney was thinking,"" Vanata said. ""That's where I'm at.""Price's defense lawyer, Timothy Ross, said Thursday the charges had been a stressful ordeal for his client, who he described as an upstanding employee who had consistently maintained he was innocent of the allegations. In the wake of Kronk's death, Ross said, an investigator had told Price he would not be charged.Ross said Price is ""moving forward, rebuilding his reputation in this community and just happy to put these charges behind him.""Investigators had said Price was reluctant to dispatch help without getting more assurances Kronk would actually go to the hospital.Vanata said she based her decision on an August 2020 memo by Greene county regional police chief Zachary Sams that said Price may not have been trained properly and the investigator felt Price's actions did not ""rise to the levels necessary to facilitate a criminal charge.""On a recording, Price was heard questioning Kronk's daughter Kelly Titchenell for about four minutes. As Titchenell described her mother's condition, Price asked if Kronk was ""willing to go"" to the hospital about a half-hour away from her home in Sycamore. Titchenell assured him she would and said she was concerned her mother might die.Titchenell told the dispatcher Kronk had been drinking heavily for some weeks, she had been losing weight and appeared to be turning yellow.Price said he would send an ambulance but then added that ""we really need to make sure she's willing to go."" Price asked Titchenell to call once she got to Kronk's home, but Titchenell said she could not find her mother's landline and there was not cell service.Titchenell said that when she got to Kronk's home, her mother was nude on the porch and talking incoherently, telling her repeatedly she was Ok. Titchenell said an autopsy attributed Kronk's death to internal bleeding.Titchenell did not call 911 again on her way home, believing that her uncle would soon check on her. The uncle discovered the next day that Kronk had died.Russo said there was ample evidence and called Vanata's move to drop the case a political decision. Russo said Thursday the involuntary manslaughter charge had survived previous defense efforts to have it dismissed.At Vanata's request, a judge withdrew the charges on Monday. Jury selection and trial had been scheduled for next week.Vanata said she approached Price about a potential plea bargain to a lesser charge but he did not take the deal. Titchenell questioned the decision to drop charges.""I feel that there was too much for the new district attorney to go through,"" Titchenell said in a phone interview Wednesday. ""She would have had to put in a lot of time and work to understand this case, to go over everything. I feel there was too much for her, so she was trying to basically get away without going to trial.""Vanata said she spent ""many, many hours"" going through the evidence since taking office in January. She beat Russo in the 2023 GOP primary by 44 percentage points. ""It definitely was not an easy decision to come to.""Price is no longer a dispatcher and now works for Greene county in maintenance.""Mr. Price did lose his job and this, I'm sure, has been an ordeal for him,"" Vanata said. ""But also I feel so horrible for the family that had to go through this as well. It dragged them along for four years also.""","District attorney: ""There was just no criminal culpability here"" Leon ""Lee"" Price was accused of failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman.

Amid the ongoing summer season, the people of Karachi suffer from massive load-shedding and severe power cuts , which have been a problem for the general public's survival in the scorching heat.As the heatwave worsens in Karachi, people still have a slim chance and hope of comfort, as some individuals from the business community in the city have come together with initiatives like water camps to help the people.Muhammad Iqbal a daily wage worker working at one such water camp said, ""This has been an initiative of the people to quench the thirst of the people. We are only requesting the government to stop load shedding and organize such camps. So that the people can survive in the heat.""When asked about how the children have been falling ill due to the scorching heat of the summer ""Only the government can do something in this case, we are trying to do our best to help the people. The government must make some committees and do surveys to actually assess the bad situation and then take serious action over the matter, as the condition grows worse by the day"".Nasir Khan a rickshaw puller stated ""Our locality has been suffering a lot, it has been almost 20 days since we have received water supply in our area. Even the electricity is not supplied for more than 16 hours a day, so we have no possibility of relief in that matter also. I believe that the government is not taking the matter so seriously. The government has closed state-run schools, but private school students are still going to school in high temperatures. And these kids are not able to come back home and get relief because there are 16-hour-long powercuts, and this has been the real situation of the people of Karachi.""Muneeb, another citizen of Karachi, stated that ""although the scorching heat is a disaster of nature, the government is also not that helpful. I think this is the worst possible scenario for us, as the electricity department is not having any mercy on the general public. People have been paying bills of thousands and lakhs of rupees but I don't know why, there is still no electricity in our houses. We have been suffering for over 12 hours of load shedding in this high heat, while they sit in the air-conditioned offices.""""They will not be able to tolerate any heat if the roles are reversed. And I believe that there is a lot of water but the entire problem is because of rampant corruption and other misconducts. The Tanker Mafia has been stealing the water which should be given to the people and selling it to rich people, whereas we are left here to suffer in the heat,"" Muneeb added.","The general public of Pakistan's Karachi currently suffer from severe effects of heatwave.

Despite strong reservations from Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the government on Thursday recalled these ambassadors, including Nepal's envoy to India Shankar Sharma, The Kathmandu Post newspaper reported.This comes ahead of Prime Minister Prachanda's likely visit to New Delhi on Sunday to witness Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony. Such a move sends a very undiplomatic message, multiple foreign ministry officials told the newspaper.Foreign Minister Shrestha had reportedly been opposing the proposal to recall ambassadors appointed in the quota for the Nepali Congress and other parties, but Prime Minister Dahal and CPN-UML Chairman Oli unilaterally decided to recall the ambassadors, a minister told the paper.Foreign Minister Shrestha reportedly told both Dahal and Oli not to recall all 11 envoys because the performance of some of them was good, the minister said. Dahal and Oli are learnt to have pressured Shrestha to accept the move which was later decided by the Cabinet.The decision was supposed to come from the foreign ministry but the Cabinet had endorsed it without much discussion. Shrestha opposed the decision in the Cabinet meeting too, sources said.The recalled ambassadors are Sharma (India), Sridhar Khatri (USA), Gyan Chandra Acharya (United Kingdom) and Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari (South Korea). They were appointed in the quotas allotted to the Nepali Congress when the party president Sher Bahadur Deuba headed the government in 2021. Sharma, Acharya and Khatri were recommended ambassadors in October, 2021.Other ambassadors whose terms were cut short are Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Qatar), Nawaraj Subedi (Saudi Arabia), Sharmila Parajuli Dhakal (Spain), Ram Swartha Ray Yadav (Denmark), Kanta Rizal (Israel), Dilliraj Poudel (Malaysia) and Salin Nepal (Portugal).Dhakal, Rizal and Nepal were also appointed in the Congress quota before the party left the Dahal-led government in March. Subedi and Yadav were recommended by the Janata Samajbadi Party. Dhakal was appointed in the quota for the Prachanda-led CPN (Maoist Centre) but her influence in the party was weak, sources claimed. Poudel was appointed in the quota for the CPN (Unified Socialist) but he failed to build a cordial relationship with Minister for Labour D P Aryal.The envoys have been given three to four weeks to return, according to a minister.","Nepal government has recalled ambassadors from 11 countries, including those serving in India and the US.

LONDON: Global payments processors visa and mastercard must face a new set of lawsuits over fees charged to retailers , after a London tribunal ruled on Friday that collective cases brought on behalf of merchants can proceed.

The two firms already face a long list of lawsuits in London over multilateral interchange fees, which retailers pay when consumers use a card to shop.

Visa and Mastercard are each being sued by hundreds of claimants at London's competition appeal tribunal , which is managing the various cases together.

Special purpose vehicle commercial and interregional card claims brought another set of lawsuits against visa and mastercard in 2022, seeking damages on behalf of merchants who were allegedly overcharged.

The tribunal initially refused to certify its cases under the United Kingdom 's collective proceedings' regime, which is similar to class actions in the United States.

However, the tribunal ruled on Friday that the cases would be certified, subject to any representations by other parties who might have an interest in the cases.

Leicester's Diwali festival under threat as council can't afford the costs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/leicesters-diwali-festival-under-threat-as-council-cant-afford-the-costs/articleshow/110776008.cms,"LONDON: Leicester’s Diwali celebrations — considered to be the largest outside India — could get cancelled as the city council which funds them can no longer afford the massive costs .

The two-day event, which consists of a spectacular switch-on of 6,000 LED lights shaped as diyas, on the Golden Mile and stage performances, fair rides and fireworks two weeks before Diwali, and then another event, including live music and a lantern procession on Diwali Day, costs Leicester city council £250,000 (Rs 2.6 crore).

Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby now says the £250,000 price tag is “unsustainable”. This has triggered Conservative Leicester East candidate Shivani Raja and former MP Keith Vaz to start petitions to the council calling for the celebrations, which attract over 40,000 people and benefit local businesses, to be saved.

A city council spokesperson said: “We recently met with members of the Leicester Hindu Festival Council and local ward councillors to advise them that funding for all of the council’s festivals and events is under review, owing to huge pressures on the council’s finances. Having announced last Sep that funding two events for Diwali was no longer sustainable, we’re now reviewing whether we can support even one event – which would cost £130k — without significant funding from elsewhere. It’s important to emphasise that no decisions have yet been made, but we wanted to be open with our partners while there’s still time to explore possible sources of alternative funding.”

Labour candidate for Leicester East Rajesh Agrawal said the issue was getting raised on the doorsteps during canvassing.“The council is under huge financial pressure ,” he said, “and the future of these celebrations is uncertain. We need more sources of funding. Having been deputy mayor of London, I know how important such events are to promote a city. I am determined to save them.”

As the public awaits any official statements, the potential change in Kate Middleton's role marks a significant moment for the royal family and its future.Kate's reduced presence at public engagements has been noticeable, with Prince William often attending events solo or with other senior royals. This change has led to numerous discussions among royal watchers and the media about the reasons behind her absence.One possible factor is the couple's desire to provide a more stable and private upbringing for their three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. The royal couple has always emphasized the importance of shielding their children from the relentless media attention that comes with their status.Additionally, there are reports suggesting that Kate Middleton is keen to pursue her personal interests and charitable endeavors without the constraints of her royal duties.

"Commission, Council, Parliament -- Who does what in the EU?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/commission-council-parliament-who-does-what-in-the-eu/articleshow/110811236.cms,"BRUSSELS: Trying to figure out what each of the main European Union institutions does is not easy.As EU citizens vote in four days of elections -- with most balloting happening Sunday -- we look at the bodies based in Brussels and elsewhere.- European Commission -The European Commission is the EU's executive arm. It is the only institution that can propose EU laws .The commission is responsible for enforcing EU law and represents the bloc in trade negotiations on behalf of member countries, which constitute a single market.The commission is also the EU's powerful antitrust regulator, with power to probe violations and impose hefty fines. The size and wealth of the bloc means EU competition laws influence other jurisdictions around the world in what is called the ""Brussels effect"".Around 32,000 people work for the commission, which is led by a president. All the EU commissioners, including the president, are collectively known as ""the college"" rather than the cabinet. Customarily there are as many commissioners as there are member states, with one from each.Under EU treaty law, the president is chosen by the bloc's leaders, ""taking into account"" the results of the European Parliament elections.The parliament -- which argues the commission president should come from the political grouping receiving the most votes -- needs to approve the leaders' choice via a simple majority.The current president is German conservative Ursula von der Leyen, from the leading European People's Party. She is seeking a second five-year mandate.There is also a ""high representative"" who coordinates foreign policy with member states. The role is currently held by Josep Borrell.- European Parliament -The parliament is the only EU institution directly elected by European citizens. It also has a five-year mandate, though its president -- in effect, speaker -- has a two-and-a-half-year term.There will be 720 lawmakers in the next parliament, compared with 705 in the outgoing one, to reflect demographic growth in the EU.The members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are responsible for adopting laws on a vast array of subjects, including trade deals, energy, the environment, migration and the bloc's budget, among others.Lawmakers negotiate the texts with member states, represented by the Council of the EU , before final adoption. The commission also takes part in the discussions.The parliament's official seat is in Strasbourg, France, where week-long plenary sessions are held nearly every month. But day-to-day work goes on in Brussels.- European Council -The European Council is made up of the EU heads of state and government.Leaders usually meet in Brussels four times a year for summits that frequently end in the early hours of the morning after drawn-out discussions. In exceptional cases they can go on for days.The leaders together shape the bloc's policy aims, handle politically sensitive issues and strike agreements on topics where their ministers were unable to reach an accord.The council's significance has grown as the EU has faced crisis after crisis, including the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.- Council of the EU -Not to be confused with the human rights watchdog the Council of Europe -- a pan-European body not part of the EU despite sharing the same flag -- the Council of the EU is the name given to EU ministers grouped together by portfolio.For example, the EU's 27 finance or agriculture or environment ministers gather for regular meetings, usually in Brussels but sometimes in Luxembourg. Each of those meetings is known as a Council of the EU meeting.Each EU country takes turns holding the six-month rotating presidency of the bloc to chair the ministers' meetings.The Council of the EU gives the green light to laws, usually by qualified majority -- which means at least 15 out of 27 EU nations must be in favour, as long as they account for at least 65 percent of the bloc's population.Foreign policy or taxation issues can only be adopted unanimously, giving each member state power of veto.- Other bodies -Navigating the acronymic alphabet soup for other EU bodies is no easy feat.There is the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).There are many bodies to enforce EU rules such as the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the Italy-based European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).And there's also the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).","The European Commission is the EU's executive arm.
