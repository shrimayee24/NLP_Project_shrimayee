"Maharashtra goes to polls today: Battle hinges on sops, jobs, quota & crop",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-goes-to-polls-today-battle-hinges-on-sops-jobs-quota-crop/articleshow/115467156.cms,"MUMBAI: Cash, Caste, Crop, and perhaps Community. That pretty much defines the main factors at play as Maharashtra heads into an election on Wednesday.This is the first assembly poll since the dramatic split of Shiv Sena and NCP, which led to major political realignments and comes barely six months after the Lok Sabha results in which the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi came out on top. Wresting 30 of the state's 48 seats, it left the governing Mahayuti reeling with a tally of 17, even though the difference in vote-share of the two fronts was less than 1%. In terms of leads, Mahayuti was ahead in 125 segments while the MVA was leading in 153.However, the Haryana verdict has given BJP and allies an impetus in the form of an unprecedented third term. They have since worked overtime to counter anti-incumbency in one of India's largest states. This includes carpet-bombing the electorate with sops, such as a monthly income support scheme, Mukhya Mantri Ladki Bahin Yojana, which is patterned on the Madhya Pradesh model. Five installments of Rs 1,500 have reached over 2.3 crore women.Its popularity is evident from the manifestos released by both fronts - they are offering even more sops for women. While Mahayuti has offered Rs 2,100 per month if it is voted back, MVA has offered a monthly stipend of Rs 3,000 under Mahalakshmi scheme.But will this counter public discontent over other issues? Low procurement prices for soyabean and cotton farmers can be a decisive factor in Vidarbha and Marathwada. During the Lok Sabha polls, Mahayuti faced a backlash in these regions. Inflation and unemployment also continue to simmer. Indeed, the opposition argues that rising prices counter the gains from the Ladki Bahin stipend.The opposition has also invoked Marathi asmita or pride by focusing on Adani group's presence in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project and the flight of industry and jobs from Maharashtra to Gujarat. Ajit Pawar's revelation that industrialist Gautam Adani had attended a meeting at his residence to discuss the possibility of a BJP-NCP govt in 2019 led to opposition allegations that the industrialist was involved in toppling the MVA govt.The Mahayuti campaign has also adopted a majoritarian theme by dropping terms such as ""vote jihad"" and ""dharma yuddh"" to counter the consolidation of Muslim votes in favour of MVA candidates. The BJP manifesto calls for an anti-conversion law. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath's slogan ""batenge to katenge"" gained usage as divisive propaganda for the BJP poll machine. PM Narendra Modi's slogan, ""ek hain toh safe hain"", was seen as an effort to moderate the tone.""In the Lok Sabha polls, the opposition set the narrative with its anti-Modi campaign and the threat of the Constitution being changed and the Mahayuti parties had to respond to it. In the state polls, the ruling parties seem to have set the narrative with the Ladki Bahin Yojana and the 'batenge to katenge' slogan and the opposition has had to respond to it,"" said senior journalist Abhay Deshpande.How crucial will caste be to the assembly poll results? In the LS polls, the agitation for Maratha quota led by activist Manoj Jarange led to defeat of BJP stalwarts including Raosaheb Danve and Pankaja Munde. Though he threatened to field candidates again this time, Jarange decided to stall. The issue may simmer and provoke a reaction from the OBC community. But BJP has increased outreach to OBCs, which are its core base.The splitting of the two major regional parties - Shiv Sena and NCP - continues to cast its shadow over the state. Indeed, the unlikely post-poll alliances and changes in govt have led voters to question the value of their vote.Shiv Sena of Eknath Shinde and Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) are pitted in direct contests on 51 seats. A similar war will rage between NCP (Sharad Pawar group) and Ajit Pawar's NCP in 36 seats. It's unclear if the parent party in both cases will gain public sympathy. The party that loses out could face an exodus or political oblivion.Rebel candidates could queer the pitch for both fronts. And small parties and Independents, too, will play a key role in close contests. The smaller parties include Maharashtra Navnirman Sena of Raj Thackeray, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi led by Prakash Ambedkar, the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh led by Mahadev Jankar, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi led by Hitendra Thakur.Whichever alliance wins will have to face the challenge of managing the state's precarious financial condition. Debt is upward of Rs 7.8 lakh crore. Fiscal deficit is expected to be Rs 2 lakh crore, much beyond norm. And dropping schemes after winning the poll will not be an easy task.","This is the first assembly poll since the dramatic split of Shiv Sena and NCP.

"G20 declaration avoids slamming Russia, omits PM's 'no era for war' message",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g20-declaration-avoids-slamming-russia-omits-pms-no-era-for-war-message/articleshow/115466612.cms,"Rio Declaration slams terrorism but doesn’t dwell on it at length

NEW DELHI: For the second year in succession, the G20 declaration refrained from explicitly condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine while diluting further the support for Kyiv amid pressure from the incoming Trump administration to end the war.While G20 Delhi Declaration too was seen as soft on Russia, focused as it was more on social consequences of the war than on holding Moscow liable, it had seven paragraphs dedicated to addressing the situation as against just one specifically on Ukraine in the Rio Declaration. The western powers also agreed to omit from the Rio Declaration PM Modi's big message to Russian President Vladimir Putin - this isn't the era of war - that found mention in both Bali and Delhi joint statements.The Delhi declaration, which India dramatically pulled off through an eleventh-hour consensus, had a standalone paragraph that just said today’s era must not be of war. The same sentence had been used earlier in 2022 Bali declaration.The summit took place against the backdrop of a likely escalation in the war with the US having approved use of long-range missiles by Ukraine against Russia. While seeking a comprehensive ceasefire, the Rio joint communique recalled discussions in New Delhi and highlighted human suffering and negative added impacts of the war with regard to global food and energy security, supply chains, macro-financial stability, inflation and growth. “We welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just and durable peace, upholding all purposes and principles of UN Charter for promotion of peaceful, friendly, and good neighbourly relations,” it said.The Delhi joint statement, which was endorsed by Russia as a more balanced outcome, had omitted the text from the previous G20 declaration referring to demand for complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russia from Ukraine. However, even without naming Russia, it said the threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. Like Delhi, Rio did call upon all States to refrain from threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state.India’s position on issues like terrorism and money laundering was also better reflected in the Delhi Declaration that addressed the issue at length, saying that terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The Rio Declaration only said the leaders condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.","For the second year in succession, the G20 declaration refrained from explicitly condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

NEW DELHI: In a move that signalled FBI's interest in Vikash Yadav but also left many here perplexed, the US probe agency appears to have intensified its efforts to get hold of the sacked R&AW operative by also issuing his ""wanted"" posters in Punjabi and Hindi.The FBI website already had the poster of Yadav, who allegedly masterminded the botched plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , under the ""wanted"" head in English. The notice left many intrigued as Yadav is not absconding, with Indian authorities informing their US counterparts that he was in jail for alleged robbery and is currently out on bail.FBI’s unusual interest in catching Yadav appears to have stemmed from rumours spread by Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun that Vikash Yadav could be located within the territories of Haryana and Punjab, sources said.Yadav has been indicted in a New York court in the Pannun murder-for-hire plot in which FBI has also arrested an Indian origin alleged drug dealer named Nikhil Gupta.Gupta was detained by Czech Republic authorities at Prague airport in June last year on the US govt’s request. He was accused of allegedly working with an undercover cop and hiring a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) informant to kill Pannun. Gupta was subsequently handed over to US authorities around the first week of Nov 2023, shortly before an indictment was filed in a New York court.While FBI’s efforts show Yadav is a top priority for US law enforcement, his arrest and subsequent extradition may not be an easy task. Indian government is likely to reiterate its demand about two pending extraditions. While one is former DEA informant David Coleman Headley, aka Dawood Gilani, an operative of LeT who conducted recce for the gang that carried out 26/11 rampage in Mumbai, the other is Tahawwur Rana, also wanted in the same case.","The FBI website already had the poster of Yadav, who allegedly masterminded the botched plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.

Severe Air Quality Alert in Punjab: Visibility Drops to Zero Amid Smog and Fog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/severe-air-quality-alert-in-punjab-visibility-drops-to-zero-amid-smog-and-fog/articleshow/115346589.cms,"We also published the following articles recently

Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers as smog reduces visibility

Despite Delhi's air quality index (AQI) hitting a severe level of 428, Delhi Airport assures passengers that flight operations remain normal. Low visibility procedures are in effect, and travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight updates. The India Meteorological Department predicts stronger winds will improve air quality to a 'very poor' level.

Watch: Ghazipur landfill vanishes! Season's first fog deepens smog in Delhi, lowering visibility

Delhi woke to its first thick fog of the season, reducing visibility to zero in some areas and shrouding landmarks like the Ghazipur landfill. This severely impacted air travel, with flights diverted from Delhi Airport due to near-zero visibility. The fog also aggravated respiratory issues for residents already grappling with 'severe' air quality, as reported by the IMD and CPCB.

BATHINDA: There was little respite in air quality in Punjab on Friday as compared to the previous day — amid visibility at the lowest ebb — even as smog and fog remained comparatively for less time in the morning.The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for fog on Saturday.Though it was less hazy than Thursday, the sun was not visible throughout the day.For most part of the day, the AQI stayed under the ‘poor’ category and ‘moderate’ at times.Zero visibility was recorded at Amritsar and Chandigarh airports till 8.30 am.The visibility was recorded at 10 metres in Patiala, 50 metres in Halwara and Faridkot, 100 metres in Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Ludhiana.The worsening air quality is forcing people to remain indoors which is also impacting the election campaigning in Barnala and Gidderbaha.A number of functionaries, belonging to different political parties, said they had to reach out to people at their doorsteps or business establishments with very few people attending public meetings amid worsening air quality.The activity time in the day has shortened as the day starts after 9am and thick smog or fog starts descending early in the evening especially in the rural and outer areas.Advisories have been issued asking older people to avoid venturing out.Commuters have been asked to travel during the day and reach their destinations early in the evening.","Air quality index (AQI) hits a severe level of 428 in Delhi.

Why some families are returning adopted kids in Tamil Nadu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/why-some-families-are-returning-adopted-kids-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/115363248.cms,"As soon as they heard from the nursing home that their surrogate had delivered a healthy baby, the adoptive parents (name withheld) informed the adoption agency of their decision to return the 8and 10-year-old siblings they had adopted a few months earlier. The children, who are now back in the adoption home, will be counselled for foster care or placement in a govt home where they may grow up as orphans.Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies for different reasons. Four parents quoted “adjustment issues” as a reason for returning children. While one parent thought the toddler did not make enough eye contact during conversation another felt the child had anger issues. Some parents quoted marital or financial problems within the family, and others cited the child’s poor health. In one case it was the death of a parent. Officials confirmed that while three of them have been re-adopted, one is in foster care and the remaining still in govt homes.The social welfare department has recorded three dissolutions of adoption in 2020, four in 2021 and five in 2023. Protocols , however, are now being implemented to ensure they don’t happen again. “We counsel parents at least twice to see if we can help them retain the child. In some cases, we know parents may not have a choice. The adoption process is then dissolved to declare the adoption void,” says social welfare secretary Jayashree Muralidharan .An authorised agency applies for dissolution to the district magistrate through the district child protection unit. Once the process is completed, the child is back on the list of those “legally free” for adoption. “Considering the long wait list, most children get another chance quickly,” says Muralidharan . “In general, most adoptions are successful. Dissolutions, however, have become unavoidable due to various reasons in some cases.”Psychiatrists say parents who surrender adopted children cannot be villainised as they are seeing a rise in “adaptive challenges” for different reasons. First, as adopted children identified with early stressful childhood, many parents seek consultations for “behaviour issues” after complaints from siblings, neighbours and schools. “It’s tough on the child as well as the parent. Until some years ago, most adoptions happened within the family. A couple who do not have children will adopt their nephews or nieces, or from families known to them. The joint family system monitored the upbringing of the adopted child,” says child psychiatrist Dr V Jayanthini.Today, information about biological parents is unknown in most cases, she says. “Mothers may not have had a happy pregnancy period. They may have neglected their diet and medical care, resulting in little bonding between the mother and the child after birth. All this can be stressful for the child. When they come to new homes the process of adapting themselves may add to this stress. While in many cases they tend to settle in with love and care, some children and parents just don’t get along.”In such cases, children show pat terns of uncooperative and defiant behaviour (disruptive disorder), or they are always angry, irritable, argumentative or defiant (oppositional defiant disorder) or may express disregard for others (conduct disorders). In some cases, children may be diagnosed with neurodevelopment disorders such as autism. “I have seen such children in my clinics. They show less interest in education, pick up habits such as use of tobacco and alcohol in early teens. Some are at risk of self-harm too,” she says.Genetics also plays a role. Studies have shown adoptees have a small but known risk for depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, says psychiatrist Dr R Thara, vice-chairman of Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF). “It is not easy for parents to return the child too. We have seen cases where they do after making several attempts to build the family,” she says.The social welfare department says it ensures all adoptive parents return the child without legal battles. “Our focus is on the child. The child should not feel unwanted or grow up in a place where he or she is not loved enough,” says Muralidharan.Every year, about 400 children are adopted from nearly 4,000 waiting at homes authorised by Child Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) in Tamil Nadu. “The average waiting time for parents is three to five years,” says a caretaker at an adoption home. Every resident Indian prospective adoptive parent (PAP), who intends to adopt a child must register online in the Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System by applying in a prescribed format with relevant documents. “It is an intensive process. There is a home study report to evaluate parents,” says a govt social worker.The physical and mental health conditions of the parents are evaluated as a part of the pre-adoption checklist. The govt also ensures adoptive parents are financially capable and have not been convicted in criminal cases. “There are stringent age regulations,” says the social worker. While couples must be married at least for two years, single men are allowed to adopt only boys. The age of the child allotted to a parent depends on the composite age of the parent. For instance, to adopt a child less than two years of age, the composite age of the parent must be 85 years and for children between two and four composite ages of parents must be 90 years.Parents also get to see three children before they make a choice. “They may reject children who are unhealthy or disabled. Sometimes parents feel the child does not resemble them. If they don’t choose to be shown three options, they may go behind in the waiting list,” says a social welfare official.Experts feel the state must consider introducing changes to bring down cases of dissolution. For instance, Dr Thara says it is important to screen children before giving them up for adoption. “Screening should include a detailed history such as heart disease, epilepsy and diabetes in the family so that they can be detected early and treated. A proper history of mental health conditions such as alcoholism, personality issues, and schizophrenia in the family is equally critical for the new families to be vigilant about symptoms. Disparity in educational and socio-economic status can also make the child uneasy and maladjusted,” she says. This may be difficult to do as the state may often have very little family history about abandoned or surrendered children. “So, those sent for read option must have details of the problems faced by the first adoptive parents. This is to ensure children do go through trauma again and parents know what they are going to face,” says Dr Thara.","Since 2020, about 12 parents in Tamil Nadu have returned children – less than 10 years old – who they legally adopted through various govt-certified agencies.

"Delhi's 2nd-worst air day on record, SC says Grap-4 to go on till further orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citys-2nd-worst-air-day-on-record-sc-says-grap-4-to-go-on-till-further-orders/articleshow/115430775.cms,"'Provide for more stringent actions under

GRAP III

, IV'

New Delhi: With air pollution in Delhi reaching life-threatening 'severe plus' levels, Supreme Court on Monday directed Delhi and NCR states - UP, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab - to strictly enforce stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and immediately take a call on measures such as closing schools for all classes, allowing govt and private employees to work from home and shutting industries.It also ordered that these restrictions would continue till further orders from the court, even if AQI drops below 401, the 'severe' category threshold.The judicial crackdown came on a day when Delhi suffered a dystopian nightmare with a thick layer of pungent smoke filling the air. The day's average AQI was 494 at the highest end of 'severe-plus', the worst in eight years and the second-worst on record. The 24-hour average AQI maxed out at 500 at 15 stations at 5pm and citizens were left coughing and teary-eyed even on short exposures to the toxic fumes.The bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih slammed the ""wait and watch"" approach of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in enforcing Grap measures. Noting that grade III measures were enforced 48 hours after AQI level crossed 400 level, it directed that commensurate measures must be enforced immediately after the AQI level crosses the threshold and the commission should not wait for improvement in quality of air on the basis of the met department's forecast. SC administration also issued a circular in the evening advising all, including lawyers and judges to wear masks.Pleading for closure of all classes in schools, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan brought to court's notice that Delhi govt was allowing physical classes for classes 10 and 12, and contended that same number of school buses were running on roads to ferry them. The court, thereafter, ordered, ""States should take an immediate call to stop physical classes of all standards up to class 12.""Meanwhile, UP govt told the SC that it had invoked Grap-4 measures from 8am onwards on Monday.We direct all govts of NCR to strictly implement stage 4 of Grap. All states will immediately constitute teams for monitoring implementations of actions required under stage 4. NCR governments and the Centre will have to immediately take a call on actions provided in clauses 6 (allowing public, municipal and private offices to work on 50% strength and the rest to work from home), 7 (decision on permitting Central govt employee work from home) and 8 (closure of educational institutions, non-emergency commercial activities and plying of vehicles on odd-even basis etc) of stage 4 and place the decision taken on the record before the next date,"" the bench said.The bench also directed CAQM to incorporate more stringent actions in stages 3 and 4 of Grap, and not leave its implementation to the discretion of the government or local authorities. SC said that CAQM's should be preemptive and it should not wait to enforce measures, after senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, said that AQI had breached 400 in November 12 itself but Grap 3 measures were enforced after 48 hours.""From the submissions made across the bar and from minutes of the meeting dated November 13, 2024, we find that the approach adopted by the sub-committee of the commission is contrary to what is observed in paragraph three of this court's order dated October 29, 2018. The direction was to EPCA to take preemptive steps under Grap. The approach adopted by the commission seems to be that they have decided to wait for improvement of AQI and therefore implementation of stage 3 and stage 4 was delayed. This is completely a wrong approach,"" the court said.It also directed the states to create grievance redressal mechanisms to enable the citizens to lodge complaints of violation of actions under stage 4 and ordered them to file an affidavit on compliance of all its directions by Thursday and posted the case for further hearing on November 22.","Air pollution in Delhi reaches life-threatening'severe plus' levels.

GANDHINAGAR: The Centre will strive to ensure that all undertrials who have served one-third of the maximum sentence for the offence they are charged with receive justice before Constitution Day is celebrated, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday. The adoption of the Constitution is commemorated on November 26.Shah said, ""We have put in place 60 provisions for the court, the prosecution and police to complete their work within a time limit. We have also made provision for jails so that if a trial is not going on after a certain period, then - except for non-serious crimes - the jail officer will have to present the bail process inside the court.""It is our effort that before Constitution Day, there should not be a single prisoner in the country’s jails who has served one-third of his sentence and has not yet got justice. A lot of work has gone in to make police accountable and a lot has been done to give strength to police,” Shah said at 50th All India Police Science Conference.The home minister also said India and the world face the challenges of cybercrime, infiltration, illegal use of drones, narcotics and misuse of the dark web, and India will have to take the lead in finding solutions to these challenges. He added that law enforcement agencies will have to stay a step ahead of criminals in these five areas.“These five areas will be a challenge not just for India but for the whole world,” Shah told about 250 delegates at the conference, organised by Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D).He said AIPSC should work towards analysing data to bring about changes in the system to reduce crime, its investigation and speedy justice. “AIPSC needs to use AI to make data result-oriented and more effective,” Shah said.Commenting on three new criminal laws that were passed earlier this year, Shah said the home ministry made extensive preparations before implementing the three new laws. “Following their implementation, justice will be delivered to people from SC level within three years from the date of registration of a first information report (FIR),” Shah added.He said 70,000 police stations were connected to CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems), 22,000 courts through e-courts, data of 2 crore prisoners is stored in e-prisons system and that of over 1.5 crore prosecution in e-prosecution system, more than 23 lakh forensic data in e-forensic, among other things.","The adoption of the Constitution is commemorated on November 26.

"After disengagement, India and China agree on next steps to normalise ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-disengagement-india-and-china-agree-on-next-steps-to-normalise-ties/articleshow/115462813.cms,"NEW DELHI: With disengagement at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh having proceeded without a hitch, India and China focused on taking the next steps in normalising Sino-Indian ties as external affairs minister S Jaishankar met his counterpart Wang Yi in Rio on the margins of the G20 summit.According to an Indian readout, the steps discussed - in what was the first high-level meeting since PM Narendra Modi met President Xi Jinping in Kazan on October 23 and endorsed the disengagement agreement reached days earlier - included resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , data sharing on trans-border rivers, resumption of direct flights and media exchanges.“In Kazan, our leaders reached a consensus on taking next steps on our relationship, bearing in mind the understanding of 21 October. I am glad to note that on the ground, the implementation of that understanding has proceeded as planned,” said Jaishankar in the meeting with Wang. Interestingly, Jaishankar did not use the word agreement that Indian officials had used earlier while describing the LAC patrolling arrangements leading to disengagement. China has also not used the word agreement so far but has called it a resolution.While talking about the importance of the resumption of ties following the ""successful"" Kazan meeting for not just the people of India and China but also the Global South, Wang called for sending more “positive signals” like facilitating visas as soon as possible, enhancing trust and nursing “less suspicion”. The Chinese foreign ministry said separately that the relationship is now at a new starting point.The Indian government also said the ministers recognized that the disengagement in border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquillity which India sees as essential for normalisation of the relationship. Both sides agreed that a meeting of the Special Representatives on the Boundary Question and of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Minister mechanism will take place soon.“The two Ministers felt that it was imperative that the focus should be on stabilizing ties, managing differences and taking the next steps,’’ said the Indian government.According to the Indian government, Jaishankar told Wang that India is strongly committed to a multipolar world, including a multipolar Asia, as he noted the contributions by both India and China to BRICS and G20 formats and in shaping their eventual outcomes. “Where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance,’’ said the Indian minister, adding India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations amid concerns in Beijing about India’s growing ties with the US.On the global situation and international issues, Jaishankar noted that India and China have both differences and convergences, while underlining constructive cooperation in not just Brics and the SCO framework but also G20.

NEW DELHI: Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) Member of Parliament Supriya Sule has submitted a cybercrime complaint to the Election Commission of India , after being accused of using bitcoin to finance the current Maharashtra Assembly elections . The complaint targets Gaurav Mehta and former Indian Police Service officer from Pune, Ravindranath Patil.""Familiar tactics of spreading false information to manipulate the righteous voters are being resorted to, a night before the polling day. We have filed a criminal complaint to the Hon’ble ECI & the Cyber crime department against the fake allegations made of bitcoin misappropriation ,"" she said.""The intent and mala fide actors behind it are amply evident, condemn worthy that such practices are taking place in a healthy democracy guided by the Constitution of India,"" added Sule while posting a copy of the complaint letter addressed to EC on social media.As the claims on bitcoin misuse went public, BJP also held a press conference demanding answers from the MVA. In a press conference, BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""An accused dealer contacts a former police officer who has been jailed earlier due to some allegations and tells him that he (the alleged dealer) wants to do some transactions of bitcoin in cash. The police officer declines his request. But the dealer tries to convince him as few 'big people' are involved in this matter and he allegedly takes the names of Nana Patole and Supriya Sule. When the police officer doesn't show any trust in this, the dealer sends him the audio clips. As per the claims of the dealer, there is mention of the need for money for the elections in those audio clips.""Then, he directly called out Congress saying, ""Now, we want to ask 5 questions to the Congress Party, one, are you involved in the bitcoin transaction? Second, are you in contact with this person named Gaurav Gupta or Mehta? Third, the chats are yours (of your leaders) or not? Fourth, the audio in the audio clips is yours or not? Fifth, who are the 'big people'?""This comes as former Pune IPS officer from Ravindranath Patil, levelled the accusations against Supriya Sule and Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole, claiming they misused bitcoins from a 2018 Cryptocurrency Fraud Case to finance the current Maharashtra Assembly Elections. Patil indicates his willingness to assist with investigations.In his statement to ANI, Patil implicated Amitabh Gupta , former Police Commissioner of Pune, and Bhagyashri Nautake, former Deputy Commissioner handling Cyber Crime Investigations, in the alleged bitcoin misappropriation scheme benefiting the political leaders. According to Patil, the cryptocurrency funds were utilised during the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra.""My company called me as a cryptocurrency expert to investigate a case in 2018. I was arrested in that case in 2022 under allegations of fraud. I spent 14 months in jail after a trial. During that time, I was wondering what had happened, what the case was and why was I trapped. There were other colleagues also with me. We were working on finding out the truth. A witness against us, Gaurav Mehta, who is an employee of an audit firm named Sarathi Associates. A day before yesterday, he called me multiple times for 4-5 hours, but I did not respond.""He then further added, ""Finally, when I responded, he told me that in 2018, when Amit Bharadwaj was arrested, he had a cryptocurrency hardware wallet... That wallet was replaced by the then Commissioner Amitabh Gupta and another wallet was kept. We were arrested but the real perpetrators were Amitabh Gupta and his team. He (Gaurav Mehta) took the names of two IPS officers, Amitabh Gupta and Bhagyashri Nautake. He took two people's name one is Supriya Sule and Nana Patole. He then told me that in this assembly elections bitcoins are being used.""Patil further revealed that he possesses voice recordings from Gaurav Mehta and said, ""Supriya Sule has sent three voice note messages in which she is heard asking Gaurav to encash bitcoins as the funds are needed for the elections. She is also heard assuring him not to worry about the inquiries and one they come to power, they will handle them.""""He (Gaurav Mehta) further said that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections too, the same bitcoin money is being used. On the direction of Amitabh Gupta, he (Gaurav Mehta) went to Dubai multiple times and converted the bitcoin into cash. And that cash is being used in Maharashtra elections... He (Gaurav Mehta) sent me some voice notes he had received on WhatsApp. There were 3 audio messages from Supriya Sule where she asks for cash in exchange for bitcoins. She also says that he (Gaurav Mehta) does not need to worry about inquiry, they will handle it when they come to power... He (Gaurav Mehta) sent another voice note between Amitabh Gupta and Nana Patole where Patole is asking why there is a delay in cash.""Patil additionally claims that recordings exist of ""Amitabh Gupta giving instructions to Gaurav to cash out bitcoins."" ""He (Gaurav) sent me more recordings where Amitabh Gupta was asking for Rs. 50 crores... He sent me a voice note he sent to Amitabh Gupta, saying that they had made 4 crypto wallets under the names of Patil and Ghode (my colleague) and the transactions were done from these wallets. If there is an investigation, Patil and Ghode would be caught... During the chat with me, he (Gaurav Mehta) alleged that he wanted to come out of this but his life would be in danger... I have all the screenshots and the audio and I am ready to provide them to the investigation agencies. I am ready to support the investigation.""Patil received this information from a whistle-blower who participated in investigating the 2018 Cryptocurrency Fraud Case. He asserts that Gaurav Mehta currently controls misappropriated bitcoins worth hundreds of crores of rupees. ""He said that they have already sold bitcoins worth Rs. 150 crores and they have several 100 crores more... The cash was used in Lok Sabha elections and is not being used in assembly elections also.""","Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) Member of Parliament Supriya Sule has submitted a cybercrime complaint to the Election Commission of India.

Data from US consulate-general, Hyderabad, show that nearly 56% of Indian students who packed their bags for the US last year were from the two states - with 34% from Telangana and 22% from Andhra.The number of US students enrolled in Indian institutions increased 300% over the previous year.These details were shared by Hyderabad's US consular chief Rebekah Drame and public affairs officer Alexander McLaren during a visit to Visakhapatnam Tuesday. Although they did not divulge the exact number of students from Telangana and Andhra, it could be around 1.8 lakh as India sent nearly 3.3 lakh students to the US in 2023.""The demand for visas in India is insatiable. Last year we processed 1.4 million visas. While this represents just a tenth of a percent of the population, it is still an impressive number. No other country (consulate) operating in India has processed as many visas,"" Drame said.The consular chief added: ""Over the past year and a half, our staff in Hyderabad more than doubled. By early 2025, we expect the team to nearly triple in size. Currently, we process about 1,600 visas per day, and this number is likely to increase to around 2,500 by Jan or Feb next year- potentially even more after that...""The Hyderabad consulate conducted over 47,000 student visa interviews during the 2024 summer student visa season, up from 35,000 in 2023.Public affairs officer McLaren cited the US's Open Doors report released Monday highlighting the surge in numbers of Indian students. ""This year India ranked as the number one country sending students to the US. Most Indian students are men pursuing master's degrees. Expanding enrolments in undergraduate programmes could help diversify the student body,"" said McLaren.Drame flagged other visa measures. ""One remarkable pilot programme was H-1B domestic revalidation initiative. For three months, 10,000 appointments were made available for H-1B holders residing in the US, allowing them to renew their visas without travelling back to India. This was successful and we are confident Washington will reinstate it as a regular programme next year,"" he added.",Nearly 56% of Indian students who packed their bags for the US last year were from the two states. 34% from Telangana and 22% from Andhra.

Agnipath shadow over Army chief's visit to Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnipath-shadow-over-army-chiefs-visit-to-nepal/articleshow/115428469.cms,"NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week to reinforce the deep-rooted bilateral military ties, which have come under a cloud after Kathmandu refused to allow its youth to join the Indian armed forces under the Agnipath scheme , even as China assiduously continues to make deep strategic inroads into the landlocked Himalayan country.Gen Dwivedi, during his visit from Nov 20 to 24, will focus on further cranking up the long-standing close military collaboration between the two armies, ranging from combat exercises and training programmes to modernization and capacity-building.This year alone, for instance, over 300 Nepal Army personnel have been trained in Indian military establishments, while New Delhi has also been supporting Kathmandu in its military modernization by supplying hardware and software, including small arms, vehicles, and advanced training simulators.The scope and complexity of the annual Surya Kiran joint military exercise, the 18th edition of which will be held in Nepal next month, is also being expanded to enhance the interoperability and synergy between the two armies.Gen Dwivedi will also be conferred with the honorary rank of General of Nepal Army during the visit, as per a long-standing tradition. The elephant in the room, however, will be the intractable differences over the recruitment of soldiers for just four years, without pension or ex-servicemen benefits, under the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022.“Taking the Covid-19 pandemic also into account, Nepal-domicile Gorkhas have not been recruited into the Indian Army, including the seven illustrious regiments of the Gorkha Rifles, for almost five years now. This does not augur well for bilateral relations. The two govts must work out a mutually acceptable solution,” a senior officer told TOI.This becomes especially important given China’s fast-expanding arc of influence in Nepal, which has also hopped onto the former’s Belt and Road Initiative. Moreover, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli is slated to head for China early next month on his first bilateral foreign visit, in yet another break from long-standing tradition of visiting India first.It was in 1947 that the Indian Army began recruiting Nepalese Gorkhas under the Tripartite Agreement signed with Nepal and the UK. There are currently around 30,000 Nepali citizens serving in the Indian Army, with another 90,000 ex-servicemen also drawing their pensions from the force.The Gorkha Rifles are now trying to step-up recruitment of Indian-domicile Gorkhas from Darjeeling, Dehradun, Dharamshala and other places, who are supposed to constitute 40% of the troops, as well as some Garhwalis and Kumaonis but are finding it extremely difficult to meet the shortfall.“The future looks bleak. In another 10-11 years, the last of the Nepali Gorkhas will retire from our Army,” another officer said. That will end the rich legacy and strong ties that originally began when Maharaja Ranjit Singh first raised a battalion of Gorkhas to serve in his Army around 1809-1814, with the British Army following suit soon after.","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi will be on a four-day visit to Nepal this week.

""The scheme aspires to provide 100% ownership to women in the second phase,"" the senior official said.PMAY will complete eight years on Wednesday, having been launched by PM Narendra Modi in 2016 in Agra.Importantly, Union rural development ministry is launching a fresh survey - Awas-Plus 2024 - to identify the beneficiaries for the second phase, with the provision of ""self survey"" to weed out the oft-heard grievances of households that they were left out by the surveyors. The option would involve the interested person uploading his image for ""face-based authentication"" and other credentials on the app.The survey has 10 criteria on the basis of which an aspirant would become eligible under the scheme. While govt has a ready list of 1.2 crore beneficiaries, the survey would identify remaining 80 lakh persons to complete the two crore target for the second phase from 2024-29. However, the surplus names identified would be on the list for future.The original list of beneficiaries was based on SECC 2011, after which it was updated through an ""Awas-Plus 2018"" survey.The RD ministry has directed the states to finish the surveys by November 30, and sanction housing for eligible families by December 31.

We should not miss a single prisoner who is eligible for grant of bail under Section 479 of Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS).""""Jail superintendents must undertake a special drive to identify women undertrial prisoners, some of whom may be lodged with their young children, would be eligible for bail under Section 479,"" the bench said.After hearing amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal and NALSA counsel Rashmi Nandkumar, who placed statistics about implementation of SC's earlier orders directing expeditious release of undertrial prisoners, the bench expressed surprise over many undertrials, who are first time offenders, not being granted bail by trial courts.Section 479 provides: Those undertrial prisoners, not facing charges in heinous offences attracting a maximum punishment of life/death sentence, would be released on bail if they have served one-third of the maximum imprisonment prescribed for the offence (first time offenders) or half of the maximum period of imprisonment (for other accused undertrials). However, it provided that those facing trial in multiple cases cannot avail this liberal bail provision.SC had also in its earlier orders mandated compliance of Section 479(3), which provided, ""The superintendent of jail, where the accused person is detained, on completion of one-half or one-third of the period of incarceration, shall forthwith make an application in writing to the Court to proceed for the release of such person on bail.

The ""mirror award"", therefore, cannot carry M S Subbulakshmi's name.The judge was passing the order on a plea moved by V Shrinivasan, grandson of Carnatic legend MS Subbulakshmi that contended that conferring the award on Krishna would amount to awarding a ""Bhakti"" prize to an atheist, considering the ""vile, vituperative, and scandalous"" attacks made by him against the late Subbulakshmi.In his ruling on Tuesday, Justice Jayachandran said: ""The best way to honour a departed soul is to respect her wish and not disrespect it,"" pointing to her desire not to institute any award in her name. ""Applying the armchair rule in family law, the plaintiff, who is the grandson of the late singer, as a beneficiary of her will, has interest in the matter and locus to maintain the suit,"" the court added.According to Shrinivasan, after the demise of his grandmother in 2004, the academy, along with an English daily, instituted a cash award in 2005 of Rs 1 lakh styled as the ""Sangita Kalanidhi M S Subbulakshmi Award"" to perpetuate her memory.It was awarded every year together with the Music Academy's Sangita Kalanidhi Award during its annual concert season. On March 17 the academy issued a press release announcing the conferment of the award on T M Krishna at its 98th annual conference in Dec, the petitioner said.

However, Parliament had amended the Article in 2001 to defer the readjustment of allocation of seats in Lok Sabha to states till after the census of 2031. However, it provided that the delimitation exercise of assembly constituencies would be based on the 2001 census.A PIL filed in 2022 had alleged that no delimitation exercise has been conducted for the states of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh since 1971. The delimitation exercise for Assam was carried out in the recent past, but not for the other three NE states.Appearing for the Union govt, additional solicitor general (ASG) K M Nataraj told a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar that the law and order situation in Manipur as well as strong opposition from several tribes in Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland for the delimitation exercise is under consideration.The bench asked, ""Can you defer the delimitation exercise indefinitely in breach of the mandate of the constitutional provision? We can understand the law and order situation in Manipur. What about Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland?"" Ethnic violence has been continuing in Manipur since May last year.Nataraj said there are serious objections from tribes of these states about the sudden suspicious increase in population in some districts, as per the 2001 census, and their assemblies have passed resolutions against taking the 2001 census data as the basis for the delimitation exercise. NE states in the last two decades have seen large-scale illegal migration from Bangladesh, which has impacted their demography.The ASG said the matter is under active consideration of the govt.

That order cannot be passed."" However, it said that if the man has contracted a second marriage during the subsistence of the first one, then he would face prosecution and punishment if found guilty by a court.The bench allowed the women's counsel to provide evidence to substantiate her allegation about her husband contracting a second marriage. It posted the matter for hearing in the third week of December.In the other case, the woman had allegedly deserted her husband voluntarily. According to the evidence placed by the husband's counsel Suchit Mohanty, she first eloped with another man and later started residing at her parental home. Mohanty cited the daughter's evidence to make his case good.However, the woman's counsel Suresh C Tripathy claimed a higher alimony while alleging that she was forced to leave the matrimonial home because of harassment and torture. Tripathy also said that his client's father is retired and most of his pension goes to meet healthcare expenses. Even though Mohanty said that the husband is ready to take his estranged wife back, the bench directed him to continue to pay Rs 7,000 per month as maintenance till the family court decides the plea for divorce.","Supreme Court adopts contrasting approaches to do complete justice in two matrimonial cases.

There's tremendous pressure from all over the country, from all sections of society, including from the Muslim community, to pass this bill,"" the minister said in an exclusive interaction.The winter session begins on Nov 25 and Rijiju emphasised that the Joint Parliamentary Committee, an all-party body which examined the legislation in detail, has been mandated to submit its findings to Parliament by the last day of the first week of the session.""After this, the bill will be debated and put to vote,"" the minister said, his assertion dispelling any doubt that the opposition's protests, inside the JPC and outside, might lead the govt to pause. ""Members of opposition parties enthusiastically participated in proceedings, made suggestions and were part of all the field trips, barring one to West Bengal, organised to familiarise members of the panel with the working of waqf bodies,"" the minister said.Rijiju, also the minority affairs minister, said the provisions of the bill to regulate functioning of waqf bodies, which preside over properties worth several lakhs of crore, were also debated among the public, with the minority affairs ministry receiving more than a lakh representations, an overwhelming majority of them being in support of the legislation. The govt has claimed that the proposed reforms will bring transparency in the functioning of waqf boards, which together hold land next only to the defence ministry and the railways.Notices issued to properties belonging to Christians in Kerala and farmers in Karnataka only served to put the spotlight on the arbitrary functioning of waqf bodies as well as how the changes carried out by the UPA govt in waqf tribunals have conferred vast powers on them, with little accountability.In the last monsoon session, the govt had introduced two bills - the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, in Lok Sabha on Aug 8, proposing reforms in functioning of waqf boards and their management of properties.Rijiju said the reforms were long pending and necessary as these bodies were being controlled by certain Muslim elites while the poor and a large population from the community were deprived of their benefits.","Waqf amendment bill will be passed in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament, says Kiren Rijiju.

Questions were raised as to why he did not step away from running his firms while he was looking for people who would be appointed to agencies which oversee and regulate such businesses.Lutnick gained national attention when 658 of his employees and his brother died in the 2001 World Trade Center attack. He rebuilt Cantor Fitzgerald almost from ashes.63-year-old Lutnick had been in the running to be Treasury secretary but Donald Trump reportedly soured on him due to infighting between Lutnick and other prominent candidates for the job, including financier Scott Bessent.Fox Business reported that Lutnick was offered an ambassadorship but he declined that offer. ""It's a free for all for Treasury secretary and there's a mad dash to find someone pro-tariff to lead the Treasury with Lutnic being tapped to lead the commerce department,"" the report said.In being tapped for Commerce, Lutnick edged out Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative during Trump’s first term, and Linda McMahon, an administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019, for the role. Both were informed in the last day or so that Lutnick was getting the job, CNN reported.McMahon who co-chaired the transition with Lutnick was a clear favorite for the commerce secretary post but then Lighthizer appeared closer to getting it. And now all reports claim it is Lutnick.""McMahon had become frustrated that Trump hadn’t named her to the Commerce role last week, when it became clear he was considering Lighthizer and thinking of an ambassador position for her instead. Then, she was abruptly informed that her transition co-chair was actually being awarded the Commerce job,"" CNN reported.","Howard Lutnick is likely to be the new commerce secretary of Donald Trump's administration, reports said Tuesday.

Air pollution impact: 50% spike in breathing disorders in Bhopal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/air-pollution-impact-50-spike-in-breathing-disorders-in-bhopal/articleshow/115470442.cms,"Breathless in Bhopal? GMC sees surge in patients

BHOPAL: Air pollution is impacting the lungs of majority of citizens in Bhopal, irrespective of the claims about air quality index (AQI) by authorities.The bad air can be gauged by the fact that Gandhi Medical College's Hamidia hospital has recorded a significant increase in hospitalisation due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).According to COPD IPD data at Hamidia hospital - one of the largest tertiary care hospitals in Bhopal. IPD hospitalisations for COPD were approximately 340 (in 2022) which increased by 21% or to 434 (in 2023).This year compared with 2022, the IPD numbers are 494 cases in 2024. With six weeks of the poorest period of air quality of the year yet to come, the number is expected to double in two years. Doctors suggest that the poor air quality and pollution is leading to asthma and bronchitis cases among the newborns and elderly in the city.The fog of despair is getting worse each year affecting our lungs in the state capital. Comparing the air quality to other metropolitan cities and suggesting Bhopal's air quality is superior is misleading.Gandhi Medical College's Hamidia hospital has recorded a significant increase in hospitalisation due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This information should encourage policy makers to address air pollution seriously and not wait for severe conditions like those experienced in Delhi.The data pertains specifically to COPD IPD at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals in Bhopal. IPD hospitalisations for COPD, were approximately 340 (in 2022) which increased by 21% or to 434 (in 2023). This year, compared with 2022, the IPD numbers are whopping 494 cases in 2024. With six weeks of poorest period of air quality of the year yet to come, the number of is expected to double in two years.Bhopal experiences worsened air quality during the peak winter months of October to February due to a combination of factors. These factors include stubble burning, reduced wind speed and colder temperatures, all contributing to air pollution which intern increases COPD distress, said GMC department of respiratory medicine, associate professor, Dr Vikas Mishra.Dr Mishra explains how poor air quality is negatively impacting people's health in two distinct ways. The most severe impact is on people with existing respiratory illnesses. ""In short stable patients become unstable and need higher dose of medication and hospitalisation or both. Even in otherwise healthy people, poor air quality is causing viral infections to linger for longer periods of time,"" he added.World COPD Day is observed every year on the third Wednesday of November, which falls on Nov 20 this year. The 2024 theme, ""Know Your Lung Function,"" highlights the importance of spirometry testing for diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evaluating lung health.COPD is more common in low-resource settings, where exposure to risk factors like tobacco smoke and pollution is often not controlled. Most of the cases are owing to worsening air quality, said Dr Mishra. However, experts do also point out that Bhopal has a significant higher COPD rate owing continuing environmental and health impact of the MiC gas leak of 1984.","Gandhi Medical College's Hamidia hospital has recorded a significant increase in hospitalisation due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) This year compared with 2022, the IPD numbers are 494 cases in 2024.

'Decline in youth joblessness in Punjab' riding on gig economy?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/decline-in-youth-joblessness-in-punjab-riding-on-gig-economy/articleshow/115470397.cms,"Pb sees rise in secondary sector hiring, says survey

MIXED TRENDS IN HARYANA, HP

CHANDIGARH: The job scenario in Punjab is looking up, with a notable decline in the unemployment rate, particularly among the educated younger age group, according to the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). However, the economists attribute it largely to the gig economy where individuals work as independent contractors or freelancers in temporary or part-time roles rather than as full-time employees.Despite this, unemployment remains a significant challenge for the Bhagwant Mann govt, especially among the educated youth. The govt faces mounting pressure to create sustainable job opportunities within the state.The unemployment rate (UR) in urban areas for the 15-29 years age group dropped to 12.2% in the July-Sep quarter, compared to 20.5% in the same period in 2023. In this year's April-June quarter, the joblessness rate stood at 16.2%, showing consistent improvement from 17.4% in Jan-March 2024.Among females, the unemployment rate declined from 21.8% in April-June to 18.5% in July-Sep. Similarly, for males, it fell from 14.7% to 10.7% during the same period. For the workforce aged 15 years and above, the overall unemployment rate dropped to 4.9%, down from 6.7% in the April-June quarter. The worker population ratio (WPR), which measures the percentage of employed people, showed mixed trends.In urban areas among the 15-29 age group, the WPR increased from 36.9% in April-June to 38.5% in July-Sep. However, the WPR declined slightly among females from 15.7% in April-June to 14.8%, while in males, it rose from 56.1% to 59.3%.The labour force participation rate (LFPR)-the percentage of people in the labour force who are working, seeking, or available for work-stood at 43.8% for those aged 15 years and above in urban areas during July-Sep, surpassing the national average of 41.6%. Among females, the LFPR was 18.2%, while among males, it was significantly higher at 66.4%.A sectoral analysis highlighted changes in employment patterns. The proportion of workers aged 15 years and above in agriculture rose slightly from 3.45% to 3.63%. Employment in the secondary sector, which includes manufacturing, construction, and utilities, increased from 35.42% to 37.35%. Conversely, the share of workers in the tertiary sector, encompassing services, trade, and transport, fell from 61.14% to 58.61%.Punjab-based economist Prof Ranjit Singh Ghuman attributed the rise in employment largely to increased workforce engagement in the gig economy. He cautioned that this model is neither sustainable nor a viable long-term solution to address unemployment in the state.Prof Aswini Kumar Nanda from the department of economics at the Central University of Jammu, who was with Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), Chandigarh, earlier and has worked in Punjab extensively, also attributed the rise in the employment rate to a significant influx of the workforce in the unorganised sector.In contrast to Punjab, neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh showed mixed trends. Haryana's unemployment rate for the 15 years and above age group rose from 4.7% to 5%, while Himachal Pradesh saw a slight decline from 9.1% to 8.7% in the same period. For the younger educated population, Haryana experienced an increase in unemployment from 11.2% to 11.7%, whereas Himachal Pradesh saw a sharp decline from 19% to 15.7%.","The unemployment rate in urban areas for the 15-29 years age group dropped to 12.2% in the July-Sep quarter.

(AP)

US President-elect Donald Trump has named Linda McMahon as the next education secretary. McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, will head the department of education, a federal agency Trump has previously suggested eliminating.“For the past four years, as the Chair of the Board at the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), Linda has been a fierce advocate for Parents’ Rights , working hard at both AFPI and America First Works (AFW) to achieve Universal School Choice in 12 States, giving children the opportunity to receive an excellent Education, regardless of zip code or income,” Trump said in a statement. He added that McMahon will fight ""tirelessly"" to expand universal school choice across the country.McMahon has a diverse background spanning business and politics. She and her husband Vince McMahon built World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), a company that grew to dominate the professional wrestling industry. Vince's father was also a wrestling promoter, and the McMahons followed in his footsteps.Trump and McMahon have previously worked together. When Trump was the host of the reality TV show *The Apprentice*, he participated in a 2007 WrestleMania event at WWE. The storyline included a scripted feud between Trump and Vince McMahon, culminating in Trump shaving Vince’s head in the wrestling ring.McMahon eventually moved into politics, stepping down from her role as WWE’s chief executive to pursue public office. She ran twice for a US Senate seat in Connecticut, losing in 2010 to Richard Blumenthal and in 2012 to Chris Murphy.Education was an early interest for McMahon. She served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009 and shared that she had initially planned to become a teacher before her career took a different direction after getting married.McMahon also served in Trump’s first administration as the head of the Small Business Administration (SBA), which provides loans and disaster relief to businesses and ensures compliance with government contracting laws. Trump praised her performance when she left the role in 2019, saying, “The fact is, I've known her for a long time. I knew she was good, but I didn't know she was that good.""After leaving the SBA, McMahon stayed connected to Trump. She chaired America First Action, a super PAC supporting Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign. Although Trump lost to Joe Biden, McMahon helped establish the America First Policy Institute to continue advocating for Trump’s policies.","Linda McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, will head the department of education.

NEW DELHI: Delhiites continued to breathe extremely poisonous air on Tuesday as the city's AQI remained in the 'severe-plus' category for the second day running.Almost all areas in the capital remained well within 'severe' levels through the day and experts said there was little hope of a marked improvement in air quality over the next few days.Read more: Delhi Air Pollution Live Updates: Deadly & toxic air turns city into gas chamber Delhi's average AQI on Tuesday was 460 on a scale of 0 to 500, just a shade better than the previous day's reading of 494, which was the city's second-worst air day on record. The thick shroud of smog seen over the city on Monday eased due to the dense fog layer moving east towards west UP, but a toxic haze persisted at most places.The capital's air remained the dirtiest in NCR as neighbouring cities were slightly better. Greater Noida had an AQI of 372 (very poor), Noida 370 (very poor), Gurgaon 402 (severe), Faridabad 320 (very poor) and Ghaziabad 434 (severe).

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Safdarjung saw a minimum visibility of 600m while Palam saw 1000m on Tuesday.“City saw north-westerly and westerly winds up to 6-8kmph on Tuesday. On Monday, the dense fog layer entered the city from Punjab and Haryana, which made dispersion difficult. The fog has shifted though the city still saw shallow fog and mist, so there is no significant improvement in AQI for now.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
