Ravindra, Chargé d'Affaires & DPR of India.India reiterated its call for time-bound negotiations to reform the UNSC, criticising the manipulation of council mechanisms by major powers as detrimental to the multilateral spirit. The ambassdor highlighted the importance of adapting the UNSC to contemporary realities, noting that the current global multipolarity is here to stay.""The primary reason the multilateral system has failed to deliver is that it is still stuck in a 1945 vintage binary outlook reflected clearly in the composition of this Security Council.

Ravindra urged for a renewed commitment to timely discussions on reforming the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), emphasizing the importance of adhering to a set timeline for these negotiations while criticizing the actions of certain powerful nations or groups that undermine the process.""Let us recommit to time-bound negotiations on UNSC reforms... Sabotaging of negotiating processes and mechanisms by big countries or groups in the narrow interest of their own positions is detrimental to the multilateral spirit and must be called out wherever necessary,"" he said.The Indian Ambassador addressed the UNSC during an Open Debate on ""Multilateral cooperation in the interest of a more just, democratic and sustainable world order.""",India at the UNSC meeting on Wednesday pointed out the UN's shortcomings in addressing complex global issues.

OBC quota controversy

Disability claims under cloud

Curious case of different names

MBBS seat in nomadic tribe-3 quota

Puja Khedkar's parents on run

NEW DELHI: An official car with VIP number plate , quarter and a seperate cabin with adequate staff — It all started when Puja Khedkar , a trainee IAS officer , sought special treatment from the collector's office that are not allowed for a probation officer. What started as a regular transfer case after complaints of alleged misuse of power , led to several questions regarding her disability certificate, selection criteria, etc.In a big step, the government on Tuesday put Khedkar's training in Maharashtra on hold and asked her to report back to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration by July 23.Here's how the controversy around trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar unfolded over the past few days.Pooja Khedkar came to the limelight after she was transferred by the Maharashtra government from Pune to Washim following complaints of alleged misuse of power.Amid this, she also used her private Audi car with a red-blue beacon light and VIP number plate. A 'Maharashtra government' board was also installed on her private car. The video, which went viral on social media, captured Khedkar arriving at the Pune Zilla Parishad office in the luxury vehicle with the beacon light flashing.As the viral went viral, the 2023 batch probationary officer was transferred from Pune collector's office to Washim.Officials said she was shifted based on the collector's report that said Khedkar ""sought special privileges, which were not allowed to an IAS probationary officer"".Troubles mounted for Khedkar after Maharashtra OBC welfare minister Atul Save announced a suo motu investigation to scrutinise the claims of Puja Khedkar that she belonged to the OBC non-creamy layer.Khedkar had declared herself as belonging to the OBC non-creamy layer to appear in the UPSC examinations.Save told TOI, ""The social justice department will take cognisance of the matter and conduct a thorough inquiry to ascertain how she obtained the non-creamy layer certificate.""The decision comes in the light of the details of her father Dilip Khedkar's recent Lok Sabha poll affidavit filed as a candidate from Ahmednagar seat which showed assets worth Rs 40 crore. The annual family income threshold for seeking reservation under the OBC non-creamy layer category is set at Rs 8 lakh.Khedkar allegedly submitted fake disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to clear the civil services exam. Reports indicated that she also submitted a mental illness certificate.In April 2022, she was asked to report to Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for verification of her disability certificate but did not comply, citing a Covid-19 infection.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the 'Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)' category.Puja Khedkar, who by now was in the eye of the storm for alleged misuse of power and manipulating disability and OBC quotas, found herself in deeper trouble as discrepancy was found on her part wherein she allegedly used two different names - Khedkar Puja Deeliprao and Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar during civil services exams.In 2019, in her civil services prelims exam, the IAS trainee had registered herself as Khedkar Puja Deeliprao, and her appointment in SAI was also in the same name with Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) (LV) - OBC.However, in her 2022 service allocation by Union Public Services Commission (UPSC), where she was selected for IAS, she went by the name Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar under the PwBD-multiple disabilities (MD) category.In a Central Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai bench, order dated Feb 23, 2023, her name as the applicant was mentioned as Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar.Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar had in August 2022 simultaneously applied for disability certificates for locomotor disability from District Civil Hospital, Aundh, and Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, Pimpri, both in Pune, report Nisha Nambiar & Swati Shinde Gole.Embroiled in a controversy over the legitimacy of her certificates, Khedkar was alleged to have secured MBBS admission to Pune’s Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital in 2007 under the reserved nomadic tribe-3 category furnishing a non-creamy layer OBC certificate.Khedkar gained admission through the Association of Management of Unaided Private Medical and Dental Colleges of Maharashtra (AMUPMDC) entrance test, scoring 146 out of 200, said college director Arvind Bhore said Saturday. AMUPMDC no longer exists after NEET’s introduction.Amid heightened media scrutiny of Puja Khedkar, her parents are on the run following the filing of an FIR against them for allegedly threatening a farmer.Separate teams of Pune police visited the Baner bungalow of Puja’s mother, Manorama Khedkar, on Sunday, but received no response despite repeated attempts to make contact.The case was filed on Friday night after a video surfaced showing Manorama Khedkar, accompanied by private bouncers, brandishing a pistol on June 5, last year, during an argument with farmers over a land ownership dispute.On Saturday, police recorded statements from witnesses in Dhadawali and conducted a spot panchnama.At 7 am on Sunday, officials from the Paud police and the Rural police’s local crime branch arrived at Manorama’s bungalow.",Pooja Khedkar came to the limelight after she was transferred by the Maharashtra government from Pune to Washim following complaints of alleged misuse of power. She also used her private Audi car with a red-blue beacon light and VIP number plate. A 'Mahar Maharashtra government' board was also installed on her private car.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111789537,imgsize-43102,width-400,resizemode-4/111789537.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday put Puja Khedkar 's IAS training on hold amid a fake certificate probe and directed her to return to the academy in Mussoorie at the earliest.Khedkar has also been relieved from the District Training Programme of the Maharashtra government.""LBSNAA, Mussoorie has decided to keep your District Training Program on hold and immediately recall you for further necessary action...,"" the letter from Nitin Gadre, additional chief secretary (P) read.Puja Khedkar has been in the eye of the storm for alleged misuse of power and manipulating disability and OBC quotas.Khedkar allegedly submitted fake disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to clear the civil services exam. Reports indicate she also submitted a mental illness certificate.In April 2022, she was asked to report to Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) for verification of her disability certificate but did not comply, citing a Covid-19 infection.Khedkar is said to have recurrently failed to appear for mandatory medical tests to confirm her disability, despite having qualified for IAS in the 'Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD)' category.The action comes after the central government established a single-member committee to examine the claims and details surrounding Khedkar's candidature.The ministry of personnel on July 13 had announced that the committee, chaired by a senior officer of the rank of Additional Secretary, would submit its report in two weeks.Sources in the government told TOI that the panel of DoPT additional secretary Manoj Dwivedi will, over the next two weeks, probe how she obtained the documents establishing her disability and OBC status, and whether proper vetting was carried out by the issuing authority.The panel will, in consultation with experts from AIIMS Delhi, also examine if the visual and mental disability claimed by her meets the benchmarks for employment in the government.Puja Khedkar is also reportedly involved in another discrepancy where in she used two different names - Khedkar Puja Deeliprao and Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar.In 2019, in her civil services prelims exam, the IAS trainee had registered herself as Khedkar Puja Deeliprao, and her appointment in SAI was also in the same name with Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) (LV) - OBC.However, in her 2022 service allocation by Union Public Services Commission (UPSC), where she was selected for IAS, she went by the name Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar under the PwBD-multiple disabilities (MD) category.In a Central Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai bench, order dated Feb 23, 2023, her name as the applicant was mentioned as Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar. Probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar had in August 2022 simultaneously applied for disability certificates for locomotor disability from District Civil Hospital, Aundh, and Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, Pimpri, both in Pune, report Nisha Nambiar & Swati Shinde Gole.She did so despite having secured disability certificates for low vision in 2018 and for mental depression and low vision in 2021 from the Ahmednagar district hospital.The District Civil Hospital at Aundh had rejected her application because of ""double submission"", while Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH), Pimpri, granted a 7% locomotor disability certificate citing an old ACL tear.In her defence amid the ongoing probe, Puja Khedkar on Monday said the ""media trial"" to prove her guilty was wrong.""Everybody knows what is going on. So proving me guilty by media trial is wrong on everybody's part. The Indian Constitution is based on the fact that you are innocent till proven guilty"" she said.",Puja Khedkar has been in the eye of the storm for alleged misuse of power and manipulating disability and OBC quotas.

An ‘accident-in-waiting’: Kanchanjunga Express report cites multiple-level lapses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-accident-in-waiting-kanchanjunga-express-report-cites-multiple-level-lapses/articleshow/111793932.cms,"NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Commission of Railway Safety (CRS), in its provisional findings in the Kanchanjunga Express accident that claimed 10 lives, has pointed to wrong authority letters issued to loco pilots on how to negotiate defective signals and lapses at “multiple levels” in train operations following failure of automatic signals.In its report to the Railway Board, CRS grimly noted that this was an “accident-in-waiting”, citing how improper authority letters were issued at the zonal level to loco pilots and that too without adequate information.The report, although provisional, has virtually exonerated the goods train loco pilot Amit Kumar, who was faulted by railway authorities in the immediate wake of the mishap while pointing a finger at ambiguity in rules to be followed in cases of failure of automatic signals, the Rangapani station master and senior authorities in Katihar division.The loco pilot was among those killed in the accident on June 17 in West Bengal's Darjeeling district.The CRS said the ‘paper authority’ issued to loco pilots of trains operating between Rangapani and Chatterhat on that day when automatic signals had failed did not mention the speed limit that drivers were supposed to follow while crossing defective signals. Also, the loco pilot and the train manager were not provided with walkie-talkies which could have ensured better communication.On the role of the loco pilot of the goods train that collided with Kanchanjungha Express, the report said the authority letter (T/A 912) was given to him to pass all the mentioned defective signals without any caution order. “This created an impression in the mind of the loco pilot that all defective signals can be passed at the maximum permissible speed of the section,” it said.The maximum speed of the section was 110 kmph. The goods train was moving at 78 kmph and when the loco pilot applied brakes, he couldn’t decelerate below 40 kmph and ended up rear-ending Kanchanjunga Express, which had stopped.Immediately after the mishap, Railway Board chairperson Jaya Verma Sinha had claimed that Kumar had disregarded signals and this led to the accident.The report pointed out that on the day of the accident, officials should have treated the signalling failure — reported at 5.50am — as a “major signal failure” and followed the ‘automatic block system (ABS)’. In this system, only one train is allowed to stay between two stations. No other train is supposed to enter the stretch until the preceding one has reached the next station.In this case, not declaring ABS meant the station master at Rangapani allowed the goods train to enter the section without confirming with the Chatterhat station master whether Kanchanjungha Express had crossed. The Rangapani station master also issued the wrong authority letter (T/A 912, which does not have any speed restrictions, instead of T/B 912, which limits speed to 25kmph) to loco pilots of the two trains involved in the accident, as well as five other trains preceding them.The railway safety regulator found that besides these two trains, five other trains had entered the section since the signals turned defective on that day, each following different speeds while passing defective signals.“It is evident that the understanding of loco pilots regarding action to be taken when T/A 912 is issued is not clear to them. Some loco pilots have followed the 15kmph rule while most loco pilots did not follow this rule. The absence of proper authority and that too without adequate information created misinterpretation and misunderstanding about the speed to be followed,” the report said.It also mentioned that no caution order was issued to the loco pilots by the station master.As per the findings, only Kanchanjungha Express followed the norm of moving at a maximum speed of 15kmph and stopping for one minute at each defective signal while the remaining six trains, including the goods train, didn’t follow this norm.The report also flagged that there was “inadequate counselling of loco pilots and station masters” about train operation in automatic signalling territory. It said “ad hocism” was prevalent at the divisional level in issuing the authorities and instructions, and station masters were adopting different procedures.The CRS said in case of multiple signal failures , there were three options left with the rail administration, but they followed none.On the role of others, the report said the control office at the divisional level must be manned by one senior section engineer, one junior engineer and one helper round-the-clock in an eight-hour shift. However, on the night of June 16, the signalling control office was manned by a technician.“It is not possible to manage such a major signalling failure by a staff of technician level. The response of higher officials of the signalling department at the divisional level posted in Katihar has been found lacklustre as despite being informed about this serious failure, none of them went to the control office to manage and coordinate with other departments for timely attention of signalling failures,” it said.","Commission of Railway Safety (CRS) has pointed to wrong authority letters issued to loco pilots on how to negotiate defective signals.

'Fake news will fail': Railway minister Vaishnaw counters Rahul Gandhi's claims on 'poor' condition of loco pilots

Learn about Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's response to Rahul Gandhi's meeting with loco pilots, highlighting improvements in working conditions and recruitment efforts in the railway sector.

NEW DELHI: Raising concern over a large number of signalling failures in “automatic signalling” sections, the Commission of Railway Safety (CRS) has recommended the national transporter to “improve reliability” of the system. Railway Board officials said on Tuesday that a comprehensive action plan is being developed to enhance the reliability and resilience of signalling equipment across the country.The CRS, in its report on the Kanchanjungha Express accident, said that there were 275 failures in the automatic signalling section of just Katihar Division since its commissioning in Jan 2023 to June 20, 2024. It said a large number of signaling failures in the automatic signalling section “is defeating the very purpose of mobility enhancement and causing safety concerns”.Referring to the 208 instances of signal passing at danger (SPAD) between April 2019 and March 2024, out of which 12 cases resulted in collision, the safety regulator said this highlights limitations of preventive measures taken by Zonal Railways (counselling of loco pilot, assistant loco pilots and drives). It has recommended expediting the roll out of anti-train collision system, Kavach.Meanwhile, the Railway Board has instructed all zones to standardise training programmes for loco pilots operating in automatic signalling areas. It has specified one-day intensive counselling sessions based on an automatic signalling system for loco pilots and their assistants every six months.It said the counselling focus should be on working procedures, especially in automatic signalling territories and relevant forms should be issued for abnormal operations with speed restrictions. The loco pilots will be shown animated videos which highlight common crew mistakes.",Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw addresses concerns raised by Congress regarding loco pilots' work conditions.

Newly developed farm technologies are meant for water management and precision agriculture that can reduce input costs of farmers so that their income can be multiplied.Addressing the foundation day function here on Tuesday, agriculture and rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appealed to ICAR to come out with a model farm showing how small and marginal land-holding farmers can be benefited from it through integrated farming, crop diversification and judicious use of resources.He emphasised that the priority of the government is not only to increase production and productivity, and reduce dependence on imports of crops such as pulses and oilseeds but also to address the concerns of small and marginal land-holding farmers who account for the majority (nearly 85%) of total farmers in the country.""Our farmers have very small sizes of land up to 1acre, 1.5 acre or 2 acres. We have to think about them and see how they can be benefited from practical utilization of research and innovation,"" said Chouhan.Underlining the need to reach the benefits of research to farmers through sincerely adopting 'lab to land' approach, the minister suggested the ICAR to send a batch of two scientists each to all 731 'Krishi Vigyan Kendra' (farm extension centres) across the country to study the problems of farmers and provide solutions to end their woes.Chouhan also asked the scientists to set a target of four years and work to achieve it so that they can show results on the ground when they assemble on the occasion of the 100th foundation day of the ICAR in 2028.He said, "" Prime Minister Modi has resolved to make India developed by 2047, in which agriculture and allied sectors (livestock, dairy and fisheries) will play an important role.""Chouhan, former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, also cited example of his home state, saying it was once considered 'BIMARU' state (acronym coined for states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh due to their low economic growth) but agricultural development has taken it out from that group.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi may release 100 new seed varieties of different crops and 100 farm technologies on completion of the first 100 days of his third term in September.

LUCKNOW: With work progressing according to the timeline even during the monsoon, the 594-km Ganga Expressway is set to be opened to the public by Dec 31.The ambitious project of the Yogi Adityanath government will connect the Bijauli locality in Meerut with Judapur Dandu in Prayagraj. The addition of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway will thus provide a seamless drive between Delhi and Prayagraj in approximately seven hours.The state government has asked the agencies executing the project to expedite the construction of the two major bridges — a 960-metre-long bridge between Meerut and Badaun (over the Ganga) and a 720-metre-long bridge between Badaun and Hardoi (over the Ramganga).The entire stretch of the six-lane expressway will comprise 14 major bridges, 7 railway overbridges, 32 flyovers, and a 3.5-km-long airstrip for the emergency landing of fighter planes in the Jalalabad area of Shahjahanpur district.The Expressways Industrial Authority ( UPEIDA ) has asked officials to ensure that all the essential structures and the high-speed corridor are ready before the deadline (Dec 31) so that it can help facilitate the movement of motor vehicles to Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh in January next year. Being constructed with a budget of Rs 36,230 crore, the Ganga Expressway will provide accessibility and connectivity to 12 districts.A total of 7,453 hectares of land spanning over 518 villages has been aggregated for the project.Having a right-of-way width of 120 meters, the expressway will have six lanes with a scope to add two more lanes in the future as per future need.While the speed limit will be fixed once the stretch is ready, UPEIDA officials said that the agencies executing the work have been asked to design the expressway to facilitate the commute of vehicle owners at the speed of 120 km per hour.Divided into four segments, the Meerut-Badaun section (129.70 km) is being built by IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited, while the remaining three segments Badaun-Hardoi (151.70 km), Hardoi-Unnao (155.70 km), and Unnao-Prayagraj (156.85 km) are being constructed by Adani Infrastructure.Sharing more details, a senior officer from the authority said that 82% of the earthwork has been done on the main carriageway. Similarly, the sub-base on 58% of the carriageway is complete, while bituminous macadam has been rolled out over 50% of the 596-km-long stretch. Out of the 1,481 structures, the two construction agencies have already commissioned 1,215 structures.While two main toll plazas will be constructed over the carriageway in Meerut and Prayagraj, 15 more plazas will come up on the entry and exit ramps. Nine facilities will also be set up on the route to cater to the commuters.“The expressway will bring down the commute time between west and east Uttar Pradesh,” said the officer.","The ambitious project of the Yogi Adityanath government will connect the Bijauli locality in Meerut with Judapur Dandu in Prayagraj.

Kanchanjunga Express accident was 'waiting to happen': Railway safety report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kanchanjunga-express-accident-was-waiting-to-happen-railway-safety-report/articleshow/111776833.cms,"Kanchanjunga Express accident (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) has said that the Kanchanjunga Express accident, which claimed ten lives including the loco pilot of the goods train was ""waiting to happen"" because of multiple lapses in train operations management in automatic signal zones and ""inadequate counselling"" of loco pilots and station masters.The CRS, in its report, recommended the immediate implementation of the Automatic Train-protection system (KAVACH) to avoid future occurrences.Following an investigation, the CRS identified that a ""wrong paper authority"" or T/A 912 to cross defective signals had been issued to the loco pilot of the goods train involved in the crash. The paper authority failed to specify the speed the goods train should adhere to while crossing the defective signal.""Due to improper authority and that too without adequate information, such an incident was an 'accident-in-waiting,'"" the CRS report stated, highlighting the lapses in rail administration.Besides the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train, five other trains had entered the section after the signals became defective until the accident occurred. The CRS noted that despite issuing the same authority, different speed patterns were followed by the loco pilots, with only the Kanchanjunga Express adhering to the norm of moving at a maximum speed of 15 kmph and stopping for one minute at each defective signal.""This shows that 'action to be taken when T/A 912 is issued to them is not clear. Some of the loco pilots have followed the 15 kmph rule while most of the loco pilots did not follow this rule. The absence of proper authority and that too without adequate information created misinterpretation and misunderstanding about the speed to be followed,'"" the report said.The CRS emphasized the inadequate counselling of loco pilots and station masters regarding train operation in automatic signalling territory, creating misinterpretations and misunderstandings of rules. The incident was classified under the ""Error in Train Working"" category.“The large number of signalling failures in automatic signalling territory is a cause of concern and should be taken up with those concerned to improve the reliability of the system,” the CRS report noted. The report cited 208 cases of Signal Passing at Danger (red signal overshooting) from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2024, including 12 cases resulting in collisions, underscoring the limitations of preventive measures taken by zonal railways such as loco pilot counselling, safety drives, etc.“This underscores the need for implementation of the Automatic Train-protection system (KAVACH) on top priority. Use of non-signalling-based systems such as Artificial intelligence-based detection of the RED aspect of the signal and providing an early warning to the loco pilot/GPS-based anti-collision systems shall be explored for provision in locomotive cabs across Indian Railways in non-ATP (automatic train protection) territory,” the report recommended.The investigation also revealed a shortage of walkie-talkies in the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) Zone, where the accident occurred, preventing the goods train crew from being issued this critical safety equipment.In the event of multiple signal failures, the CRS highlighted three potential courses of action for the rail administration, none of which were fully followed in this incident. The first option was for drivers to follow the general rule of stopping the train for one minute at the defective signal and proceeding with great caution until the next stop signal. The second option was issuing a T/A 912 form with a caution order specifying the speed to be maintained, which was not done in this case. The third option was treating the scenario as a ""major signal failure"" and using the Automatic Block System, whereby only one train is allowed between two stations until the preceding train clears the next station.The CRS pointed out that the control office at the divisional level should be staffed round-the-clock by one Senior Section Engineer, one Junior Engineer, and one helper in an 8-hour shift. However, on the night of June 16 and June 17, the signalling control office was manned only by a technician.“It is not possible to manage such a major signalling failure by a staff of technician level. The response of higher officials of the signalling department at the divisional level posted at Katihar has been found lackluster as despite being informed about this serious failure, none of them went to the control office to manage and coordinate with other departments for timely attention of signalling failures,"" the report said.Since the introduction of automatic signalling in January 2023, the CRS stressed the necessity of implementing all applicable rules at the field level. The prevalent misinterpretation of rules indicated the lack of a system of checks and balances at the headquarters level.","The Kanchanjunga Express accident claimed ten lives including the loco pilot of the goods train.

But her AMUPMDC score was higher than the state CET. She had provided a non-creamy layer certificate of the NT-3 category of the Vanjari community at the time of admission. We checked all the documents at the time of submission and found them to be authentic govt records,” Bhore said.Khedkar’s non-creamy layer certificate was issued by Pathardi sub-divisional office in Ahmednagar in 2007. Her caste and validity certificates were also issued by the same office, according to college records. Bhore mentioned she did not submit any disability certificate at the time of admission.When TOI contacted Khedkar, her cellphone was switched off.

"Who is JD Vance, Donald Trump's pick for vice president?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jd-vance-donald-trumps-pick-for-vice-president/articleshow/111763669.cms,"The rise of JD Vance

Vance's path to the senate

From never-Trumper to fierce ally

Prominent figure in the conservative movement

Vance seen as key asset for Trump campaign

Former US President Donald Trump selected senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, opting for a former critic who has since become a dedicated supporter. Vance, the first millennial to be part of a major-party ticket, joins at a time when there are significant worries about the advanced age of America's political leaders.Trump announced his decision on his Truth Social network, saying, ""After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio,"" as the Republican National Convention commenced in Milwaukee.Vance, 39, gained national recognition with the release of his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in 2016. He was elected to the Senate in 2022 and has emerged as one of the most ardent supporters of the former president's ""Make America Great Again"" agenda, especially in the areas of trade, foreign policy, and immigration.JD Vance, a native of Middletown, Ohio, has had a diverse career path. After serving in the Marines and completing a tour of duty in Iraq, he pursued higher education, obtaining degrees from Ohio State University and Yale Law School. Vance also gained experience in the business world, working as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.Vance rose to prominence with the publication of his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in 2016, coinciding with Donald Trump's initial presidential campaign. The book's success established Vance as an insightful commentator on the factors contributing to Trump's appeal among working-class, rural white voters in middle America, a demographic that played a significant role in Trump's electoral victory.""Hillbilly Elegy"" not only brought Vance into the public eye but also connected him with the Trump family. Donald Trump Jr, an admirer of the book, was already familiar with Vance when he embarked on his political career. The two developed a friendship that has endured over time.Following Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election, JD Vance returned to Ohio, his home state, and established an anti-opioid charity. Vance also began delivering speeches at various events, including Republican Lincoln Day dinners, where his personal narrative resonated with audiences.These speaking engagements provided Vance with a platform to share his ideas for improving the nation, and they helped pave the way for his entry into the political arena in 2021, according to a report from Reuters. When Republican senator Rob Portman announced his retirement, Vance seized the opportunity to run for the vacant Senate seat.With the endorsement of former President Trump, Vance emerged victorious from a highly competitive Republican primary. He then went on to win the general election, securing his position as a US senator from Ohio.Vance, a Republican who initially opposed Donald Trump's candidacy in 2016, had a change of heart by 2021. Despite previously labeling Trump as ""dangerous"" and ""unfit"" for office, Vance later praised the former president's achievements during his tenure.Vance, married to Indian-American lawyer Usha Chilukuri Vance, with whom he shares three children, had also denounced Trump's racist language, even suggesting he could be ""America's Hitler."" However, when the two met in 2021, they both minimised Vance's earlier critical remarks.Upon his election to office, Vance emerged as a staunch supporter of Trump on Capitol Hill, consistently defending the former president's actions and policies without hesitation.Kevin Roberts, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, praised JD Vance as a prominent figure in the conservative movement, particularly regarding his stances on non-interventionist foreign policy, free market principles, and ""American culture writ large.""However, Democrats label Vance as an extremist due to his controversial positions, which he has occasionally modified. For example, during his Senate campaign, Vance expressed support for a nationwide 15-week abortion ban but later softened his stance after Ohio voters decisively supported a 2023 abortion rights amendment.Regarding the 2020 election, Vance said that if he had been vice president, he would not have immediately certified the results and that Trump had ""a very legitimate grievance.""He has set conditions for accepting the results of the 2024 election that are similar to Trump's, despite numerous government and independent investigations finding no evidence of election fraud that could have altered the outcome of Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.In the Senate, Vance occasionally embraces bipartisanship. He co-sponsored a railway safety bill with Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown following a fiery train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Additionally, he has sponsored legislation to extend and increase funding for Great Lakes restoration and supported bipartisan initiatives to support workers and families.JD Vance, a potential vice presidential candidate, possesses qualities that could significantly benefit the Republican ticket, according to individuals knowledgeable about the selection process. His strengths include exceptional debating abilities, a talent for raising campaign funds, and the capacity to effectively communicate Trump's agenda.In the opinion of Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, a prominent conservative activist organisation, Vance has the capability to persuasively express the America First perspective. Kirk suggests that Vance's presence on the ticket could aid Trump in securing victory in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, which narrowly eluded him in the 2020 election. These states share similar values, demographics, and economic characteristics with Ohio, making Vance a potentially valuable asset in these crucial battlegrounds.","JD Vance, 39, gained national recognition with the release of his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" in 2016.

The initial focus will be on low-alcohol drinks like beer, wine, and liqueurs, according to industry executives familiar with the developments, as reported by the Economic Times.Dinker Vashisht, vice-president of corporate affairs at Swiggy, mentioned in the report, ""Online models ensure end-to-end transaction records, age verification and adhere to limits.Further, online tech stacks synchronise with regulatory and excise requirements, ensuring adherence to timings, dry days and zonal delivery guardrails.""During the Covid-19 lockdowns, deliveries were temporarily allowed in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Assam with restrictions. However, legitimate deliveries of alcobev are not currently permitted in these states, although a few local online platforms continue to deliver, particularly in Maharashtra.The state authorities are seeking input on the advantages and disadvantages of online delivery from ecommerce platforms and spirits manufacturers. ""This is to cater to a growing expat population especially in larger cities, changing profiles of consumers who perceive moderate alcohol-content spirits as recreational drinking along with meals, and women and senior citizens who have flagged buying from traditional liquor vends and shop-front experiences as unpleasant,"" the report said citing an official. Currently, home delivery of alcohol is permitted in Odisha and West Bengal.Rahul Singh, chief executive of pub chain The Beer Cafe, said, ""By enabling online home deliveries of liquor, states can enhance consumer convenience, drive economic growth, and align with global trends while ensuring responsible and regulated alcohol distribution."" An unnamed executive cited earlier added, ""Apprehensions about unchecked selling online too have been found to be unwarranted since checks include mandatory eKYC, upper caps on purchases, OTP verifications between stores, delivery executives and customers.""Singh further emphasised, ""Delivery services can implement strict age verification and compliance measures, potentially offering more cont rolled and regulated sales than traditional retail outlets. This can help prevent underage drinking and ensure responsible consumption.""","New Delhi, Karnataka, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Kerala are exploring pilot projects.

ByAs I look back on my journey that brought me to where I am today, I realise how much I have benefitted from the values I was raised with – like commitment, integrity, being respectful, taking responsibility. All these were instilled in me by my parents who worked hard to provide us with a good all-round education, not just a formal one.Here are some core principles that have served as my North Star.It is important to have a deep enthusiasm and drive for everything you do, and rest assured that the results will follow. I have always been passionate about leading by example to create a positive impact on the environment & my community through everything I do, both professionally and personally.Always have belief in your own worth, capabilities & potential. It allows you to trust in your abilities, make decisions with conviction, have the resilience to overcome challenges and helps you to stay motivated and take action towards your aspirations. I have encountered many nay-sayers and this attribute has always helped me overcome. When my organisation gave me an opportunity to lead teams in multiple geographies even though I had no prior experience, I had a belief in myself to take on this new challenge, stretch my capabilities and deliver.As a woman, there are multiple pulls between competing priorities with family and work. It is important to separate what needs time and energy, what can be delegated, and importantly, to know when to ask for help. It would have been a lot more difficult for me to get back to work, leaving behind my 4-monthold son, if I did not trust the support system at home and delegate my responsibilities.Developing a supportive network of relationships in your personal and professional lives is key to building a sustainable career. With trusted allies at work and a supportive family, I have always been able to navigate through difficult situations.It is so important to express appreciation to people who have provided opportunities and helped in your development . Being candid and honest also helps.From being an individual contributor to leading teams across geographies, I think about my early career at GE and the 15 years at my current organisation 3M and can clearly see the trajectory of my development in terms of my desire to protect my team, my peers, my community and foster the passion to work for the environment by helping to develop safe and compliant products. It has all been possible by my belief in self, gratitude, wonderful relationships, focus, and passion.","Rachita Dinesh shares some of the core principles that have served as her North Star.

This rally was fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, which could boost the economy and corporate profits. The positive sentiment was further supported by strong earnings reports from major companies like Bank of America and UnitedHealth Group.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 742.76 points, or 1.85%, to 40,954.48, the S&P 500 gained 35.98 points, or 0.64%, at 5,667.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.77 points, or 0.2%, at 18,509.34.Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, industrials enjoyed the largest percentage gains, while technology and communication services were the only two sectors to end in negative territory.Economically sensitive small caps extended their rally. The Russell 2000 scored a fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000. The index gained 3.5%, touching its highest level since January 2022.Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's comments about the possibility of lowering interest rates sooner if the job market cools ""too much"" added to the optimism on Wall Street. Analysts believe that the current market environment assumes a perfect scenario where the Fed cuts rates while inflation slows down without pushing the economy into a recession. Additionally, rising expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the 2024 US presidential election, which could lead to tax cuts and deregulation, further contributed to the bullish sentiment.In contrast to the US market, European bourses experienced declines, with German investor confidence falling for the first time in a year. The International Monetary Fund maintained its global growth forecast for this year at 3.2% but trimmed its projections for the United States and Japan while warning of ongoing inflation risks and trade tensions.Gold prices also reached a new record, jumping 1.9% to $2,450.07 per ounce, driven by shifting expectations regarding the Fed's monetary policy.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.
