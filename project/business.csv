Special focus on Bihar

'Kursi Bachao Budget'

NEW DELHI: Union Budget 2024 on Tuesday opened floodgates of goodies for ""ally"" states Andhra Pradesh and Bihar - reflecting the political compulsion of Modi 3.0 government which is dependent on the support of Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar for its survival.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not have accepted the demand for ""special category status"" for the two states, but his finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several schemes and incentives to keep the two leaders in good humour.From tourism and industry push in Bihar to capital needs of Andhra Pradesh, Sitharaman's Budget had a lot for the two states.Chandrababu Naidu's TDP with 16 members in Lok Sabha and Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) with 12 members play a crucial role in keeping the NDA 3.0 government afloat after the BJP could manage only 240 seats, 32 short of majority, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech announced special financial support of Rs 15,000 crore for the new capital of Andhra Pradesh in the current financial year and also promised additional amounts in future.The Centre also committed itself to financing and early completion of the Polavaram Irrigation Project, calling it the lifeline for Andhra Pradesh and its farmers.The Budget also pushed for industrial development of the state as it promised funds for essential infrastructure such as water, power, railways and roads in Kopparthy node on the Vishakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor and Orvakal node on Hyderabad-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.Sitharaman also announced additional allocation towards capital investment for economic growth of the state and grants for backward regions of Rayalaseema, Prakasam and North Coastal Andhra, as stated in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.The other state to benefit hugely from Modi government's Budget largesse is Bihar. Sitharaman announced to provide additional allocation to support capital investments in the state and promised to expedite requests of Bihar government for external assistance from multilateral development banks.The Budget announced support for comprehensive development of Vishnupad Temple Corridor and Mahabodhi Temple Corridor, which have been modelled on the successful Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor, to transform them into world class pilgrim and tourist destinations.Sitharaman also promised Centre's support for development of road connectivity projects in the state at a cost of Rs 26,000 crore. The projects that found mention in the Budget included: Patna-Purnea Expressway, Buxar-Bhagalpur Expressway, Bodhgaya, Rajgir, Vaishali and Darbhanga spurs, and additional 2-lane bridge over river Ganga at Buxar.The Centre announced support of Rs 21,400 crore for setting up of a new 2400 MW power plant at Pirpainti and spoke of constructing new airports, medical colleges and sports infrastructure in the state.Andhra chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and his Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar were quick to thank Prime Minister Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.""On behalf of the people of Andhra Pradesh, I thank the Hon'ble Prime Minister, @narendramodi Ji and Hon'ble Union Finance Minister, @nsitharaman Ji, for recognising the needs of our State and focusing on a Capital, Polavaram, industrial nodes and development of backward areas in AP in the union budget of FY 24-25. This support from the Centre will go a long way towards rebuilding Andhra Pradesh. I congratulate you on the presentation of this progressive and confidence-boosting budget,"" Naidu said in a statement.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar claimed victory over Budget allocations for the state. ""I told them (NDA) to either give us a special status or a special package. As a follow-up, they have announced aid for a lot of things. We were demanding special status and a lot of people said that provision for special status has been done away with. So, instead of that, aid should be given for helping Bihar which has now started,"" Nitish Kumar said.With so much of focus on the two states, the opposition was quick to call Modi 3.0 first Budget as ""Kursi bachao Budget"". "" 'Kursi Bachao' Budget. Appease Allies: Hollow promises to them at the cost of other states. Appease Cronies: Benefits to AA with no relief for the common Indian. Copy and Paste: Congress manifesto and previous budgets,"" Rahul Gandhi posted on X.Congress alleged that several announcements in the Budget were copy-pasted from the party's 2024 manifesto. Senior P Chidambaram took a swipe at the government and said he is glad that finance minister Sitharaman has read the Congress 2024 manifesto after the Lok Sabha poll results.In a post on X, Chidambaram said, ""I am glad to know that the Hon'ble FM has read the Congress Manifesto LS 2024 after the election results. I am happy she has virtually adopted the Employment-linked incentive (ELI) outlined on page 30 of the Congress Manifesto.""""I am also happy that she has introduced the Apprenticeship scheme along with an allowance to every apprentice spelt out on page 11 of the Congress Manifesto. I wish the FM had copied some other ideas in the Congress Manifesto. I shall shortly list the missed opportunities,"" the former finance minister said.(With inputs from agencies)","Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) play a crucial role in keeping the NDA 3.0 government afloat.

""I can answer. I am the amicus.""The Chief Justice retorted, ""I have not appointed any amicus.""The advocate persisted, ""If you don't respect me, I will leave.""This was followed by a stern response from the Chief Justice.

I cannot allow lawyers to dictate proceedings in this court.""Nedumpara continued, ""I have witnessed it since 1979."" The Chief Justice then admonished him that he may have to issue a directive. ""I may be compelled to issue something that is not equitable. You will not interrupt any other lawyer,"" he said. The lawyer eventually departed. He returned to the court subsequently.This is not the first instance where Mathews Nedumpara has been reprimanded by the Chief Justice for his conduct in the courtroom.

If you desire to file an application, submit it via email. That is the rule in this court.""In its decision, the apex court said the 2024 NEET-UG exam will not be reconducted.

"Supreme Court: No NEET-UG retest, but 4 lakh candidates to lose 5 marks each",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-no-neet-ug-retest-but-4-lakh-candidates-to-lose-5-marks-each/articleshow/111969731.cms,"'Won't Allow You To Dictate': Ugly Scenes In SC As CJI Clashes With NEET Lawyer | Watch

Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected pleas for a retest for admissions to 1.08 lakh MBBS seats in govt and private medical colleges in the absence of evidence to establish that the exam paper leak in Hazaribag vitiated the results or breached the examination’s sanctity and integrity, a verdict that lifted the haze of uncertainty that had hung over NEET-UG while also ending the anxiety that had faced those likely to fetch the much-coveted seats in medical colleges across the country.However, 4.2 lakh students who had got 4 marks even after choosing a wrong option to an atomic theory question stand to lose 5 marks (4 for the question and 1 negative mark for answering it wrongly) as the SC accepted the IIT-Delhi expert committee’s report, which termed only one option as correct.This will entail a huge reshuffle of ranks. One of the toppers had secured 720 out of 720 despite picking the wrong option, which along with the right option was deemed correct by NTA due to an error in the previous year's NCERT physics book. Her score will now drop to 715, which will drag her rank several notches down and will be inadequate to get admission to the MBBS course in AIIMS-Delhi, her counsel said.After a four-day hearing, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra dictated the order in open court much after business hours and said, “At the present stage, there is an absence of material on record sufficient to lead to the conclusion that results of the examination stands vitiated or that there was a systemic breach in the sanctity of the examination.”The bench said a detailed judgment would follow in a few days and that it had dictated the operative portion of the decision keeping in mind the uncertainty in the minds of 23.33 lakh students, who had appeared in NEET-UG 2024. Counselling for admissions to MBBS courses is scheduled to commence on Wednesday.CJI Chandrachud, who dictated the order, said, “Adding to the absence of conclusive material on record at the present stage, the city-wise and centre-wise data placed on record by National Testing Agency (NTA) and a comparison of NEET-UG results for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 is not indicative of a systemic leak of question paper (this year), which would indicate destruction of the sanctity of examination.“In arriving at the ultimate conclusion, the court is guided by the ultimate test whether it is possible to segregate tainted students from those whose candidature does not suffer from any taint.”The court's determination also marked validation of the NTA and the Centre, which maintained that the leak in Hazaribag was a localised affair and did not compromise the integrity of the exam and, therefore, NEET-UG need not be scrapped.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and CBI additional director Krishna informed the court that so far, the probe had found that the impact of question paper leak was limited to Hazaribag and Patna and that only 155 candidates benefited from it, even though only two of them secured more than 570 marks. The bench took note of Mehta’s argument that candidature of the 155 candidates had been cancelled and they may get debarred from appearing in NEET-UG in future. The SG also said admission of any candidate, if later found to have indulged in wrongdoing or taken advantage of question paper leak, would be cancelled as and when it was detected.The bench said, “If investigation reveals involvement of an increased number of beneficiaries (of question paper leak), then action shall be pursued against those students who are found involved in wrongdoing at any stage, notwithstanding the completion of the counselling process. No student who has engaged in acts of fraud and is a beneficiary of malpractices would be entitled to claim vested right to admission in future.”Accepting Mehta’s argument on the leak being localised given the fact that the test was conducted in 4,750 centres in 571 cities and that cancellation of the entire examination would cause serious inconvenience to honest students who had assiduously prepared for the test for three to four years, the bench said, “The court is also mindful of the fact that directing a fresh NEET-UG test for the present year would be replete with serious consequences as more than 2 million students took the examination.“It would disrupt admission schedules for the medical courses, have a cascading effect on medical examinations, prejudicially impact availability of qualified medical professionals in future, and seriously disadvantage students from marginalised groups — SC, ST, OBC and EWS — for whom reservation has been made in the allocation of seats.”The bench further said, “For the above reasons, we are of the considered view that ordering cancellation of the entire NEET-UG examination is neither justified on the application of the settled position of this court or on the basis of the material on record.”Assuring the petitioners, who through lead counsel Narender Hooda and Sanjay Hegde had pleaded for a retest, the bench said it would independently verify the data submitted by NTA even after IIT-Madras on application of data analytics had found no abnormal trend in the results of NEET-UG 2024 in various centres, including Hazaribag and Patna.The SC said individual grievances of candidates, including improper evaluation of their OMR (answer) sheets, would have to be raised before jurisdictional high courts after withdrawing their pleas from the apex court.",Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected pleas for a retest for admissions to 1.08 lakh MBBS seats in govt and private medical colleges. 4.2 lakh students who had got 4 marks even after choosing a wrong option to an atomic theory question stand to lose 5 marks.

'Numbers don't lie': How first budget of Modi 3.0 reflects changed political reality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/numbers-dont-lie-how-first-budget-of-modi-3-0-reflects-changed-political-reality/articleshow/111964875.cms,"NEW DELHI: When finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim budget in February 2024, many were expecting it to be full of freebies with an eye on the 2024 general election. There were expectations that the government may announce tax cuts for the middle class and extra incentives for farmers and rural areas. But the Modi government did not announce much-anticipated freebies in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections .However, the interim budget was presented when the BJP commanded a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own. Officially, it was an NDA government but PM Modi was not dependent on allies for his survival. But things changed after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. After 10 years in power, the BJP failed to win a majority on its own in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. In a first for PM Modi, his government is now dependent on support from Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) for its survival.It is said ""numbers don't lie"". This seems obvious from the first budget of the Modi government 3.0. There is no doubt the Union Budget 2024-25 has been prepared keeping in mind the reality of changed numbers in the 18th Lok Sabha.This changed reality is self-evident in today's budget. Hence, no one should be surprised as the FM announced a host of bonanzas for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. The budget is full of schemes for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. Throughout her Budget speech, Sitharaman kept announcing special projects and funds for these two states.For details, read these stories on specific announcements for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh Next, another big focus of the Budget is on youth and jobs creation. ""I am happy to announce the Prime Minister's package of five schemes and initiatives to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over a five-year period with a central outlay of Rs 2 lakh crore,"" the finance minister said.The jobless-growth was one of the main criticisms of Rahul Gandhi against the Modi government. The government seems to have taken a leaf out of Congress's Lok Sabha manifesto and announced an internship scheme which would benefit 1 crore youth.""This budget serves as an acknowledgement of the jobs problem facing the economy. The word ‘unemployment’ never featured even once in the BJP election manifesto, said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale SA. The fact that there was a clear focus toward employment generation now shows the nature of the issue the government is dealing with,"" a Bloomberg report said.To be fair to the Modi government, there are no great freebies in the Budget. At the same time, the government plans to cut its fiscal deficit to 4.9% of gross domestic product in 2024-25, below the 5.1% figure in February's interim budget.""The budget successfully engineered a fine balance between supporting job creation and skilling, rural development and agriculture, along with continued focus on infrastructure spending without compromising on fiscal consolidation,"" Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank, told Reuters.But the budget is not all about elections and immediate gains. Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand are set to go for assembly polls during the last quarter of the year. But there are no specific announcements for these states. So, in a way, this is also a signal that PM Modi is not looking at elections only and playing a long-term game too.In the end, the budget has helped PM Modi keep Andhra, Bihar CMs on the right side. At the same time, it has done a fine balancing act between fiscal prudence and political exigencies.Now, it's over to voters in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand. These three state polls will decide the next set of political manoeuvring by the Modi government and INDIA bloc.","Modi government did not announce much-anticipated freebies in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections.

"2 Justices bench split, larger bench to decide GM mustard case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-justices-bench-split-larger-bench-to-decide-gm-mustard-case/articleshow/111970124.cms,"NEW DELHI: Twenty years after a petition was filed against introduction of genetic modification (GM) technology, Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered a split verdict on govt’s decision to allow environmental release of genetically modified mustard DMH-11. The issue will now be adjudicated by a larger bench .A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Sanjay Karol took contradictory stands on the validity of the recommendation of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) and the Centre for allowing environmental release of DMH-11 to allow its field trial.As the court had earlier stayed the field trial, the stay will continue till a larger bench adjudicates it and settles the controversy.While Justice Nagarathna held that the decision taken by the committee and govt was vitiated and the impugned approval was in gross violation of principle of public trust, Justice Karol said field testing of DMH-11 with sufficient safeguards and precautions ought to continue and cannot be said to be violative of the precautionary principle.Holding that independent risk assessment should be done indigenously and safety assessment and ecological impact cannot be transplanted from research conducted in a foreign country, Justice Nagarathna said that the constitution of the expert committee in 2022 itself was an eyewash, and the report of the committee was tailor-made in order that GEAC could accord approval.“Wisdom lies in precaution. As the upholder and protector of constitutional wisdom and values, this court has no option but to hold that the decision-making process for grant of approval for the environmental release of DMH-11 has violated the precautionary principle... The failure to adequately assess health and environmental impact of GM crops seriously infringes upon intergenerational equity as it potentially endangers the ability of future citizens to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health,” she said in her judgment.Justice Karol said that the conditional approval was in line with a developmental approach and scientific temper which has been supplemented with conditions imposed by the expert body, to facilitate mitigating measures qua the environment. He emphasised that the use of GM technology had to be seen against backdrop of India being a global agricultural powerhouse and rural India being still largely dependent on agriculture.“The development of scientific temper is to be read with another limb of the DPSPs (Directive Principles of State Policy) and Fundamental Duties enshrined in the Constitution that is Article 48A and Article 51A(g) respectively which speaks of protection of the environment. As already noticed above, these three parts forming the heart and soul of the Constitution have to be read as a whole and as such any and all considerations of modernising agriculture or building a scientific temper would also be required to necessarily consider and abide by the duty to protect the environment,” he added.",Justices B V Nagarathna and Sanjay Karol took contradictory stands on the validity of the recommendation of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) and the Centre for allowing environmental release of DMH-11 to allow its field trial.

The petition filed by Jhansi-based advocate Santosh Singh Dohrey came before a bench comprising Chief Justice Arun Bhansali and Justice Vikas Budhwar on Monday.During the hearing, the counsel representing the Centre sought time to obtain instructions regarding the matter from the government. The court allowed his request and fixed the next hearing on July 31.In the PIL, the petitioner sought quashing of the notification published in the Gazette of India on July 13 this year which declared June 25 as 'Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas', claiming it violates the Constitution.The gazette notification states that a proclamation of Emergency was made on June 25, 1975, following which ""there was gross abuse of power by the then government and people of India were subjected to excesses and atrocities"".""Therefore, the government of India declares 25th June as 'Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas' to pay tribute to all those who suffered and fought against the gross abuse of power during the period of emergency and to recommit the people of India to not support in any manner such gross abuse of power, in future,"" it said.The PIL plea argues that the notification by the central government directly violates the provision of the Constitution and hits the provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.The PIL contended that the language in the impugned notification is insulting and offending to the Constitution because the parliament, as per section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, has declared whoever whether by word, either spoken or written shows disrespect to the Constitution is an offence.It said that the proclamation of Emergency in 1975 was under the provision of the Constitution. Therefore, the respondents are wrong in declaring June 25th as "" Samvidhan Hatya Diwas "" as the Constitution is a living document ""which can never die nor anybody can be permitted to destroy it.The PIL also questions the rationale behind G Parthasarathi, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, issuing the impugned notification. The plea argues that, as a senior member of the Indian Administrative Services and an executive of India, Parthasarathi is oath-bound to follow the dictates of the Constitution.The plea alleged that he issued the notification to ""please"" his political superiors and to secure his important position in the administration.The PIL contends that all executive actions of the respondent must be expressed in the name of the President of India, as mandated by Article 77 of the Constitution of India.However, the impugned notification does not comply with Article 77, and the rules made thereunder.

The weapons were very heavy and had turned black,” said one of the 11 committee members who entered the treasury.Ratna Bhandar supervisory committee chairman Biswanath Rath told journalists that they have “carefully sealed and preserved the battle items in the temporary strongroom.”Rath, a retired Orissa High Court judge, did not divulge details about the weapons, their numbers, or the era to which they belonged.The discovery of the weapons sheds light on the 12th-century CE shrine’s connection to the kings who ruled the region, offering a glimpse into the treasures they accumulated over centuries.Anantavarman Chodaganga Dev of the Eastern Ganga dynasty built the Puri temple in the 1190s, according to sources in the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA). The 214-foot-tall temple is spread over 10.7 acres with 95 subsidiary shrines on its premises.“Jagannath Temple had been invaded and plundered 18 times. For the invaders, the temple was a lucrative source of wealth. To protect the temple, the then kings may have kept the ancient weapons in the Ratna Bhandar,” said Shyama Mahapatra, a temple servitor.According to Jagannath researcher Bhaskar Mishra, “King Kapilendra Deb in 1460 had emerged victorious over another ruler and used 16 elephants to transport a substantial amount of gold to Puri Jagannath Temple.”Historians and heritage researchers have demanded a proper study of the recovered war weapons. They said the government should enlist eminent archaeologists to study the period during which the weapons were in use.“These are very rare materials bearing historical significance . The weapons should be properly preserved and displayed in a museum,” said Sajiv Mishra, a historian.","The Ratna Bhandar, closed for 46 years, was reopened by the Odisha government on July 14 for restoration and inventory.

What is a 'bahi-khata'?

From briefcase to bahi-khata: The evolution of India's budget presentation

18th Century Britain: The tradition of using a briefcase for the budget started.

1860: British budget chief William E. Gladstone used a red suitcase with the Queen's monogram for budget papers.

1947: India’s first Finance Minister, RK Shanmukham Chetty, used a leather portfolio for the budget.

2019: Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the 'bahi-khata', replacing the briefcase.

2021: Sitharaman moved to a paperless budget, using a digital tablet wrapped in a 'bahi-khata' style cover.

Reason behind the change from briefcase to bahi-khata

Digital format for budget

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , adorned in a white silk saree, will present the Union Budget 2024-25 in Parliament using a digital tablet encased in a traditional 'bahi-khata' style pouch. This method continues the paperless format adopted by the Narendra Modi government.In 2019, Sitharaman replaced the colonial-era budget briefcase with a 'bahi-khata', and in 2021, she transitioned to using a digital tablet.This year marks her seventh consecutive budget presentation.The 'bahi-khata' is a red pouch that contains the digital tablet with the Budget documents. It features a golden national emblem and symbolises a shift from the traditional briefcase used in the past.The tradition of using a budget briefcase dates back to the 18th century in Britain. The term 'Budget' originates from the French word 'bougette', meaning a small leather briefcase. Here’s a brief history of how India’s Budget presentation has evolved:Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman replaced the briefcase with the 'bahi-khata' to ""break from the colonial legacy"" of the leather briefcase. After her 2019 Budget presentation, she emphasised the need to move away from the ""British hangover"" and embrace something uniquely Indian. She also found the 'bahi-khata' easier to carry.In 2021, Sitharaman adopted a digital format for the Budget, using a tablet encased in a 'bahi-khata' style cover. This move followed criticism from Congress leader and former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, who suggested that a future Congress finance minister might use an iPad. Despite the criticism, Sitharaman has continued with the digital tablet for the Budget presentations in 2021, 2022, and 2023.","The 'bahi-khata' is a red pouch that contains the digital tablet with the Budget documents.

What are the new income tax slabs under the new tax regime?

As per the changes announced by FM Sitharaman, following are the new income tax slabs for the new or simplified tax regime:

No tax for income up to Rs 3 lakh 5% tax rate for income between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 7 lakh 10% tax rate for income between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10 lakh 15% tax rate for income between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakh 20% tax rate for income between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 15 lakh 30% tax rate for income above Rs 15 lakh

Budget 2024 income tax changes explained: Salaried taxpayers have reason to cheer! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime during her Union Budget 2024 speech. These changes will give many salaried taxpayers a benefit of Rs 17,500 - provided that they are opting for the new income tax regime!“Coming to Personal Income Tax Rates, I have two announcements to make for those opting for the new tax regime…as a result of these changes, a salaried employee in the new tax regime stands to save up to Rs 17,500/- in income tax,” Sitharaman said.The standard deduction under the new income tax regime has been hiked from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Also the income tax slabs have been adjusted for FY 2024-25 so that the 5% tax rate is now applicable for income up to Rs 7 lakh. Some other changes have also been introduced.As is evident from the table above, at various income levels, the benefits will vary. The base income tax benefit of Rs 17,500 announced by FM Sitharaman does not include the cess. It also doesn't include surcharge at higher income levels. As per the analysis by EY, you will now have to pay zero tax of income up to Rs 7.75 lakh. For income up to Rs 10 lakh, you will annually save Rs 10,000 (without cess). If one were to include cess then the benefit will go up.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India explains, “The changes in the new tax regime will benefit taxpayers. For instance, under Scenario 3, where the gross salary is Rs 20,00,000, the total tax payable under the current new tax regime amounts to Rs 2,96,400, whereas under the proposed new tax regime, the tax payable is reduced to Rs 2,78,200.”“This translates to a direct saving of Rs 17,500 (excluding cess), thereby, highlighting the government's commitment to providing a more simplified and beneficial tax structure for taxpayers,” she tells TOI.","The income tax slab and standard deduction changes under the new income tax regime will benefit salaried individuals at what income level. The new tax regime has been announced by the Sitharaman government. The changes will take effect from January 1, 2015.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111958639,imgsize-77076,width-400,resizemode-4/111958639.jpg"

It is a 'save Modi govt' budget!"" he added.Talking to media persons, Kharge termed the budget as “disappointing” and alleged that the budget distribution is ""not need-based, but only to save the chair"".""We had expected the budget to address the long pending issues of the farmers including the legal guarantee for the MSP, subsidy on fertilisers and other things. But none of these things were mentioned in the budget,"" he said. He also referred to the caste census, saying the government had not allocated any funds for this purpose in the budget.Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said unemployment is the ""biggest challenge facing the country"" and the govt's response is ""too little"" and will have little impact on the ""grave situation"". He said the Economic Survey dismissed the issue of inflation in a few short sentences. The finance minister dismissed it in 10 words in para three of her speech, he said.Chidambaram also highlighted that the finance minister did not address the serious concerns affecting education like the NEET examination system and the scandal-ridden National Testing Agency. ""Several states have demanded that NEET should be scrapped and the states should be free to adopt their own methods of selecting candidates to various courses in medical education. But there was no response,"" the Congress leader said, expressing concern over the govt's failure to address this. ""I did not hear the finance minister refer to school education. Yet, the government is stubbornly clinging to NEET which, you will recall, is an examination at the end of school education,"" he added.The former finance minister also alleged that the finance minister’s speech reflects that she has ""virtually adopted the ideas underlying his party's proposals on Employment-linked Incentive (ELI) scheme, apprenticeship scheme with an allowance to the apprentice, and on the abolition of Angel Tax.”On the same issue Praveen Chakravarty, AICC spokesperson and chairman of Professionals' Congress and Data Analytics in a post on X took a dig at the govt saying, ""PM Modi called the Congress manifesto a ""Muslim League"" document. Today, his govt's budget has copy-pasted from it. And I am not complaining!""In another post he highlighted sections from the Economic Survey that refer to the employment linked investive scheme and revamp of apprenticeship framework essential for job creation. He also shared portions from the Congress manifesto where the party promised that if elected it would implement the ELI scheme and Right to Apprenticeship for jobs. ""Imitation is the best form of flattery!,"" he added.""However, the ELIs announced in the Budget raise questions about their effectiveness. The ELIs for first-timers provides one-month wage to all persons newly entering the workforce in all formal sectors. This scheme misreads the challenges India faces on two accounts,"" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X and elaborated on the challenges to drive home his point that what NDA govt is proposing in the budget is not good enough.""India’s key challenge is the lack of availability of jobs. This scheme rewards those who are already lucky enough to get formal jobs. The job-seekers who are unable to find employment - who are in much larger numbers and more urgently in need of aid – find no mention,"" he said.""India has faced difficulties ensuring that its women join the productive labour force. This scheme appears to be gender-blind, with no specific attention to women youth, and only rewards women who already find jobs. It fails to do anything to incentivize women to seek jobs,"" Ramesh added.""The two employer ELIs also need to be reworked. The INC had proposed delivering ELIs through tax credits, whereas the Budget delivers them through reimbursements for EPFO contributions. This delivery mechanism is effectively a subsidy on wages for these employed workers – whereas rebates on taxes would have been more compelling for firm owners and proprietors in encouraging hiring,"" he explains.Ramesh also highlighted that alongside unemployment, the budget is notable for finally acknowledging one other crisis. ""MSMEs - whom the PM and his govt have intentionally tried to debilitate over the last ten years – were a major talking point in the union budget. Aside from the credit guarantee for manufacturing MSMEs – for which few details have been made available so far – however the Budget failed to make good on some key policy proposals that could have revitalized the MSME sector,"" he said while listing out the challenges.""It appears that the personal, political, and moral defeat of June 4th has chastened this Government into admitting some key issues – but it has not yet whipped them into competence!,"" he concluded.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi slammed the budget as a ""kursi bachao (save the chair)” effort. They claimed that the Modi govt had borrowed ideas “generously’ from the Congress’ manifesto, but could not do so properly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111969847,imgsize-704510,width-400,resizemode-4/111969847.jpg"

Gold , silver , platinum and diamond jewellery are set to become much cheaper, thanks to proposed basic customs duty (BCD) cuts on these precious metals.The total import duty on gold and silver has been brought down from 15% to 6%. As a result, gold is cheaper by Rs 2,800 at Rs 72,700 per 10 grams (24 carats), while silver is cheaper by Rs 1,650 at Rs 87,350 per kg.With duties on platinum coming down to 6.4%, it will cost Rs 28,940 per 10 grams.""As a fallouot of geopolitical uncertainties, prices of all precious metals were significantly high. The duty cut will bring huge relief to customers in the upcoming festive season and the subsequent marriage season in buying gold, silver, platinum, and diamond jewellery. It will also boost demand for bullion and encourage investment in gold and silver exchange-traded funds as well as sovereign gold bonds,"" said Haresh Acharya, director of the India Bullion and Jewellers' Association.Several manufacturers had already begun passing on the Budget duty cuts to customers, with silver prices coming down, said Surat-based silver artefact manufacturer Mahesh Rungta.The industry is cheering. The diamond sector, currently passing through a rough phase, sees a reduction in prices, even though small, as beneficial in boosting demand.""The decision to exclude diamonds from the 2% equalisation levy on sales of rough diamonds will help to maintain India's leadership in the diamond industry and ensure operational sustainability.

India will be on equal footing with global centres like Belgium and Dubai,"" said Vipul Shah, chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.Due to the SHR, rough diamond selling will now be allowed in Gujarat Hira Bourse in Surat and Bharat Diamond Bourse in Mumbai.""Surat diamond manufacturers are major beneficiaries due to the rule as they can buy diamonds locally at a globally competitive price,"" said Dinesh Navadiya, chairman of the Indian Diamond Institute.","The total import duty on gold and silver has been brought down from 15% to 6%.

Proposals providing tax relief to the middle class are expected to put more cash in the hands of consumers-and more products in their shopping carts.The focus on the rural economy and job creation is also anticipated to translate into broader consumption, which will cheer retailers and FMCG companies struggling with stagnation in sales.Proposed deductions for salaried individuals and pensioners show a focus on stimulating disposable incomes of the middle class, said Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO at Marico.""We expect consumers to spend more because they would have higher disposable income . Overall, the emphasis on infrastructure and employment generation is likely to significantly boost demand for FMCG products ,"" said Mayank Shah, vice-president, Parle Products.Companies are banking on allocations for rural development to spur rural demand which is already showing some signs of revival.

The rest is accounted for by rural buyers.Budget announcements lifted most consumer stocks with the FMCG index on the BSE ending 2.5% up, highest among sectoral indices on the bourses.

The duty, previously at 20%, was originally introduced to support local manufacturing of smartphones.If companies decide to pass on the benefits, imported iPhone Pro models could get cheaper by Rs 3,000-4,000 and Google Pixel by Rs 2,000-3,000, Neil Shah, VP at CounterPoint said.Shah said Apple may gain $30-50 million in import savings due to the measure. While Apple makes the bulk of its iPhone devices in India taking benefit of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, the company still imports its Pro versions.Google's Pixel, which the company now wants to manufacture in India, is still being imported, though its market share remains very low.Dixon chairman Sunil Vachani, who is also the president of Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association, said the reduction in import duty will not have any impact on local manufacturing. ""The whole ecosystem is so strongly built in the country that we don't see any threat from import of finished mobile phones. Also, there are the continuing benefits of PLI in India.

Experts have given thumbs up for the new initiatives like an increase in MUDRA scheme allocation, housing for urban poor, job creation initiatives , support for higher education, etc. However, others point out that the budget failed to reach the high expectations of the finance minister.According to Mysuru MP Yaduveer KC Wadiyar finance minister presented a laudable budget, in particular one that promises economic growth, employment for our youth, empowerment for our women, and support for our farmers, alongside a cleaner, greener and more sustainable future.“The economic foundation for the Viksit Bharat vision of the Prime Minister was presented today by the Finance Minister via the Budget 2024-25,” he opined.“This budget is comprehensively covers all aspects of our economy, from farmer to corporate, and from labourer to entrepreneur. A big push for employment generation, women’s empowerment, farmers welfare, MSME support and much needed boost for Skill Development are some of the key features of this budget,” he said.“Provision of ₹11,11,111 crore for infrastructure will enhance our economic growth and power our nation toward our goal of becoming a fully developed nation,” he explained.Yaduveer observed that Sustainable Urban Development for our urban centers, addressing our urban housing needs via the commitment from PM Awas Yojana Urban 2.0, alongside prioritising our energy security and developing climate resilient varieties of crops is a key commitment to combating climate change and building a sustainable future for our country. “PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana is a landmark scheme that will ensure a movement toward a greener future,” he said.Mysuru Industries Association president P Vishwanath, and general secretary Suresh Kumar Jain welcomed the budget. They stated that this budget is pro- business, and pro Micro, Small, and Medium scale industries. They stated that various announcements including doubling the MUDRA loan amount, industrial corridor between Bengaluru- Hyderabad, support for the new employees etc are welcome announcements.However, a few other stakeholders from various industrial bodies, and other organisations expressed their disappointment over the budget speech. BS Prashanth, president, Federation of Organisations and Associations of Mysuru said tourism has been completely neglected in this budget. “Our Finance Minister has been selected from Karnataka but there are no notable contributions to Karnataka. There are many other potential tourism destinations in South India but only North Indian destinations are concentrated. This is a disappointing budget. Our MPs should raise voice about this,” he urged.All India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) district unit secretary Chandrakala alleged that this budget is encouraging students to suffer in debt trap.“Instead of reducing fees and increasing public funded institutions to reduce burden of educational expenditure on common people, government is asking students to take loans to meet the higher cost on education,” she alleged.“Allocation to education sector is is below 4% of total budget which is nowhere near even 6% allocation as recommended by their own NEP2020,” she alleged.Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers’ Association Kuruburu Shanthakumar alleged that this budget is not helpful to farmers. “There are no plans announced to find a solution for the problems of the farmers. The interventions announced in the budget will not be helpful,” he said.","The Union budget received mixed reactions from the stakeholders in Mysuru.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
