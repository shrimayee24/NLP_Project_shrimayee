KOHIMA: Nine cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) have so far been reported in Nagaland this year, prompting the state's health department to issue a public advisory calling for increased vigilance, especially during the ongoing monsoon season when the risk of mosquito-borne diseases is at its peak.The state's department of health and family welfare said that JE is a potentially severe viral infection transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant water sources like paddy fields and ponds. The disease can cause brain inflammation and lead to serious complications or death.""For every symptomatic JE case, there are likely 300 to 1000 asymptomatic infections,"" the department noted, underlining the importance of early detection and preventive action.Pigs, which act as amplifying hosts, play a key role in the transmission cycle. The virus, however, is not spread from person to person, the department said.""There is no specific antiviral treatment for JE; medical care is focused on managing symptoms. The typical incubation period is 5-10 days,"" it said.""The district health units have been directed to strengthen disease surveillance, carry out fogging operations, and raise public awareness. The health department has advised individuals experiencing sudden high fever, headache, vomiting, or confusion to seek immediate medical attention,"" the advisory said.The department also highlighted the need to boost routine immunisation, promote community engagement, and respond swiftly to any new cases.",Nine cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) have been reported in Nagaland this year.

BENGALURU: Weather permitting, the four-member Axiom-4 mission (Ax-4) crew, including Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux), is set to undock from the International Space Station (ISS) at around 4.35 pm IST on Monday (July 14).Hours after Steve Stitch, manager, Nasa commercial crew programme had confirmed the undocking date, Axiom Space confirmed the targeted time for undocking, beginning the homeward journey of the crew and culminating with a splashdown and recovery.The crew, which launched on June 25 and docked with the ISS the next day, has completed its planned 14-day tenure at the orbital lab and even “enjoyed a rest day” upon completion of two weeks.Now, even as teams from Axiom, Nasa and SpaceX prepare for the crew’s return to Earth, Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot Shux, and mission specialists Slawosz Uznanski and Tibor Kapu are making the most of their final days on orbit.The science being done at ISS, Axiom said, was “pushing forward a wide range of experiments that could shape the future of space exploration and improve life on Earth.”From testing of a special champagne bottle to work that could aid in allowing people with diabetes to travel to space, and from irrigating sprouts to gathering data to check if thoughts could control machines, Ax-4 mission had a research complement of around 60 scientific studies, including seven from India.Aside from India, the scientific investigations are from 30 other countries, including the US, Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia.“We’re conducting more research studies than any private ISS mission before. It’s not just about science—it’s about international collaboration,” Whitson, the Ax-4 commander and a veteran astronaut, had said earlier.India’s contribution includes a diverse portfolio of experiments in fields like biotechnology, agriculture, and human physiology, designed by institutions across Bengaluru, Dharwad, Thiruvananthapuram, and New Delhi.Among the Indian studies, one from IISc explored how humans interact with electronic screens in microgravity and investigated the resilience of tardigrades- microscopic organisms known for their survival capabilities.An experiment by InStem, Bengaluru, examined the effect of metabolic supplements on muscle regeneration in space, while testing the sprouting of salad seeds, critical for space-based nutrition, was designed by University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad.The International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), with NIPGR, designed the study to examine the behaviour of edible microalgae and cyanobacteria in space conditions. And Isro’s IIST, alongside Kerala Agricultural University, sent experiments to investigate how microgravity influences the growth of food crops.","Four-member Axiom-4 mission (Ax-4) crew, including Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux), is set to undock from the International Space Station (ISS) at around 4.35 pm IST on Monday.

Ahmedabad Air Crash: Black Box Of AI 171 Recovered From Crash Site After 28 Hours

Here are the key findings from the preliminary investigation report:

Fuel to both engines cut off mid-air: Just three seconds after liftoff at 08:08:39 UTC, the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were triggered, one second apart. ""The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,"" the report states.

Cockpit voice recorder captures pilot confusion: The cockpit voice recording reveals confusion in the final moments. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so."" Investigators are looking into whether the switches were triggered manually, inadvertently, or by a system malfunction.

Relight attempt on engines: The flight data shows that an automatic relight was attempted. Engine 1 briefly responded, but Engine 2 did not recover despite multiple attempts to reintroduce fuel. This failure ultimately made it impossible for the aircraft to maintain thrust.

Emergency RAT deployment: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source deployed in response to power failure, activated right after takeoff, a clear indicator of loss of electrical power to critical systems.

Mayday call issued moments before: At 08:09:05 UTC, one of the pilots issued a distress call: ""MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY."" The Air Traffic Controller attempted to confirm the call sign but received no further response. Seconds later, the aircraft crashed.

Aircraft crashed in nose-up attitude: Flight path analysis shows the aircraft hit buildings near BJ Medical College with an 8-degree nose-up pitch and level wings. With no thrust from either engine, the aircraft could not sustain flight.

Thrust levers found in idle post-crash: Although the thrust levers were in takeoff position during flight, they were found in idle after the crash. Flaps and landing gear were confirmed to be in standard takeoff positions, ruling out abnormal configuration as a factor.

Wreckage spread across 1,000 feet: The plane disintegrated across a wide zone, hitting multiple buildings. Debris, including engines and landing gear, was scattered over more than 1,000 feet, indicating the force of the impact and trajectory.

Aircraft airworthy, no fuel control issues logged earlier: The aircraft had valid airworthiness certification. Though there were some minor Category C and D MEL (Minimum Equipment List) issues, none related to fuel control. Notably, no previous issues with fuel cutoff switches had been reported.

Optional Boeing advisory not followed: While Boeing had issued an optional advisory on fuel control switch locking mechanisms, Air India had not carried out the recommended checks. The aircraft’s throttle control modules had been replaced in 2019 and 2023.

Next steps in investigation



NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIM) Saturday released its preliminary report into the tragic crash of Air India 171 in Ahmedabad on June 12, which claimed 260 lives.The 15-page preliminary report, released a month after tragic crash, details the early findings and current status of the investigation into the crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London Gatwick.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal global business summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit.

Air India acknowledges report

NEW DELHI: The initial probe into the crash of AI 171 has revealed that three seconds after getting airborne from Ahmedabad on June 12, fuel supply to both engines of the Air India Boeing 787 operating as AI 171 got cut off. The engines’ fan speed began dropping and the aircraft weighing 213.4 tons — which was close to its maximum take off weight with 54,200 kg of jet fuel — started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall. The reason: fuel cutoff switches of the London-bound Dreamliner’s engine 1 and 2 transitioned from “run” to “cutoff” position one after another with a time gap of a second.How and why this happened is not yet known. But what it led to is: The pilots issued a “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY” call 26 seconds after getting airborne and after that the crash happened within six seconds.The two pilots were taken aback by the unexpected fuel cutoff. “One of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” says the report prepared by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and made public early Saturday.As a result the engines’ fan rotation speed (N1 and N2) started decreasing even as the ill-fated aircraft weighed 2,13,401 kg on take off — close to its maximum take off weight of 2,18,183 kg. “The aircraft achieved maximum recorded airspeed of 180 knots indicated air speed at about 08:08:42 UTC (Greenwich time) and immediately thereafter, the engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of one sec. The engine N1 and N2 (fan rotation speed of different stages) began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off,” says the report.The aircraft’s “Ram Air Turbine” (RAT) got deployed during the initial climb immediately after lift-off as “both engines’ N2 (fan rotation speed) values passed below minimum idle speed,” it says. No significant bird activity was observed in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.Ten seconds later (08:08:52 UTC) the engines’ fuel cutoff switches for one engine transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN, resuming fuel supply. Four seconds later the same happened for the other engine. Engine 1 “started to progress to recover” with the other re-introducing fuel to achieve the same. However, by then it was too late. Nine seconds later (08:09:05), pilots transmitted “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY”.“The air traffic controller (responded).. did not get any response… observed the aircraft crashing outside the airport boundary, activated the emergency response. At 08:14:44 UTC, crash fire tender left the airport premises for rescue and firefighting.”“After takeoff, the aircraft impacted the BJ Medical College hostel which is 0.9 nautical miles (1.6 km) from the departure end of runway… As the aircraft was losing altitude, it initially made contact with a series of trees and an incineration chimney inside the Army Medical Corps compound before” crashing on the hostel.The AAIB report says “scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB (the ill-fated Dreamliner) in 2019 and 2023. However, the reason for the replacement was not linked to the fuel control switch. There has been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB.”Why did the fuel cutoff switch transition from “run” to “cutoff” for both the engines on June 12 on the Dreamliner may be known once the ongoing probe is complete.Without linking it to the cause, the report says US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had in Dec 2018 issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) “regarding the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. This SAIB was issued based on reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant airworthiness directive (AD) by the FAA. The fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models including part number 4TL837-3D which is fitted in B787-8 aircraft VT-ANB. As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory. The scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB in 2019 and 2023.”Soon after the release of the report, Air India issued a statement acknowledging the report. ""Air India stands in solidarity with the families and those affected by the AI171 accident. We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time. We acknowledge receipt of the preliminary report released by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) today, 12 July 2025. ""Further assuring their cooperation with the investigation, it added, ""Air India is working closely with stakeholders, including regulators. We continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses. Given the active nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on specific details and refer all such enquiries to the AAIB.""",Fuel supply to both engines of the Air India Boeing 787 operating as AI 171 got cut off. The engines’ fan speed began dropping and the aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall. The pilots issued a “MAYDAY MAYDAY MayDAY” call 26 seconds after getting airborne and after that the crash happened within six seconds.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122395467,imgsize-1436230,width-400,resizemode-4/122395467.jpg"
Air India 171 crash probe: Cockpit audio reveals pilots' confusion over mid-air fuel cutoff - 10 key points from AAIB preliminary report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-171-crash-probe-cockpit-audio-reveals-pilots-confusion-over-mid-air-fuel-cutoff-10-key-points-from-aaib-preliminary-report/articleshow/122395222.cms,"Here are 10 key findings from the preliminary probe report:

Fuel supply to both engines was cut off mid-air: Just three seconds after takeoff, both engines’ fuel control switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF within one second of each other, leading to sudden loss of thrust. Pilot confusion in cockpit: One pilot is heard asking “Why did you cutoff?” to which the other replied, “I did not do so,” suggesting a potential technical malfunction or inadvertent activation. Relight attempt failed on one engine: The flight data shows relight was automatically attempted and succeeded for Engine 1, but Engine 2 failed to recover despite multiple fuel reintroductions. RAT deployed immediately: The Ram Air Turbine (RAT), an emergency power source, deployed right after liftoff, indicating a total loss of power to essential systems. Mayday call issued seconds before crash: At 08:09:05 UTC, a distress call was made, just seconds before the aircraft impacted buildings outside the airport perimeter. Aircraft crashed nose-up but with engines off: Analysis shows the plane hit buildings with an 8° nose-up attitude and level wings, but with both engines inactive, unable to sustain climb. Cockpit controls in normal takeoff mode: Flap and landing gear levers were in standard takeoff positions; thrust levers were found in idle post-crash, though they were at takeoff thrust during flight — confirming an in-flight cutoff. Debris and wreckage strewn over 1,000 ft: The aircraft hit several buildings and structures, with components like engines, wings, and landing gears scattered across a wide crash zone near BJ Medical College hostel. Aircraft was airworthy with minor MEL issues: The aircraft had valid airworthiness certificates and a few Category C and D MELs (non-critical maintenance issues), none linked to fuel control. No prior issues reported with fuel control switches: While Boeing had issued an advisory (not mandatory) on fuel control switch lock concerns, Air India had not conducted the optional inspections. The aircraft had previous throttle module replacements in 2019 and 2023.

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released its preliminary report into the Air India plane crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad on June 12.The 15-page report, published early Saturday, outlines the initial findings and status of the investigation into the crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner headed for London Gatwick. The aircraft went down shortly after take-off, crashing into a medical hostel complex near the airport. Of the 241 people onboard, only one passenger survived.This was the first fatal crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, marking a significant and tragic milestone for the wide-body aircraft.A status report on the crash was earlier released by the civil aviation ministry on June 26.Also read: AAIB releases preliminary report, says fuel supply to both engines was cut off The investigation is ongoing.

Muslims are world's fastest growing religious group: Pew,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslims-are-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group-pew/articleshow/122396546.cms,"NEW DELHI: Muslims emerged as the fastest growing religious group in the world over 2010-2020, while the share of Christians - the world's largest religious group - in the global population fell by 1.8 percentage points to 28.8%, a Pew Research Centre analysis stated. Hindus grew at about the same rate as the world's overall population, reaching 1.2 billion in 2020, of whom 95% are in India.As of 2020, Hindus made up 79% of the population in India, compared to 80% in 2010. The share of Muslims rose from 14.3% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2020, revealed the analysis titled 'How the Global Religious Landscape Changed From 2010 to 2020'.Globally, people with no religious affiliation - sometimes called ""nones"" - were the only category aside from Muslims that grew as a percentage of the world's population, rising by 270 million and reaching 1.9 billion. The share of ""nones"" climbed by nearly a full percentage point to 24.2%.The research shows that the number of Muslims increased by 347 million - more than for all other religions combined. The share of the world's population that is Muslim rose by 1.8 percentage points to 25.6%.As a proportion of the global population, Hindus held steady at 14.9% in 2020. The figure was 15% in 2010. The number of Hindus worldwide grew 12% from 2010 to 2020, rising from a little less than 1.1 billion to nearly 1.2 billion.Buddhists were the only major religious group that had fewer people in 2020 than a decade earlier. In 2010, Christians accounted for 30.6% of the global population, followed by Muslims (23.9%), Hindus (15%), Buddhists (4.9%), unaffiliated (23.3%), other religions (2.2%) and Jews (less than 1%).The analysis draws attention to the various factors driving change in religious demographics. A key factor for Christians shrinking as a share of the global population is the widespread switching out of religion. This ""religious disaffiliation"" among Christians overrides their demographic advantage (high fertility).Muslim population growth is largely driven by their relatively young age profile and a high fertility rate. Hindus remain a stable share of the world's population because their fertility resembles the global average, and surveys indicate that Hindus rarely switch out of their religion.The analysis shows that Muslims had the highest proportion of children in 2010 (35% of the world's Muslims were under the age of 15), followed by Hindus (31%).The research observes that Muslims and Hindus are the least likely to gain or lose adherents from religious switching. About one in every 100 adults raised Muslim or Hindu has left their native religion, and a similar number from a different religious group have switched to Islam or Hinduism.","The share of Muslims rose from 14.3% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2020.

Judge seeks 'reasonable care' while invoking BNS' stringent Sec 152

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan without referencing any specific incident or mentioning India does not prima facie constitute an offence under Section 152 (act endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Allowing the bail plea of Riyaz, accused of pledging support to Pakistan in an Instagram post, Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal said a perusal of record showed ""the applicant has not mentioned anything which shows disrespect towards our country"".""Merely posting a message to...show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), but ""definitively will not attract"" Sec 152, the HC said in its July 10 order.Sec 196 of BNS provides for up to seven years in jail, while an offence under Sec 152 is non-bailable and carries a life sentence or imprisonment up to seven years and fine. The judge called for exercising ""reasonable care"" while invoking Sec 152 of BNS, saying it was a new provision stipulating stringent punishment, which had no equivalence in IPC.""For attracting ingredients of Sec 152, there must be purpose by spoken or written words, signs, visible representations, electronic communication to promote secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities or encourages feeling of separating activities or endangers the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,"" HC said.""Merely posting a message to show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), which provides for up to seven years jail, but ""definitively will not attract ingredients of Sec 152, BNS"", HC said in its order July 10.Justice Deshwal said spoken words or posts on social media are also covered under the right to freedom of speech and expression, and should not be narrowly interpreted, unless they are of such nature which threaten the country's sovereignty and integrity or encourages separatism.During the hearing, the applicant submitted through his counsel that his social media post did not lower the dignity and sovereignty of the country. Neither was India named, nor the Indian flag or any photo was posted which showed disrespect to the country, he argued. ""Merely supporting a country, even if that country is an enemy to India, does not attract the ingredients of BNS Sec 152,"" the applicant's counsel said.State opposed the bail plea, submitting that such posts encourages separatism.

Supreme Court Asks EC to Consider Aadhaar, Ration, Voter ID for Bihar Voter Roll Revision

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill. These documents are also in line with the prescriptions for centralized KYC, and ensure a homogenous identity.","Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship.

Shirsat, however, rubbished the claim, saying the bag only contained clothes.The allegation came a day after it emerged that Shirsat had received a notice from the income tax department seeking an explanation for increase in his financial worth between the 2019 and 2024 assembly elections from Rs 3.3 crore to Rs 35 crore. Last month, Shirsat and his son withdrew from a hotel deal after an opposition outcry.Raut said in his post that Union home minister Amit Shah should take note. “I feel pity for CM Devendra Fadnavis! How many more times will he just sit and watch his reputation being torn to shreds? Helplessness has another name: Fadnavis!” Shirsat said in response, “The house seen in the video is my home. It shows I am sitting (clad in a vest) in my bedroom. My pet dog and a bag are also seen. This means I have just returned from travel and removed my clothes. If I have to keep such a big bag of money, is there a dearth of cupboards?” Criticizing the opposition for raking up the issue “deliberately,” Shirsat said, “They see (currency) notes even in cloth bags.” He added, “Had there been money, I would have kept it in the cupboard.”Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray said sarcastically that Mahayuti legislators were showing disregard for the rule framed by Modi govt that a person should not handle cash beyond Rs 2 lakh on a given day.

However, he had to backtrack on his remark that Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde had received a similar notice and later clarified that he had no knowledge of Shrikant Shinde receiving any I-T notice.Shirsat, an MLA from Sambhajinagar West, had declared Rs 44.8 crore in cash and liabilities of Rs 26.5 crore in loans from multiple banks in his election affidavit in Oct 2024.

Meet the Poker tycoon hosting the star-studded Yacht parties with Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara



While gossip columns have been buzzing with speculation about a rumored romance between Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara, a much more intriguing story has quietly emerged behind the glittering backdrop of luxury yacht parties. The true star of this summer’s most talked-about celebrity gatherings is a man far from the Hollywood spotlight—billionaire entrepreneur Mark Scheinberg.As reported by TMZ, these lavish yacht parties, which have drawn A-listers from across sports, entertainment, and the influencer world, are being orchestrated by none other than Scheinberg, the Israeli-Canadian businessman best known for co-founding PokerStars. “Our sources say it's Israeli-Canadian businessman billionaire Mark Scheinberg's personal floating palace -- and he’s the one treating his famous friends to sun, surf, champagne . .. and some sexy fun,” the outlet revealed.For those unfamiliar with the name, Mark Scheinberg launched PokerStars with his father in 2001. The platform quickly dominated the online poker industry, turning into a global behemoth and eventually selling for a staggering $4.9 billion in 2014.Not one to rest on his laurels, Scheinberg shifted focus to hospitality, founding Mohari Hospitality, which invests in ultra-luxurious properties around the world.Today, he lives on the Isle of Man and boasts an estimated net worth of $5.6 to $6 billion. But Scheinberg’s fortune isn’t just fueling wild parties. Through the Scheinberg Relief Fund, his family has been actively supporting global charities and wildlife preservation efforts.Still, it’s his newfound role as the unofficial “host of the summer” that has raised eyebrows—and curiosity. His opulent private yacht has become the center of some of the most exclusive gatherings of the season. From NFL stars like Brady to Hollywood elites like Vergara, his guest list reads like a who’s who of celebrity culture.But Scheinberg isn’t handling these social affairs solo. Assisting him is longtime friend Doug Chabbott, who helps coordinate the guest lists. However, TMZ noted, “One source claims not every celebrity has said yes to their invitation. They've been turned down by some stars who thought it was odd being they didn't know Mark or Doug.”As for Vergara, while some speculated a budding romance, insiders insist, “Doug’s been linked to her in the past, but we’re told it’s all just friendly fun and nothing romantic.”So while the headlines focused on Brady and Vergara, the real story is the billionaire poker mogul turning heads with his secretive, star-studded floating paradise—proof that sometimes, the most fascinating people are the ones you’ve never heard of.Also Read: ""At the end of the day..."": Patrick Mahomes does not mind being snubbed at NFL top 100, his main goal is something else","Poker tycoon Mark Scheinberg is the man behind the star-studded yacht parties.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

In a bold and aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore). Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts.

Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. The difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

13-year wait ends with no keys: US-based techie wins refund after Hyderabad builder abandons project; told to be freed from loan dues too,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/13-year-wait-ends-with-no-keys-us-based-techie-wins-refund-after-hyderabad-builder-abandons-project-told-to-be-freed-from-loan-dues-too/articleshow/122399300.cms,"A US-based software professional, Krishna P Evuru, wins a legal battle in Hyderabad. He booked a flat in 2010, but the builder abandoned the project. The Telangana consumer court directed the builder to refund ₹12.5 lakh with interest.

After a 13-year legal battle, a US-based software professional has won a consumer court case against a Hyderabad builder. The court ordered a refund of ₹12.5 lakh with interest and compensation for abandoning the 'Green Grace' apartment project after collecting a significant portion of the cost.





HYDERABAD: A US-based software professional who booked a flat in Hyderabad 13 years ago has finally won a legal battle, but not the home he hoped for. The Telangana consumer court has ordered the builder to refund 12.5 lakh with interest and pay damages for abandoning the project, despite collecting most of the flat's cost.Krishna P Evuru had booked a unit in the 'Green Grace' apartment project at Khajaguda in June 2010. He paid 12.5 lakh upfront and took a home loan of 43.6 lakh. The builder had promised possession by June 2012, but the project was never completed.In 2016, Krishna through his general power of attorney holder in Hyderabad approached the consumer forum seeking a refund and compensation. The commission found the builder guilty of ""deficiency in service,"" noting that construction was abandoned even after collecting over 90% of the flat's cost.It also held the developer responsible for violating state norms by collecting more than 20% of the amount without showing adequate construction progress. The builder claimed delays were due to economic slowdown and political turmoil during Telangana's bifurcation. The builder also blamed the buyer for halting payments. However, the commission rejected these arguments, stating the developer had no valid justification for abandoning the project.Meanwhile, the bank that sanctioned the home loan was cleared of any wrongdoing. The court noted that it had disbursed funds in phases based on the buyer's approvals and construction updates. The commission directed the builder to refund 12.5 lakh with 9% annual interest, pay 1 lakh for mental agony, and 50,000 in legal costs. It dismissed the buyer's plea to recover home loan EMIs and pre-EMI payments, citing lack of evidence.However, to protect the buyer from future liability, the court ordered the builder to obtain a ""no due certificate"" from the bank and hand it over to the buyer. It also held that if any loan amount remained due after recovery under the SARFAESI Act, the builder must pay it. ""Opposite party (builder) is bound to clear the loan dues, if any, even after recovery proceedings,"" the court said.","Krishna P Evuru had booked a unit in the 'Green Grace' apartment project at Khajaguda in June 2010.

NOIDA: No constructions or tree plantations are permitted within a 20 km radius of the Noida International Airport without obtaining a 'Height Clearance' or 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), officials said.Noida International Airport on Friday issued an advisory to builders, local authorities, and other stakeholders, urging strict compliance with height restrictions in the designated area.Securing this clearance is not just a regulatory formality but a critical requirement to ensure the safety of flight operations and protect navigation infrastructure from possible obstructions, said the airport’s chief operating officer (COO), Kiren Jain.""As Noida International Airport nears commissioning, it is imperative for the public, real estate developers, and local authorities to strictly adhere to the height restriction regulations laid down by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to ensure the safety and efficiency of aircraft operations,"" Jain said in a press statement.The statement further emphasized that all stakeholders must first approach local authorities before undertaking any vertical development within the 20 km radius of the Noida International Airport.These authorities will refer to the Colour-Coded Zoning Map (CCZM) issued by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to determine the permissible height limits. Depending on the proposed construction height, applicants may be directed to apply for a Height NOC through AAI’s NOCAS portal, the advisory noted.This entire process is governed by GSR 751(E) — the Ministry of Civil Aviation’s Height Restrictions for Safeguarding of Aircraft Operations Rules, 2015 — which strictly prohibits unapproved construction within safeguarded airspace. Violations can pose serious threats to Obstacle Limitation Surfaces (OLS) and compromise critical navigation systems, thereby endangering overall flight safety.To ensure compliance, the Aircraft (Demolition of Obstructions caused by Buildings and Trees) Rules, 2023 empower authorities to take legal action, including demolition of unauthorized structures or trees and imposition of penalties under the Aircraft Rules, the statement said.All stakeholders — particularly builders, landowners, and residents — are strongly urged to cease any unauthorized development within the safeguarded zone and secure the necessary NOC from AAI without delay.Timely adherence to these regulations is crucial to maintaining safe, efficient, and unobstructed operations at the upcoming Noida International Airport, the advisory concluded.",No constructions or tree plantations are permitted within a 20 km radius of the Noida International Airport without obtaining a 'Height Clearance' or 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) from the Airports Authority of India.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

FAQs







TL;DR:Ask any expat who’s worked in Saudi Arabia over the last few decades, and they’ll likely tell you the same thing: your job title often defined your life. Whether it was a cleaner, a technician, or a surgeon everyone held the same general residency permit, known as an iqama, regardless of their skill set. That era is now coming to a close.As of July 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a completely new work permit system that ranks foreign workers based on their actual qualifications, experience, and income levels. In simpler terms, it’s no longer just about what’s written on your job contract but what you bring to the table.The new structure breaks workers into three categories:Everything is being managed through the Qiwa platform, a digital system under the Ministry of Human Resources. The scoring system considers multiple factors, from education and professional history to age and monthly pay.This reform is tied to something far bigger, that is Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.his national plan aims to push Saudi beyond oil and into sectors like tourism, technology, and more. And to get there, they need people who can build, code, design, and manage high-level professionals from around the globe.Projects like:These aren’t your run-of-the-mill developments. They require talent that fits modern, niche roles: climate specialists, AI ethicists, or urban mobility planners. That’s where the new visa tiers come in. The country wants to attract the right minds for the job.For expats already living in the Kingdom, the changes started taking effect in mid-June 2025, and the government has given employers a window until August 3 to update records.If you’re a professional, this might actually work in your favour:But if your job falls under the basic category, you might find yourself facing:This shift doesn’t necessarily mean anyone is being pushed out—it just means the criteria are tightening, especially at the lower end of the job market.To understand where things are headed, it helps to revisit where they began.For decades, Saudi Arabia used the kafala system, where a worker’s employer acted as their sponsor. The sponsor had sweeping control over many aspects of the worker’s life, from contract renewals to travel permissions.By the early 2000s, the system started facing criticism, especially from rights organisations. And so, the government began tweaking it.First came Nitaqat in 2011, which rewarded businesses for hiring more Saudi nationals. Later, with Vision 2030, came bigger reforms introducing more job mobility, removing some exit visa restrictions, and slowly moving toward a digitised labour market.Now, with this skill-based model, Saudi Arabia is making its boldest move yet, one that’s meant to fit the demands of a changing economy.If you're running a business in Saudi Arabia, this reform is a real operational shift.HR teams must now ensure:Mistakes here won’t just cause delays, they could result in penalties or rejection of visa applications. For larger firms, these processes might be manageable. But small and medium enterprises will need to adapt quickly or risk falling behind.While the skill-based model is a leap forward, not all older traditions have been removed. In practice, many expats especially in the lower skill brackets still need employer approval to:This shows that while the system is evolving, it still has legacy issues that need ironing out.According to data from early 2025, expats in Saudi Arabia send back over SR12.78 billion ($3.4 billion) every month in remittances.Under the new system:This could reshape how money flows back to India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, some of the biggest recipients of Gulf remittances.This reform isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger digital transformation, which includes:The end goal through this mission is a labour market that is traceable, fair, and more efficient.Whether you're a software developer from India, a nurse from the Philippines, or a construction worker from Bangladesh, this change affects you.For some, it may mean greater freedom, faster processing, and better benefits. For others, it might feel like an extra hurdle to stay in a country they’ve long called home.Q. What are the three skill levels in the new visa system?High-skilled (specialists like engineers), Skilled (supervisors), and Basic (manual labour roles like cleaners).Q. Can workers challenge their skill classification?Not directly. But their employer can submit updated documents and request a review through Qiwa.Q. Will this make it easier to bring family to Saudi Arabia?Yes, for workers in the high-skill tier, family sponsorship and long-term residency are more accessible.","Saudi Arabia introduces a skill-based permit system, transforming the expat workforce.

"Beijing, Ankara hail PAF’s combat edge amid tensions with India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/beijing-ankara-hail-pafs-combat-edge-amid-tensions-with-india/articleshow/122349627.cms,"After Missiles, China To Send J-10C Fighter Jets To Iran? Beijing 'Open To Arming' Allies





ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of coordinated praise, senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force following last month’s four-day conflict with India, a development seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.In back-to-back high-level visits to Air Headquarters in Islamabad this week, top officials from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the Turkish ministry of defence hailed PAF’s “decisive” response and “battle-proven” performance during the May clashes.China’s Chief of Air Staff, Lt Gen Wang Gang, met PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday and described Pakistan’s aerial actions as “a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”. He praised PAF’s integration of multi-domain operations (MDOs), calling it a “hallmark of modern air warfare”, and expressed interest in adopting elements of PAF’s doctrine for the PLAAF.A day later, on Wednesday, Turkiye defence minister Yaşar Güler offered similar praise. Calling the PAF’s performance “exceptional”, Güler lauded Sidhu’s “insightful leadership” and highlighted PAF’s role in the “resolute defence of national sovereignty”.He also proposed expanded cooperation in training, unmanned aerial systems, and disruptive technologies.Güler’s visit coincided with the arrival of Turkiye foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday, signalling coordinated diplomatic and military outreach as Pakistan seeks to shore up support from key allies.Neither China nor Turkiye elaborated on the details of the May conflict — downplayed by Islamabad and denied outright by New Delhi — but both echoed Pakistan’s military narrative, offering a diplomatic boost as Islamabad contends with regional isolation and growing India-West defence ties.Both delegations were briefed on PAF’s restructured posture, including its focus on AI-driven targeting and cyber-electronic warfare. PLAAF officials reportedly showed strong interest in the JF-17 Block III, a jointly developed fighter jet now equipped with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar and advanced avionics.The Turkish side proposed joint working groups to fast-track industry-to-industry ties — part of Ankara’s push to expand its defence footprint in South Asia amid rising collaboration with Pakistan on drones, pilot training, and aerospace development.The rare twin endorsements from two of Pakistan’s closest allies reflect a shifting regional balance, with China and Turkiye increasingly positioning themselves as strategic counterweights to India’s deepening ties with the US, France and Israel.While India denies any aerial losses, the external praise for PAF suggests otherwise, raising questions about whether these visits signal deeper strategic alignment or simply calculated shows of support.Islamabad and Ankara on Wednesday agreed to boost their cooperation in a range of sectors, including defence, trade, energy and infrastructure, aiming to enhance bilateral trade volume to $5 billion. This was agreed during talks between Fidan and Guler with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar here. “Pakistan would like to benefit from Turkiye’s expertise and experiences in this (defence) field,” Dar said. “We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar said, describing Turkiye as a ""trusted friend"" and a ""reliable brother”. ""We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said. He also mentioned finalising the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train.",Senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force. The development is seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.
