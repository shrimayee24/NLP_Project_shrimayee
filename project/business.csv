MUMBAI: Foreign fund managers , who have been cautious on Indian stocks since the Lok Sabha polls started in April, are expected to maintain the status quo: Neither go on investing with fresh zeal nor take money out in droves. Foreign portfolio investors feel that the lower-than-expected Lok Sabha seats for the BJP could limit their decision-making bandwidth in the coming days.Since April this year, FPIs have been net sellers of stocks in India and have net taken out nearly Rs 37,700 crore, including Tuesday's net selling figure of Rs 12,436 crore, data from the BSE and CDSL showed. Any major change in investment patterns of foreign funds in India could have a strong impact on the stock market, dealers said.""After a weak political outcome, we believe investors will focus on govt formation and the choice of prime ministerial candidate considering the BJP does not have a simple majority of its own,"" a report by foreign broking major UBS said. The other focus areas would be ""policy choices to support growth vis-a-vis ensuring macro stability, and the reform narrative"".UBS analysts said they would watch out for upcoming union budget announcements, implementation of labour laws and the next set of reforms in land and capital.""This was not an election outcome the market valuations were set up for. Indian valuations have been expensive for pretty ordinary corporate earnings growth/outlook. One of the arguments behind India's rich valuations has been the political stability/policy certainty afforded by a strong govt. Some of those assumptions could now come under question,"" the report by UBS said.A report by Societe Generale, another foreign broker, noted that the less-than-majority number for BJP on its own, unlike in 2019, could prompt the incoming govt to focus on subsidies at the expense of capex.","Foreign portfolio investors feel that the lower-than-expected Lok Sabha seats for the BJP could limit their decision-making bandwidth.

An economy that grew 8.2% in 2023-24, following two years of high growth, would normally have been seen as an electoral asset for an incumbent govt . Not only should a majority of people have seen a rise in living standards , but the ruling party would have made it a central campaign plank. Neither of those things happened. Reason: India is facing a jobs crisis , which sharpened the bite of rising prices .Plenty of signs showed that the inadequacy of decent jobs was a potent issue. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise because official data showed that while GDP, or economic output, bounced back quickly after Covid, it wasn’t accompanied by commensurate growth in better quality formal jobs .The single biggest indicator of the absence of enough job openings is the increase in the number of people classified as self-employed. In India, the high proportion of self-employed is an indicator of the weak link between GDP growth and the creation of formal jobs.The number of self-employed people in every 100 Indians in the workforce increased between 2020 and 2021. In 2022-23, not only were 57.3% of people self-employed, but about 18.3% of them were unpaid workers in household enterprises. The number has grown at work but without pay since the pandemic, showing that a sizable number of people did not gain from the GDP growth. Not just that, almost 46 of every 100 Indians working in 2022-23 were in agriculture, a level that was higher than the year before Covid.The absence of openings meant many who returned home to villages during lockdowns couldn’t return. Agriculture is the lowest-paying and most precarious sector.A look at swathes of India where BJP lost seats, eastern UP, north Karnataka, and east Maharashtra, all poorer parts of their states, indicates that the GDP trajectory bypassed many. With stagnant incomes, the impact of inflation was aggravated even if it was not high by historical standards.","India's economy grew 8.2% in 2023-24, following two years of high growth.

It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone. But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.”

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down huge global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries.

Stunning archaeological find: Prehistoric discovery in US lake leaves experts in shock and awe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stunning-archaeological-find-prehistoric-discovery-in-us-lake-leaves-experts-in-shock-and-awe/articleshow/110569138.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota , near Madison. This significant find includes a canoe dating back to 2500 BC. The Wisconsin Historical Society revealed the discovery on May 23, noting that the initial two canoes were found in 2021 and 2022.Dr Amy Rosebrough, State Archaeologist for the Wisconsin Historical Society, explained the importance of this find, saying, ""The Indigenous peoples of Wisconsin and the wider United States fished, traveled, and traded extensively on inland lakes and streams, and until now we have not had a clear look at the canoes used in the Great Lakes region."" She likened the discovery to understanding life in the Midwest without ever seeing a real pickup truck, emphasizing the crucial role canoes played in transportation and trade.Radiocarbon dating revealed that the oldest canoe dates back to 2500 BC, contemporary with the construction of Stonehenge, and much earlier than the founding of Ancient Rome or the birth of Jesus Christ. The youngest canoe dates to 1250 AD.Not all canoes will be removed from the lake due to their fragility. Rosebrough mentioned that divers also found stone tools in the water, suggesting the presence of an ancient village site, which has yet to be located. ""Even without finding the village, the discovery of these canoes and the tools found within the first canoe reminds us that people have lived and worked alongside the lake for thousands of years,"" she added.Efforts are ongoing to explore the lake further, using non-destructive remote sensing techniques to uncover more about this prehistoric site. Rosebrough highlighted the unique archaeological potential of smaller bodies of water like Lake Mendota, which often receive less funding than the Great Lakes but hold distinct historical significance.The Wisconsin Historical Society, in partnership with Native Nations in Wisconsin, aims to uncover and share the rich history of these discoveries at the new Wisconsin History Center, set to open in early 2027.","Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota.

"CFO of Trump-loving The Epoch Times arrested, charged with money laundering and bank fraud",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cfo-of-trump-loving-the-epoch-times-arrested-charged-with-money-laundering-and-bank-fraud/articleshow/110689900.cms,"What is the Epoch Times?

A top executive at a right-wing media company has been arrested and charged with laundering at least $67million in stolen money. Weidong Guan , a top executive at The Epoch Times was indicted by a federal grand jury, one count of money laundering and two counts of bank fraud .A report in The New York Times claims that Guan lied to a financial institution through the source of the cash, some of which was pilfered through fake unemployment benefits. According to the Justice Department, the money boosted The Epoch Times’ revenue by 400% in just one year.Guan, it’s Chief Financial Officer, was arrested on Monday and pleaded not guilty. Guan faces 20 years in prison for the money-laundering charge and 30 years for each count of bank fraud.The Epoch Times is associated with Falun Gong , a spiritual movement in China. For years, the outlet solely focussed on criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but more recently it became a prominent supporter of Donald Trump and his right-wing allies.Prosecutors claim that Guan ran a “sprawling, translational scheme” over four years to buy prepaid debit cards on the internet at a discounting using cryptocurrency and then deposited the cards’ money into both personal and company accounts. Prosecutors said that some of the money, loaded on the debit cards, was illegally obtained. Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York said the charges represented the government’s “commitment to vigorously enforcing the laws against those who facilitate fraud through money laundering and to protecting the integrity of the U.S. financial system”.Guan of Secaucus of New Jersey was in custody and faces a $3 million bail package, including a $250,000 cash deposit. He will have to remain in home detention. Meanwhile, the Epoch Times said that it will fully cooperate with the investigation dealing with the allegations against Guan.The Epoch Times was founded in 2000 in Georgia by current CEO, John Tang, then a Georgia Tech graduate student and a follower of Falun Gong. During the 2016 election, they embraced Donald Trump, and became enthusiastic supporters after Trump’s victory.Along with a newspaper, The Epoch Times runs a digital news site, produces podcasts and also operates the broadcaster New Tang Dynasty Television, better known as NTD.Its critics have accused it of spreading right-wing conspiracy theories and in 2019, Facebook banned the company on advertising on the platform after it was found to be obscuring its ad purchases in violations of transparency requirements. The Epoch Times also claims it’s the fourth-largest newspaper in the US, but since it doesn’t participate in industry audits, there’s no way to verify this claim.The money-laundering scheme started in 2020. The total revenue increased to $71million from $15million. The following year it jumped to $121million. While Guan attributed the financial results to growth in paid subscribers and donations from supporters even telling a member of Congress that the subscriptions accounted for the company’s growth.However, the money actually came from a criminal scheme involving an overseas-based team called Make Money Online. Even when pressed by banks or other trading platforms, Guan claimed they were donations from supporters. Guan also deposited $16.7 million of the proceeds into his personal accounts, income that he didn’t report.","The Epoch Times is associated with Falun Gong, a spiritual movement in China.

Was missing crypto-scam queen Ruja Ignatova murdered by a Bulgarian drug lord? New investigation tries to shed light on her disappearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/was-missing-crypto-scam-queen-ruja-ignatova-murdered-by-a-bulgarian-drug-lord-new-investigation-tries-to-shed-light-on-her-disappearance/articleshow/110672742.cms,"One conspiracy theory that has intrigued enthusiasts around the world for generations is the DB Cooper Escape. For those who don’t know, DB Cooper was the media moniker given to a man who demanded $200,000 in ransom and then opened the aircraft’s door and parachuted into the night over southwestern Washington, US. Despite numerous suspects and a manhunt for years by the FBI, DB Cooper’s body or whereabouts were never ascertained. It was never discovered whether DB Cooper lived or died, or who was the mysterious gentleman who disappeared into the night. The DB Cooper case took place in 1968 but like Cooper, there was another extraordinary criminal who simply disappeared into thin air: Ruja Ignatova .Ruja Ignatova made billions with a fraudulent crypto-currency before she suddenly vanished in 2017. A new BBC investigation tries to find out if she was murdered or just diseappeared. Ruja Ignatova was born in Bulgaria and raised in Germany, ostensibly pursuing a successful career in finance before being charged with financial fraud in Germany in 2012.She later returned with OneCoin , a fraudulent, non-existent crypto currency that was pegged as a Bitcoin killer. Between August 2014 and March 2017, people from across the globe, from Brazil to Yemen, invested in OneCoin. An FBI estimate puts the total amount invested at $4.5 billion.Millions donated before they realised that OneCoin wasn’t a cryptocurrency, doesn’t even have a blockchain and wasn’t a currency that could be used anywhere. FBI says OneCoin claimed to have a “private blockchain”. Actually, it when OneCoin users logged in to check their wallets, they’d simply see random numbers on a screen.In early 2019, she was charged by US authorities for wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. She was added to FBI's 10 Most Wanted in June 2022.In 2017, as investigators from Germany and the US closed in, Ignatova took an early morning Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens and was never seen again. Most of her alleged collaborators were arrested including OneCoin’s co-founder Sebastian Greenwood. He was detained in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the US. Meanwhile, Ignatova’s younger brother Konstantin Ignatov was arrested in March 2019 in Los Angeles. He pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges. Mark Scott, a former corporate lawyer was convicted in 2019 for laundering $400milion for the group. But Ignatova’s remained elusive.However, a recent BBC investigation claims that that a top mafia figure in Bulgaria, a business associate who was kept her safe might have been responsible for her murder. His name is Hristoforos Nikos Amanatidis, better known as Taki , who has a El Chapo-like image in his native Bulgaria.Over the years, Taki has been accused of numerous crimes including armed robbery, drug smuggling, and murder, but was never prosecuted in Bulgaria.Former Bulgarian Deputy Minister Ivan Hristanov said in 2022: “Taki is the ghost. You'll never see him. You only hear about him. He's talking to you through other people. If you don't listen, you just disappear from earth. The only person who can protect her from all those investigations, including from foreign agencies - it was Taki.”Taki, it’s believed now lives in Dubai, where Ignatova has a luxury penthouse and where her bank accounts received millions from the OneCoin fraud. Sources claim the two were close and Taki was even the godfather to Ignatova’s daughter. Frank Schneider, a former adviser to Ruja Ignatova, claimed his old boss was working with “gangsters”.A few months after talking to BBC, Schneider also disappeared. Meanwhile, document found at the home of murdered Bulgarian officer by Bulgarian journalist Dimitar Stoyanov of BIRD, an investigative website stated that a police informant had overheard Taki’s brother-in-law say that Taki had murdered, dismembered and dumped Ignatov off a yacht in the Ionian sea.Kuro, another associate of Taki was found assassinated in his Cape Town home in May 2023.Stoyanov, who was forced to leave Bulgaria after getting death threats, says property records show that Ignatova’s properties are now used by Taki and his associates in Bulgaria. However, Taki has never been arrested over the claims, Ignatova’s body was never discovered, and investigators don’t believe there’s enough to prosecute him.Only time will tell if Ignatova was murdered, whether she disappeared or it might not, and we might never learn her fate. Just like we never found out about DB Cooper.","Ruja Ignatova made billions with a fraudulent crypto-currency before she suddenly vanished in 2017.

How a 'rich young Chinese looking for love' cost a senior citizen his life’s savings in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-a-rich-young-chinese-looking-for-love-cost-a-senior-citizen-his-lifes-savings-in-us/articleshow/110651877.cms,"Pig butchering

Building trust

Financial manipulation

In a heartbreaking story, a 75-year-old professional from the American Midwest fell victim to an online scam known as ""pig butchering."" The ordeal began with an innocent LinkedIn message. The scammer, posing as a wealthy young Chinese woman, praised the man’s professional achievements and suggested moving their conversation to WhatsApp for more privacy. This marked the beginning of a sophisticated fraud known as "" pig butchering ,"" where scammers build a romantic rapport with their victims to gain their trust and access their finances.The scammers often masquerade as beautiful young women with abundant wealth and few worries, convincing their victims that they share a special, clandestine bond. In reality, they are frequently men contacting their targets from dystopian compounds operated by Chinese criminal syndicates in parts of Southeast Asia and West Africa. These ""scam dens"" are notorious for abuse. Many scammers are trafficked in, given scripts and smartphones preloaded with fake profiles, and coerced into committing fraud under threat of violence.As per a Wall Street Journal report, the scammer, who introduced herself as Violaine Chen , claimed to be a successful gold futures trader living in San Francisco. She shared pictures of a luxurious lifestyle and engaged the victim in daily conversations about her meals, workouts, and charitable activities. The victim, captivated by her seemingly genuine personality and shared interests, began to trust her implicitly.“She hooked me,” the victim said, reflecting on how deeply he was drawn into the scam.As their relationship deepened, Violaine introduced the idea of investing together on a trading platform called FX6, which she claimed was owned by her uncle. She guided the man through the process of setting up an account on a related app called Fuex and convinced him to make his first deposit of $1,500. The two began to plan a romantic future together, discussing a road trip in an RV and the possibility of the man retiring early.Despite red flags, such as warnings from his bank and the occasional strange message from Violaine, the man continued to invest more money at her urging. He sold stocks and mutual funds, ultimately depositing over $300,000 into the Fuex account. The app appeared to show their combined investments growing to nearly $1.5 million, the WSJ report said.However, when the man attempted to withdraw funds for a down payment on a house Violaine's uncle wanted them to buy, his request was blocked. Fuex customer service agents, who were actually part of the scam, informed him that his account was frozen and demanded additional fees to release his funds. Desperate, the man paid the fees using his remaining investments, a bank loan, and a home-equity loan.In the end, the man had lost $716,212 and was left with no money, no family, and no soul mate. Violaine blamed him for the situation and eventually stopped responding to most of his messages. The man reported the crime to the FBI but has had no luck tracing where his money has gone. He continues to try accessing his locked Fuex account every day, hoping for a resolution that may never come, the WSJ report said.He continues to grapple with the emotional and financial fallout of the scam, hoping his story will raise awareness and prevent others from falling prey to similar schemes.“Please answer me. I need to know what’s going on here,” he pleaded in one of his last messages to Violaine, a woman he now understands never truly existed.","A 75-year-old professional from the American Midwest fell victim to an online scam known as ""pig butchering"" The scammer, posing as a wealthy young Chinese woman, praised the man’s professional achievements and suggested moving their conversation to WhatsApp for more privacy.

Oil producers led by Saudis extended supply cuts amid slack prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oil-producers-led-by-saudis-extended-supply-cuts-amid-slack-prices/articleshow/110644871.cms,"FRANKFURT: Saudi Arabia and allied oil producing countries on Sunday extended output cuts through next year, a move aimed at supporting slack prices that haven't risen even amid turmoil in the middle east and the start of the summer travel season.The Opec+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, extended three different sets of cuts totaling 5.8 million barrels a day.International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month. Even the war in Gaza and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels in Yemen have not pushed prices up toward the $100 per barrel level last seen in September 2022. Reasons include higher interest rates, concerns about demand due to slower than desired economic growth in Europe and China, and rising non-Opec supply including from US shale producers,Yet the Saudis need higher oil prices to fund ambitious plans by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country's economy away from fossil fuel exports. Higher oil prices would also help Russia maintain economic growth and stability as it spends heavily on its war against Ukraine.Analysts say the cuts could push oil prices higher in coming months, but much depends on demand for oil going forward. The summer usually sees a spike in demand through the July-September quarter, but uncertainty about demand grows after that.US motorists have benefitted from weaker oil prices. Gasoline prices have been quiescent recently, averaging $3.56 per gallon last week, a penny less than a year ago. That is down from a record national average high of $5 per gallon in June 2022. US prices can vary by region and Western states have been paying more, with gas hitting an average $5.05 per gallon in California.US gas prices rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The price swings are much smaller in Europe because there taxes make up a bigger proportion of the price of fuel.The cuts that are being extended break down as follows: 2 billion barrels a day agreed among all 23 Opec+ members were extended through the end of 2025, according to an Opec statement.Then, voluntary reductions of 1.65 million barrels a day by a smaller group of members was extended until end 2025 as well, according to a report on the official Saudi Press Agency.And another 2.2 million barrels a day in voluntary cuts, due to expire at the end of this month, were extended until September but would then be gradually reduced month by month until they are eliminated by September 2025.","International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month.

"Improving energy resilience in Pakistan could avert 175,000 deaths by 2030, UNICEF says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/improving-energy-resilience-in-pakistan-could-avert-175000-deaths-by-2030-unicef-says/articleshow/110597885.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A new study by the United Nations children’s agency says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.UNICEF said improved energy resilience would also contribute $296 million to the country’s fragile economy over the next 20 years by reducing maternal, adult and infant mortality.The study, conducted by UNICEF’s Economist Impact Unit and released Friday, comes as Pakistan is experiencing an intense heatwave that has sickened thousands of people, further burdening the country's health care system.Temperatures in various parts of Pakistan soared as high as 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday. Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said. ""We need the private sector to play a bigger role as public sector resources will not be enough. This is everybody’s business.”","UNICEF says developing resilient energy systems to power health facilities in Pakistan could avert over 175,000 deaths by 2030.

Climate change threatens Pakistan's mango harvest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/climate-change-threatens-pakistans-mango-harvest/articleshow/110585002.cms,"TANDO ALLAHYAR: Pakistan 's mangoes are normally a source of national pride and much-needed income, but farmers are blaming climate change for the parasites and extreme weather ruining much of this season's crop.A white and orange scarf wrapped around his head in the scorching heat, farmer Muhammad Yusuf lamented the erratic weather.An abnormally long winter was followed by the wettest April in decades, while the country is now experiencing a heatwave with temperatures hitting up to 52 degrees Celsius (126 degrees Fahrenheit).""Buds didn't flower on time, many buds just died. Those that started growing were infected with (parasite) black hopper,"" said Yusuf, who has worked half his life growing mangoes.Now over 60 years old, Yusuf said ""climate change has wreaked havoc"" in his village of Tando Allahyar, around 200 kilometres (124 miles) northeast of economic hub Karachi.Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP .Further south in Tando Ghulam Ali , Arsalan, who manages a 900-acre mango orchard, noticed the damage as soon as the harvest started this week.""We have production losses of 15 to 20 percent, and the picking has only just started so this figure will surely increase,"" said the 32-year-old.Exports will be slashed as a result warned Arsalan, who goes by one name.""The mangoes turn yellow from the outside but remain underripe or overripe inside,"" he explained.Ziaul Haq, a mango grower and exporter from Tando Ghulam Ali, said the ""many attacks on fruit"" by pests were unprecedented.""This, in our history, has never happened before,"" he told AFP.The proliferation of parasites has led to an explosion in spending on pesticides.This uptick was confirmed by several farmers in Sindh province, where Tando Allahyar and Tando Ghulam Ali are located, as well as those in the leading agricultural province of Punjab further north.They told that chemicals are now used six to seven times per year, compared to just twice three years ago.Farmers in Sindh said they have been struggling since 2022 when a series of severe heatwaves were followed by unprecedented flooding, while those in Punjab said the declining crops yields date back several years more.""The losses in Punjab reached 35 to 50 percent and in Sindh, 15 to 20 percent"" compared to last year, said Waheed Ahmed, head of the Pakistan Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA).Speaking to local media, he said that last year Pakistan had only managed to export 1,00,000 of the 1,25,000 tonnes of mangoes it planned to sell abroad.Pakistan's 20 varieties of mangoes come second only to oranges as the most-produced fruit in the country.The income loss from a poor harvest could have a significant impact on the country, which is in talks to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Mashooq Ali, a 30-year-old labourer in Tando Ghulam Ali, wants the government to help farmers cope.""Landowners will earn less this year,"" said Ali, whose wife has started trading clothes to earn extra cash.""And even if they paid us as much as last year, with inflation, we won't be able to feed our families.""",Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest mango producer and agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of its GDP.

The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. The companies even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens, the WHO regional director added.Wazed pointed out that the response from governments and institutions lags in the matter.""Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry,"" she said, emphasising that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) '? including Article 5.3 '? should be implemented in letter and spirit.Also, necessary tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings, she added.""Our goal for our youth is clear. We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multi-stakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures,"" the WHO's South-East Asia director said.""This approach needs to cast a wide net.

'Rishi Sunak's new policies help Tories narrow gap with Labour',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunaks-new-policies-help-tories-narrow-gap-with-labour/articleshow/110541235.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In a sudden turn of events, the Conservative Party , led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak , has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election . According to a new poll conducted by JL Partners, Labour's lead over the Conservatives has decreased from 18 points in April to just 12 points. This shift in public opinion marks a critical moment for both parties as they gear up for what promises to be a closely contested election.Prime Minister Sunak's recent policy initiatives appear to be resonating with voters, contributing to the narrowing of the gap. The new policies, aimed at addressing key issues such as the cost of living, healthcare, and national security, have bolstered the Conservative Party's standing in the polls. Sunak's focus on economic stability and pragmatic governance has been a central theme of his campaign, a Daily Mail report said.One of the key factors in this shift has been the public's response to the government's handling of economic challenges. Sunak has emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility while promising targeted support for those most affected by rising living costs. His policies have included measures to reduce inflation, support small businesses, and ensure that public services are adequately funded.Labour leader Keir Starmer, who had been enjoying a comfortable lead for several months, now faces increased pressure to maintain his party's advantage. Starmer's campaign has focused on issues such as social justice, public health, and education reform. However, the recent poll suggests that some voters may be reconsidering their support in light of the Conservative Party's renewed efforts.The tightening race reflects the dynamic and unpredictable nature of British politics. As both parties ramp up their campaigns, they are likely to intensify their efforts to sway undecided voters and solidify their bases. The Labour Party will need to reinforce its message and address any vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the narrowing gap.Political analysts suggest that the upcoming weeks will be crucial for both parties. The Conservatives will aim to continue their momentum by highlighting their recent policy successes and outlining their vision for the future. Meanwhile, Labour will need to counteract this by emphasizing their commitment to addressing inequality and improving public services.The public's perception of the leaders' performances will also play a significant role in the election outcome. Sunak's leadership style, characterized by his economic expertise and calm demeanor, contrasts with Starmer's focus on social issues and reform. Voters' evaluations of these contrasting approaches will be critical in determining the final result, the Daily Mail report said.As the election date approaches, both parties will be keenly aware of the importance of maintaining voter engagement and addressing the key concerns of the electorate. The race is expected to be highly competitive, with each party striving to gain the upper hand.The poll results have injected a new sense of urgency into the campaigns, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election. With the gap between the parties narrowing, the outcome remains uncertain, and both Sunak and Starmer will need to navigate the complexities of the political landscape to secure a victory.",The Conservative Party has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election.

Mohammed vs John: Your name may decide car insurance premium in UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mohammed-vs-john-your-name-may-decide-car-insurance-premium-in-uk/articleshow/110541073.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: An investigation has uncovered a significant discrepancy in car insurance premiums between drivers named Mohammed and those with traditionally British names like John . This revelation has ignited a debate about potential biases within the car insurance industry and the fairness of its pricing strategies .The study, conducted by the Daily Mail, involved requesting car insurance quotes from leading insurance companies for drivers with identical profiles but different names. The findings were striking: drivers named Mohammed were consistently quoted higher premiums than their counterparts named John. This difference in pricing has raised concerns about possible discrimination based on names, which often serve as indicators of ethnicity.One example highlighted by the study showed that a driver named Mohammed was quoted £1,333 for a year's coverage, while a driver named John with the same profile was quoted only £1,268. This pattern was repeated across multiple insurance providers, suggesting that the disparity is not an isolated incident, the Daily Mail report said.The insurance industry has defended its pricing practices. A spokesperson said, ""Insurance premiums are calculated based on a wide range of factors, including risk assessment data and historical claims information. We do not discriminate based on names."" However, the results of the investigation suggest that there may be an implicit bias in the risk assessment algorithms or historical data used to determine premiums.Consumer rights advocates are calling for greater transparency in how insurance premiums are determined. They argue that the current system may unfairly penalize individuals based on their name or perceived ethnicity. One advocate emphasized, ""It's crucial that the insurance industry addresses these disparities to build trust and provide fair treatment for all customers.""The implications of these findings are significant. If names can influence insurance premiums, it suggests that other forms of implicit bias may also be affecting the financial services industry. This calls into question the fairness and equity of other pricing and risk assessment practices.Calls for regulatory oversight and investigation into the insurance industry's pricing practices are growing louder. Lawmakers and consumer protection agencies are being urged to examine whether these disparities constitute a violation of anti-discrimination laws. An industry-wide review could lead to reforms designed to ensure that all customers are treated equitably, regardless of their name or ethnic background, the Daily Mail report added.This report contributes to the broader conversation about systemic biases in various sectors and underscores the importance of addressing these issues to ensure equitable treatment for all individuals. The insurance industry, like many others, faces the challenge of ensuring that its practices do not inadvertently perpetuate discrimination.",An investigation has uncovered a significant discrepancy in car insurance premiums between drivers named Mohammed and those with traditionally British names like John.

The offer, valued at £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion), was deemed ""fair and reasonable"" by IDS chairman Keith Williams. EP Group already holds a 27.6 percent stake in IDS, and the takeover is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.Royal Mail, a former state monopoly privatised in 2013, has seen its core letters business suffer as consumers increasingly communicate online. However, this shift has benefited its international parcels business, GLS.Britain's communications regulator, Ofcom, has proposed reducing Royal Mail's delivery frequency to five or even three days per week, potentially saving the company hundreds of millions of pounds. IDS has long advocated for a reform of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week to all 32 million addresses in the UK for the price of a stamp.EP Group sees IDS as ""a strong business with solid foundations and the potential to become one of the leading postal logistics groups in Europe"", subject to modernisation that includes USO reform.Kretinsky expressed his group's ""utmost respect for Royal Mail's history and tradition"", acknowledging the responsibility that comes with owning a business with more than 500 years of history. The accepted offer was priced at 370 pence per IDS share, and following the announcement, IDS stock rose 2.9 percent to 330.5 pence in early London trading.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that GLS has long been considered the ""jewel in the company's crown"", enjoying a level of success that Royal Mail has struggled to achieve, and EP Group will have been eyeing the long-term opportunities in this area. EP has committed to honouring IDS management's promise not to impose compulsory redundancies at Royal Mail until April next year.Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, plans to meet with EP next week to call for further commitments on the company's future. IDS employs approximately 153,000 staff, with the vast majority representing Royal Mail.","International Distribution Services (IDS) has accepted a takeover proposal from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's conglomerate, EP Group.

Johannesson, who did not seek re-election after two four-year terms. Tomasdottir will take office on Aug. 1.Iceland, a Nordic island nation located in the North Atlantic, has about 384,000 people and a long tradition of electing women to high office. Vigdis Finbogadottir was the first democratically elected female president of any nation when she became Iceland's head of state in 1980.The country has also seen two women serve as prime minister in recent years, providing stability during years of political turmoil. Johanna Sigurdardottir led the government from 2009-2013, after the global financial crisis ravaged Iceland's economy. Jakobsdottir became prime minister in 2017, leading a broad coalition that ended the cycle of crises that had triggered three elections in four years. She resigned in April to run for president.Tomasdottir first rose to prominence during the financial crisis, when she was hailed as the co-founder of Audur Capital, one of the few Icelandic investment firms that survived the upheaval. She is currently on leave as chief executive of the B Team, a non-profit organization that works to promote workplace diversity and has offices in New York and London.","Halla Tomasdottir, a businesswoman and investor, has won Iceland's presidential election.

EU elections litmus test for Europe climate action plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-elections-litmus-test-for-europe-climate-action-plan/articleshow/110631082.cms,"The world's most ambitious climate plan has become a major political liability. Public support for the European Union's Green Deal , aimed at eliminating carbon emissions by 2050, is under threat as an energy crisis hits voters' wallets. A flood of incentives for clean technologies unleashed by the US and China has also stoked concerns that Europe's sticks-over-carrots approach will make it less competitive.The extent of the damage will be made clear when citizens vote in parliamentary elections from June 6 to June 9. In their campaigns, leading mainstream candidates have shifted from framing the climate action as a way for Europe to lead globally to focusing on how they'll protect domestic industries and limit the cost to households. Meanwhile, discontent over everything from boiler bans to sustainable farming directives has helped climate-skeptic right-wing parties gain support.""Many people feel the democratic parties have failed to find credible solutions to their daily problems and they view the climate transition as a financial burden,"" said Dirk Messner, president of Germany's Environment Agency.While polls show that a coalition of mainstream parties is forecast to retain a majority in the EU Parliament for its next five-year term, the gravity is shifting to the right. Far-right groups are set to increase their number of seats.The challenge for the next European Commission, which will be formed after the vote, and the 27 member states, will be to find more funding for the Green Deal even as other pressures mount. Many member states want to boost defence spending amid a worsening geopolitical environment following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.It's a dilemma with no easy solution. Economic growth is sluggish, inflation is sticky and government budgets are strained just as the EU approaches the hardest stretch of its net-zero campaign. The bloc had barely started including the agriculture sector in its green regulations when it was forced to soften the policies after farmers blocked highways and dumped manure in the streets.In 2027, it's set to launch a new carbon market to cut pollution from heating and road transport fuels - a move that will impact consumers. By 2035, all new passenger cars will need to be emissions-free, effectively putting an end to the internal combustion engine. ""There's a perfect storm brewing,"" said Simone Tagliapietra, senior researcher at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Those measures will hit consumers just as the EU reduces green grants.The backlash has overshadowed the achievements of the Green Deal. The EU managed to overcome national differences and adopt a massive package of measures to reach a tougher emissions reduction goal of least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Pollution dropped 32.5% from 1990 to 2022, even as the economy grew by 67%.

The Middle East carrier is looking at ordering about 200 jets, looking at a mix of Airbus A350s and Boeing 777X models , with a decision possible as soon as the Farnborough Air Show in Britain late next month, the report said.

Qatar Airways, Boeing and Airbus did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Bloomberg had reported in March that Qatar Airways was in early talks with Boeing and Airbus, to order 100 to 150 widebody jets to expand and renew its fleet.

Major airlines are in a race to procure new fuel-efficient widebody jets to keep operating costs down and to cater to booming international travel demand.

Feeling flush: Japan's high-tech toilets go global,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/feeling-flush-japans-high-tech-toilets-go-global/articleshow/110649653.cms,"'Smartest toilet'

'Does it hurt?'

KITAKYUSHU: As Japan plays host to a record influx of tourists, one of the country's more private attractions -- the high-tech toilet -- is becoming a must-have in luxury bathrooms worldwide.With their warm seats and precision spray technology, bidet toilets are the norm in Japan, where more than 80 percent of homes have one, according to a government survey.Now sales are surging abroad and especially in the United States, led by A-list bidet fans such as Drake, the Kardashians and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Japanese company TOTO , which pioneered the electric bidets it claims have sparked ""a global revolution from wiping to washing"", says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.The pandemic was a key driver, bringing a home-renovation boom but also germ-conscious consumers desperate for an alternative to toilet paper after shelves were cleared by panic-buyers.Senior TOTO executive Shinya Tamura, who oversees international business, told AFP the brand's growth has been a word-of-mouth success.When people first learn how the toilets' water jets work, with pressure and temperature controls, ""there's an image that it's not pleasant"".But ""we can't explain how good it is with words. You need to experience it"", Tamura said.""After a while, most users can't live without it.""The company's international net sales for housing equipment are currently less than a third of those in Japan.It wants to boost sales in the Americas by 19 percent over two years to ""establish a solid position"" there and offset less urgent demand in China.But with more people in the market for a squeaky clean bum, US competitors are challenging TOTO and its Japanese rivals such as Panasonic and LIXIL for their throne.At a major tech fair in Las Vegas this year, the marketing manager of US brand Kohler called its Numi 2.0 -- which takes spoken instructions via an in-built Amazon Alexa -- ""the smartest toilet that exists"".Just like top-end Japanese models, the Numi 2.0 has an automatic deodoriser and a motion-activated lid that opens when you enter the bathroom and closes when you leave.Its spray wand has pulsating and oscillating functions, and users can adjust the warm-air dryer in minute detail.But such pampering comes at a price: around $8,500 to $10,000, compared to around $500 for more basic bidet seats.Americans who travel to Japan are often inspired to upgrade their toilet, a salesman at Ardy's Bath Collection in Beverly Hills told AFP.""They see it in the airport, and they see it in public restrooms, and they use it, and they're like, 'wow, this is great,'"" he said.Bidets are ""popular everywhere"" but it's still a ""private experience"" and ""weird to talk about"" for some customers.Although fancy Japanese-style toilets are fast becoming a status symbol, TOTO's executives have long fought prudishness when trying to expand abroad.After the US launch of its Washlet bidet in 1986, the firm struggled to place advertisements, and its pop-up event was kicked out of a high-end mall because other stores complained.","Japanese company TOTO says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.

Notes Slip Out

Treat For

Divers

On July 2, 1918, towards the end of WW-1, a British ship named ' SS Shirala ' sank in the English Channel. Its 'killer' was the dreaded German submarine UB-57, commanded by Oberleutnant Johannes Lohs who destroyed dozens of enemy ships with a combined capacity of over 1.5 lakh tonnes before he died aged 29.The Shirala accounted for just about 4% of Lohs' kills, but it was destined to make headlines long after death, as it's doing now. Sometime this afternoon, two Rs 10 notes and a Re 1 note salvaged from its wreck will go under the hammer at British auction house Noonans Mayfair. The Rs 10 notes could fetch up to £2,600 (Rs 2.7 lakh) each.The Shirala was a small ship, just 425 feet long and 50 wide. It was launched on Aug 31, 1901, and had gone around the world many times for the British India Steam Navigation Company, carrying everything from biscuits to railway sleepers.But when it set out on its final journey to Bombay, on July 1, 1918, it was also loaded with precious cargo. Some say there were diamonds on board, others mention elephant tusks. It certainly had plenty of marmalade jars - specifically, Dundee marmalade - for the British in India and spares for their vehicles and weapons. Above all, the Shirala was bringing new currency notes . There were unsigned notes of Rs 5 and Rs 10 denominations, besides signed Re 1 notes. The Re 1 note had been introduced very recently, on Nov 30, 1917. Until then, Rs 5 had been the smallest denomination for notes in India. An article in the International Bank Note Society Journal says Re 1 notes used to come pre-signed from Britain, so when the Shirala sank, it became the ""first case of notes lost at sea which were pre-signed before their arrival in India from England"".The bigger notes were sent unsigned from Britain, and would have become legal tender only after receiving the signatures of officials at the Indian Currency Office. As the Shirala sank in shallow water close to the English coast, bits of its cargo started washing up on the shore. Among them were notes of all three denominations.In its Feb 6, 1920 edition, The Pioneer Mail of Allahabad reported that ""Some of the notes were saved and have recently made their appearance at the Currency Office in Rangoon from local banks."" In some cases, notes from the Shirala were presented with forged signatures. ""So far, eight of these notes are in custody of the authorities... All are of Rs 5 denomination,"" the paper said.Some of the Shirala's rupee notes stayed with their finders, which is why, after 106 years, they are up for auction. Meanwhile, the ship's wreck has become an attraction for divers. Historic England, which looks after British heritage sites, says Shirala's holds still contain ""cases of wine; crates of Dundee marmalade; spares for vehicles ...binoculars and telescopes; some ivory..."" But what you might not find now, after a century under water, are its rupee notes.","SS Shirala, a British ship, sank in the English Channel in 1918.
