"Toll on under expansion 2-lane highways to be halved, partially opened e-ways to be on par with NHs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toll-on-under-expansion-2-lane-highways-to-be-halved-partially-opened-e-ways-to-be-on-par-with-nhs/articleshow/126297492.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a relief for highway commuters, toll on under expansion stretches — from two-lane to four-lane — will soon be halved during the construction period and the user fee on partially opened expressways such as Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar-Jamnagar will be same as that of other NHs. At present, the toll on expressways is 1.25 times of other NH stretches.TOI has learnt that the finance ministry has given the green light to the two proposals from the road transport and highways ministry. The latter had proposed to halve toll during expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders to four-lane highways since commuters don’t get the desired service as the width of road gets reduced available while construction is underway.Currently, during expansion of a two-lane highway to four lanes, the toll charged is around 60% of the normal NH toll. With the concurrence of the finance ministry to the proposal, soon user fee will drop to 30% of normal toll during the construction phase. The finance ministry has asked the highways ministry to monitor and ensure strict enforcement of penalties on contractors for missing timeline in such widening projects.Officials said that while giving the go ahead for bringing toll rates on partially opened expressways on par with other NHs, the finance ministry said such relief should be for one year or till the expressway is fully operational, whichever is earlier. The highways ministry had submitted that vehicles, particularly heavy commercial vehicles, were not using expressways for higher toll rates.The finance ministry has said a decision on continuing this relaxation beyond one year may be taken based on actual uptake of traffic on such expressways. It has also asked the highways ministry to impose penalties on contractors for delay in completion of works.","The user fee on partially opened expressways such as Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar- Jamnagar will be same as that of other NHs.

180 Kmph While You Sleep! India's Latest Vande Bharat Sleeper Marks New Era. Check Fares, Features

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month, barely months before the assembly polls in Assam and West Bengal. The train, marking a major upgrade in overnight train travel running at 120-130 kmph, will also reduce the travel time between two eastern capitals by more than three hours.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the first route of the indigenously built modern train that has a design speed of 180 kmph. PM is likely to visit Assam and West Bengal in the third week of this month. Responding to a question on the reason for choosing the route connecting two poll-bound states, Vaishnaw said the decision is part of PM's thrust on development in east and northeast India under the ""purvodaya"" scheme.The minister said that in the next six months eight more such trains catering to 1,200-1,500 km routes will be rolled out and by December this number will reach 12. ""From next year onwards, production will be ramped up rapidly as the entire supply chain will be in place by then,"" he added.Giving details of the first service, he said it will run six days a week and the one-way fare will be Rs 2,300 for 3AC, Rs 3,000 for 2AC and Rs 3,600 for 1AC travel.He added for the first time, the national transporter has decided to have a fixed rate of fare for each class of travel in these trains - Rs 2.4, Rs 3.1 and Rs 3.8 per km for third, second and first AC, meaning there will be no dynamic pricing. ""You will see several reforms in railways in 2026. This is one of them,"" Vaishnaw said. While passengers originating from Guwahati will be served Asamese cuisine, those starting from Kolkata will get Bengali food.On the special features of the train, Vaishnaw said the riding comfort can be compared with best trains across the globe and the AC system ensures there is adequate oxygen content in air to ensure passengers face no discomfort.Vaishnaw also gave details of progress made in fencing of tracks, upgradation of around 79% network and upgradation in the Over Head Equipment (OHE), the system of overhead cables, masts, and insulators that supplies high-voltage electricity to power electric trains, enabling trains to run at a higher speed. He added that with the expansion of railway infrastructure, they are hopeful of running more trains and they are hopeful of ending waitlisted tickets in some sectors in the next 2-3 years.","PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month.

New Labour Codes pre-published: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances. Any allowance, excluding gratuity and retrenchment compensation, that exceeds 50 percent of total remuneration will be added back to wages for statutory calculations, while items such as performance incentives.Puneet Gupta, Partner, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India says that the draft central rules under the four labour codes provide clarity on several operational aspects that employers have been awaiting.“For instance, the Code on Social Security Rules specify that gratuity will be calculated on ‘wages’ last drawn, excluding components such as annual performance-linked pay, medical reimbursements, stock options, and meal vouchers. This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

'India Will Be 3rd Largest Economy': PM Modi Sounds Warning To Trump, Says World is Betting on Delhi

India Becomes Fourth Largest Economy

High Growth, Low Inflation - The Goldilocks Situation

In a major feat, India has moved past Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms, according to the government’s year-end economic review. Not only that, the Indian economy is set to overtake Germany to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. A final confirmation will depend on the data released by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the first half of 2026 when the final figures for 2025 will be released.“With GDP valued at $4.18 trillion, India has surpassed Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy and is poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years with projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030,” the government release said.India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now. The size of its economy has doubled in the last ten years, and it is now eyeing the position of being the third largest in the world.A government economic note issued late Monday highlighted that India remains one of the fastest-expanding major economies globally and is well placed to maintain its growth pace.IMF forecasts for 2026 value India’s economy at $4.51 trillion, slightly above Japan’s projected $4.46 trillion.The government’s optimistic outlook comes even as the economy faces headwinds following the imposition of steep US tariffs in August linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Recent high-frequency data signals that economic momentum is holding firm. Inflation has stayed below the lower bound of the tolerance band, joblessness is easing, and exports are showing steady improvement, the government review noted.Financial conditions also remain supportive, marked by healthy credit expansion to businesses, while demand continues to be resilient, aided by a further pickup in urban consumption.India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY 2025-26, accelerating from 7.8% in the preceding quarter and 7.4% in the final quarter of FY 2024-25. This growth was driven by strong domestic demand, even as global trade and policy uncertainties persisted. Real gross value added rose 8.1%, underpinned by solid performance in the industrial and services sectors.The Reserve Bank of India raised its growth projection for FY 2025-26 to 7.3%, up from 6.8% earlier. The upward revision factors in sustained domestic demand, rationalisation of income tax and GST, softer crude prices, an early push in government capital spending, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions, all supported by contained inflation.“Ongoing reforms are likely to further enable growth prospects. The present macro-economic situation presents a rare “goldilocks period” of high growth and low inflation,” the review said.CPI inflation stood at 4.26% in January and gradually moderated over the first half of the year, before declining further to multi-year lows during the latter half. Headline inflation continued to soften and touched historic lows of around 0.25% in October. This sharper-than-expected disinflation was primarily driven by a correction in food prices.RBI has cumulatively cut the repo rate by 1.25% this year, down from 6.5% to 5.25%. The move reflected a balanced approach between supporting growth and managing inflation, aided by a favourable outlook for both headline and core inflation.India’s external position continues to display considerable strength. Supported by healthy growth in services exports and a steady rise in overseas remittances, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.3% of GDP in the second quarter of FY 2025–26, down from 2.2% in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the government release said.Remittance inflows rose by 10.7% year-on-year during the quarter, reinforcing external stability. With services exports maintaining momentum and remittance flows remaining strong, the CAD is expected to stay contained through 2025–26.“India’s growth outlook remains buoyant, with global and domestic institutions upgrading their assessments on the back of strong economic fundamentals. Reflecting broad-based momentum across key sectors, the Reserve Bank of India revised its GDP growth projection for FY 2025–26 upward from 6.8% to 7.3%,” the review said.","India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now.

"Smelling of liquor, AI pilot detained at Vancouver airport on X'mas eve before operating Delhi flight",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smelling-of-liquor-ai-pilot-detained-at-vancouver-airport-on-xmas-eve-before-operating-delhi-flight/articleshow/126281228.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content.

What the agreement says

Why the annual exchange matters

Historical context

Limits of the agreement

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad. The agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126285389,imgsize-1364220,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Canada has told Air India that one of its pilots was found tipsy just before operating a flight on Dec 23, 2025, violating the country's laws, and that the airline should investigate the case and inform it of action taken by Jan 26, 2026.Transport Canada sent this communication to AI a day after the pilot failed the breathalyser (BA) test and asked it to take ""corrective action"" under its safety management system ""to prevent any such recurrence"". This was first reported by TOI on Jan 1.Taking a serious view of the matter, AI has sought details of the BA test from Canada, including the level of alcohol found in the test, and has informed DGCA.""We were advised by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that Captain *** reported for duty on Air India Fight AI 186 on Dec 23, 2025, while under the influence of alcohol, and unfit for duty. Two BA tests conducted by the RCMP at Vancouver International Airport confirmed this after he was advised to leave the aircraft. This incident indicates a contravention of Canadian Aviation Regulations by the operator (AI) and the crew member. .. as well as conditions outlined in Air India's Foreign Air Operator Certificate (FAOC 1946) issued by Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA). It is likely that enforcement action will be pursued by the RCMP, and by TCCA,"" says a Dec 24 letter from Transport Canada to AI.One of the conditions in AI's FAOC violated is that ""foreign air operator shall conduct a safe operation"". The letter adds: “In light of this, we request Air India to: conduct a thorough review and investigation under your safety management system and p rovide details of corrective actions taken to prevent any such recurrence. Please submit your response by Jan 26, 2026, outlining your findings and measures implemented and/or undertaken,” it adds.Due to closure of Pakistan airspace after Operation Sindoor, AI North America ultra long hauls now make a midway fuelling stop. AI 186 was to be operated by two sets of pilots - a captain and co-pilot in each set - from Vancouver to Vienna. From the Austrian capital, another set would have flown it to Delhi.""This pilot, who had a layover in Vienna, was reportedly buying alcohol from Vancouver Duty Free... The pilot was boarding from Canada and alighting in Austria, both foreign stations where most probably no BA checks would have been conducted. However a staffer at duty free smelt alcohol on his breath and informed police. Using CCTV, the police traced him to the AI flight ,"" said sources.Pilots don't have alcohol at least 12 hours before flying. ""In case someone has not been able to do so, they should refuse to operate a flight on medical grounds. Refusing the flight will save your job, your licence, and your career,"" said a senior captain.In a statement on Wednesday, AI had said: ""AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025 experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot's fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry.""""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations.

"'Industrialist' scripts Rs 6,200 crore swindle with 60 shell firms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/industrialist-scripts-rs-6200-crore-swindle-with-60-shell-firms/articleshow/126278759.cms,"Enforcement Directorate

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata-based businessman weaved a web of 60 shell companies with drivers, house-keeping staff, office boys, junior staff and relatives as directors and created a fictitious turnover of thousands of crores in iron & steel manufacturing, all on paper with no real business activity involved, and swindled a consortium of govt banks of more than Rs 6,200 crore, with the head of one of the lead banks playing accessory.The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities and with the help of S K Goel, then CMD of Uco Bank, managed to get loans of Rs 6,200 crore. ""Against loans of over Rs 6,200 crore, the company's liquidation value barely reached Rs 600 crore, and assets sold so far have realised only Rs 434 crore,"" ED has said in its investigation report.The entire operation was unearthed with Goel's arrest by ED on May 16 at his residence in New Delhi. The agency later identified properties worth over Rs 106 crore associated with family members and aides and attached them. Sureka and his associates were arrested in Dec 2024, as the agency started probing money laundering based on a CBI FIR against them.According to an ED investigation report, at the centre of this scam was Concast Steel & Power Ltd (CSPL) - once a flagship iron & steel group with plants across West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh - which was taken over by Sureka in 2008.Sureka conjured up the shell entities and with the help of Goel, who served as CMD of Uco Bank between 2007-2010, managed to get a total of Rs 6,200 crore in loans without interest and penalty.This money was laundered by the accused and quid pro quo to Goel was transferred in the name of shell companies that purchased properties on the bank CMD's behalf with the ownership of these firms later being transferred to Goel's family members.""It is a case study in how an entire financial ecosystem can be manipulated through fake turnover, circular transactions and system-wide blind spots, ultimately leaving public sector banks poorer by more than Rs 6,210.7 crore, excluding interest,"" a senior official said.The official further said 60 shell companies sprang up under the directorship of drivers, office boys and junior staff to help Sureka justify massive flows of funds.ED's investigation unearthed fake sales, purchases and transport billings where CSPL ""pretended to buy and sell iron and steel products"" with associated entities, backed by forged invoices, ledger entries, and transport documents. ""Fake transportation receipts were prepared to show trucks carrying goods between factories and shell companies, even though no truck ever moved, no goods were loaded, and no delivery was made. Yet on paper, CSPL looked like a bustling, high-volume operation with continuous production and sales,"" a source said.The probe further revealed that neither sale proceeds nor payments for purchases were made through banks, 99% of the transactions were merely book entries. Yet, during the entire operation lasting several years, it did not raise any alarm bells in the banks, which continued lending.""This meant Concast was essentially selling to itself and then realising these payments through accounting fiction. By 2017, the deception hit its peak - 99% of all sales to these entities were settled through book adjustments, not a single real rupee flowed in through the banking system,"" sources said.Purchases tell the same story. Over 50% of all raw material sourcing came from the same web of related-party entities. And just like sales, almost 90% of payments to these ""suppliers"" were made through internal adjustments - no real cash outflow, no genuine material movement, just rotating entries to manufacture expenses, inflate working capital needs, and justify massive fund withdrawals, the probe report said.","The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities. With the help of S K Goel, then CMD of Uco Bank, Sureka managed to get loans of Rs 6,200 crore.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached a United Kingdom-based high-value property located near Buckingham Palace in a Rs 1,400 crore bank fraud case, the agency said on Wednesday.The property, valued at approximately Rs 150 crore, is being held under the beneficial ownership of businessman Nitin Shambhukumar Kasliwal and his family members. Kasliwal, former Chairman and Managing Director of S Kumars Nationwide Limited, is accused of defrauding a consortium of Indian banks by Rs 1,400 crore, according to multiple First Information Reports.ED's Indore sub-zonal office issued the Provisional Attachment Order (PAO) on December 30, 2025, to attach the high-value property.The move comes a week after the ED, during the course of investigation, conducted searches under section 17 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, on December 23 and seized various incriminating records along with digital devices in the case.Officials in the ED said a detailed analysis of the seized material revealed that ""Kasliwal had established a complex network of trusts and companies in multiple offshore tax havens, including the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Jersey, and Switzerland.""""The investigation uncovered that Nitin Kasliwal had set up a trust named Catherine Trust (formerly Surya Trust), in which he and his family members were the primary beneficiaries.

NEW DELHI: Medical aspirants seeking postgraduate admissions will get a wider choice this year after the National Medical Commission (NMC) approved 171 additional PG seats across medical colleges and directed counselling authorities to include them without waiting for formal permissions.According to a public notice, the 171 additional seats span key clinical and diagnostic specialties, including general medicine, general surgery, anaesthesiology, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, radiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, psychiatry, orthopaedics, respiratory medicine and pathology.Colleges across multiple states - including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Odisha, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Haryana - have received additional seats under the appeal process.In a notice issued on Dec 31, 2025, NMC's Medical Assessment and Rating Board said postgraduate seats granted by the First Appeal Committee for the 2025-26 academic year will be treated as valid for the counselling process. Counselling authorities have been told they need not wait for letters of permission (LoPs) from individual institutions to proceed.The additional seats were approved after medical colleges challenged earlier MARB decisions under provisions of NMC Act, 2019.These appeals were examined by the First Appeal Committee in meetings held on Dec 22 and 23, following which extra seats were sanctioned.The commission clarified that the list uploaded on the NMC website would itself serve as the valid document for counselling, ensuring that eligible PG seats are not lost due to administrative delays. Formal LoPs for the newly sanctioned seats, it said, will be issued shortly.Officials said the move is aimed at maximising seat utilisation while retaining regulatory oversight through the appeal mechanism. State medical education departments and counselling authorities have been instructed to act on the decision immediately.For thousands of PG aspirants, the approval offers additional opportunities at a time when competition for postgraduate medical seats remains intense.","The National Medical Commission (NMC) approved 171 additional PG seats across medical colleges.

Where Tigers Get Caught Between Faith And Tourism | I Witness

Testing human tolerance

In early 2025, a motion-sensor camera high on the hills of Purulia district, West Bengal, blinked to life. The image it captured was unremarkable in isolation: the grainy silhouette of a tiger crossing scrubland. But for residents and forest officials, it was extraordinary. Purulia had never yielded a tiger sighting before. No camera traps, no spoor, no local memory of the big cat. The photograph was more than a record; it was a signal - that the landscape had begun to shift in ways people were only beginning to comprehend.Within weeks, researchers traced the animal's path through a series of camera traps: March 2024 in Chhattisgarh's Balrampur forest division; summer sightings in Jharkhand's Palamau Tiger Reserve; and by January 2025, in Bengal's Purulia and Jhargram. The tiger had wandered roughly 500 km through human-dominated terrain, crossing administrative and ecological boundaries in search of space.The tiger's journey is not an anomaly. It is part of a pattern. India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate - almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population. This rebound, often hailed as a conservation landmark, is the centrepiece of Project Tiger's story.Conservationists and forest staff took pride in the numbers, even as they now grapple with the consequences of unprecedented success.Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimate that nearly 30% of these 3,682 tigers - more than 1,100 animals - now roam outside notified tiger reserves, sharpening the challenge of coexistence. WII director GS Bhardwaj told TOI that a dedicated Tiger Outside Tiger Reserves (TOTR) project has already been initiated from 2025, with the focus on conserving both tigers and people. The project targets forest divisions that host dispersing tigers, aims to mitigate human-tiger conflict linked to TOTR, and envisages strengthening protection regimes beyond reserve boundaries.But there is a paradox embedded in that success: Project Tiger became ""a little too successful"", as an expert said. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes, fuelled by instinct, not intention. Tigers are inherently territorial; adults typically range across tens to hundreds of square km depending on prey and habitat. Studies in Indian landscapes have shown female home ranges between 30 and 64 sq km, with males sometimes exceeding 170 sq km. The average, even in prey-rich forests, often approaches 90 sq km.Bhardwaj said WII has advised all states to strengthen wildlife protection outside tiger reserves and carry out intensive monitoring of tigers moving beyond them, so that encounters do not escalate into human casualties or retaliatory killings.In the central Indian landscape - the broad swath of forests, hills and plateaus that includes Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and surrounding states - pressure is particularly acute. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, for instance, has one of the highest tiger densities in the country. A state-level review found territorial fights to be a major cause of death among tigers there between 2021 and 2023, reflecting intense competition for space and mates. With older males holding core territories, younger animals are pushed into buffer zones and near villages, raising the frequency of conflict. Bandhavgarh registers more than 2,000 cattle kills annually - a stark indicator of how tigers are pressed against the edges of ecological and social boundaries.Not all reserves exhibit the same degree of crowding though. In Uttarakhand, Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves are approaching saturation, but nearly half of India's reserves remain below what scientists describe as their ecological capacity. Forest officials in the state have reported that Corbett can support about 20 tigers per 100 sq km, while eastern Rajaji's capacity is around 14 per 100 sq km - figures that help explain why animals increasingly stray outside protected areas.As tigers move beyond core forests, their presence ripples through local communities in palpable ways. In early 2025, in several villages in Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit region, a prowling tiger caused schools to be closed. Children stayed home. ""Exams are coming,"" said a Class 5 student from Khalispur had then said, ""but we haven't even completed the syllabus."" Teachers refused to hold evening sessions. Parents stopped letting children walk alone. Tigers in Pilibhit often establish temporary bases in sugarcane fields, drawn by wild boars that feed on the sweet crop. Boars attract tigers. Sugarcane draws both. And between them lies the village.Elsewhere, the consequences have turned fatal. In Gadchiroli district of eastern Maharashtra, tiger numbers grew from zero to nearly 30 in five years - a startling shift in a landscape long considered tiger-scarce. With 12,000 sq km of forest, it appears generous on paper. But in practice, only about 7,000 sq km in two forest divisions is occupied. Human settlements, encroachments, and patchy prey base have constrained the actual carrying capacity. In 2024, 25 villagers died in tiger attacks across the Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions. Two problem tigers were captured. A tigress was spared because she had cubs. Though technically capable of holding far more - by some estimates, up to 300 tigers - Gadchiroli cannot even accommodate 25 without triggering conflict.In one forest-fringe home in Jharkhand, a tiger entered a family's hut, settled on a wooden cot, and waited. The family, stunned, watched in silence from a corner of the room. The tiger had wandered far from mapped territory. Its entry was a mistake. Its departure, hours later, was quiet. Nobody was hurt. The event became a story of awe and fear.These tigers are no longer sentinels of wilderness. They are migrants. Monarchs in exile. Each one a ghost of ecological success, walking into fields, hamlets and homes - not out of aggression, but because the forests behind them are full.In some landscapes, officials speak of ""social carrying capacity"" - not how many tigers the habitat can sustain, but how many human communities are willing to tolerate. In parts of Uttarakhand, tiger-inflicted fatalities have surpassed leopard attacks for the first time in years. In response, village volunteers called Bagh Mitras have been trained to monitor tiger movement and alert forest departments. Some report sightings through mobile apps. Others simply listen for silence - the kind that descends before a tiger appears.Translocation - moving tigers from dense parks to underpopulated reserves - has been tried. Odisha attempted it in 2018, without success. Intra-state efforts show more promise, but officials now lean toward corridor consolidation. Movement is safer when it's natural. But for that, corridors must exist - not just on policy maps, but on the ground.In the Terai Arc, at least 10 critical corridors are under threat from habitat loss and development. In central India, linear infrastructure - railways, highways, power lines - cuts across migration routes. And yet, some reserves offer hope. In Tadoba, tiger density rose 30% over a decade, with buffer populations expanding as prey base improved. In Sundarbans, the reserve is being expanded by more than 1,000 sq km to create space for 101 tigers now crowding its mangrove heartland.India now has more than 50 tiger reserves. Some are full. Others still hold ecological potential, if prey can be restored. The key lies not just in creating new habitat, but in connecting the old - allowing dispersing tigers to move without triggering conflict.Perhaps the tiger today is not just an emblem of wilderness, but a kind of refugee of success - displaced by recovery. The Purulia tiger's trek is both a biometric trail and a metaphor. It is the story of a tiger with nowhere to go, walking east until the land gave way to politics and fear.In the empty classrooms of Pilibhit, in the living room of a Jharkhand family, in the cattle sheds of Bandhavgarh, and in the forests of Gadchiroli now marked by claw and memory, India's national animal is no longer confined to the forest. The tiger has returned. The question is - where can it stay?","India's wild tiger population has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate.

A reset born of compulsion

Impact on Indian foreign policy

What next

NEW DELHI: As India reopens channels with China, five years after the violent Galwan Valley clash, the moment carries an irony difficult to ignore. The last time an Indian prime minister trusted China, what followed has been echoing in our ears, at least for the past decade.In 2025, India–China relations have taken an unexpected turn. After years of diplomatic frost, military standoffs, and hardened rhetoric, both sides have stepped back from the edge, at least on the surface. High-level engagements resumed, including Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit to Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. Talks on disengagement at sensitive friction points such as Depsang and Demchok were revived, commercial flights were restored, and limited trade channels reopened, catching many observers off guard.For a relationship long defined by suspicion, this thaw has raised as many questions as it has hopes.India–China ties are rooted in a long and uneasy history: the trauma of the 1962 war, recurring border confrontations, the Doklam standoff, and the prolonged deadlock following the Galwan clash of 2020. Against this backdrop, the question arises: how stable is this new calm, and what does it truly rest on?Just as important is what lies behind this shift. Strategic compulsions, economic pressures, and changing global alignments appear to have nudged both capitals towards a phase of managed stability, reset driven less by reconciliation than by necessity.For India, the sudden outreach to China marked a rare recalibration of posture. After years of projecting firmness and strategic distance, New Delhi’s decision to test a reset challenged long-held assumptions about Beijing. It signalled not abandonment of caution, but a willingness to probe whether limited cooperation could coexist with enduring rivalry, without compromising strategic autonomy or long-term security interests.The 2025 reset unlocked channels that had remained frozen by mistrust since 2020. Direct passenger flights between major cities, including Delhi and Beijing, resumed after a five-year pause, restoring people-to-people contact and easing business travel that had effectively stalled since the Galwan clash.On the ground, border trade routes also saw movement. Nathu La in Sikkim reopened, allowing the exchange of local goods. These measures helped lift bilateral trade, supported by a gradual easing of restrictions on select shipments and licensing procedures.Diplomatically, both sides revived long-dormant mechanisms, from special envoys to working groups on boundary issues, creating channels to manage friction without escalating tensions. While none of these steps amounted to a breakthrough on the core border dispute, they helped restore a minimum level of predictability to a relationship that had become dangerously brittle.India’s exports to China jumped sharply in November 2025, rising 90% year-on-year to $2.2 billion, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). From April to November, exports climbed 33% to $12.2 billion. At first glance, the figures suggested a revival in commercial ties after years of disruption.But the headline numbers conceal deeper vulnerabilities.GTRI notes that India’s export growth to China remains narrow and volatile, driven largely by a handful of products rather than a broad-based expansion of India’s traditional export basket. Naphtha and select electronics dominated the surge, while sectors such as iron ore and agriculture showed inconsistent or muted performance.At the same time, India’s imports from China remain heavily concentrated and structurally entrenched. Between January and October 2025, electronics alone accounted for $38 billion in imports, followed by machinery at $25.9 billion, organic chemicals at $11.5 billion, and plastics at $6.3 billion. These categories include mobile phone components, integrated circuits, laptops, solar modules, lithium-ion batteries, and pharmaceutical intermediates.The result is a widening trade imbalance. India’s exports to China fell from $23 billion in 2021 to $15.2 billion in 2022, remained subdued through 2023, and are projected to rise modestly to $17.5 billion in 2025. Imports, however, surged from $87.7 billion in 2021 to an estimated $123.5 billion in 2025, pushing the trade deficit towards $106 billion.Chinese customs data paints an even starker picture, suggesting a deficit of over $115 billion.India’s recent export gains to China are narrow, volatile, and heavily dependent on shifts in Chinese demand, GTRI warns. Without a sustained strategy to expand competitive manufacturing and reduce import dependence, short-term spikes will not alter the fundamentally imbalanced nature of the relationship.Many analysts argue that the 2025 thaw was driven less by renewed trust and more by shared constraints. As Ashley Tellis put it in one of his articles, “The India–China detente is more tactical than transformative, driven by US tariff pressures and trade deficits, not genuine border resolution.”For Beijing, mounting pressure from renewed US tariffs under President Donald Trump, a slowing domestic economy, and widening Western efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains made engagement with India increasingly attractive. Stabilising ties with a major regional power offered China economic breathing space and diplomatic signalling at a time of global pushback.For New Delhi, the calculus was equally pragmatic. Prolonged military deployments along the Line of Actual Control strained resources and readiness, while global supply chain disruptions underscored the costs of sustained confrontation with the world’s manufacturing hub. De-escalation offered room to regroup without conceding core positions.What emerged was a carefully calibrated detente, transactional, limited, and hedged, designed to manage risk rather than resolve rivalry.The durability of the 2025 reset remains uncertain. There is still no agreed demarcation of the Line of Actual Control, and troop levels have not returned to pre-2020 positions. Even minor patrol incidents could quickly spiral into larger crises.Deeper political sensitivities remain unresolved. The presence of the Dalai Lama in India and Beijing’s concerns over succession continue to loom in the background. China’s strategic partnership with Pakistan, particularly in the aftermath of terror incidents such as the Pahalgam attack, remains a major source of friction.Former Indian ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale told DW, “Beijing knows this. So does New Delhi. For example, India is never going to permit Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE into India’s telecom space again.”Without clearer ground rules and deeper strategic dialogue, many fear the thaw could remain temporary, vulnerable to the next shock.Opinions differ on whether India’s outreach to China reflects tensions with the United States or a broader recalibration. Beijing also recently rejected claims in a Pentagon report that China is easing border tensions to weaken US–India ties, calling such assertions misleading.For India, engagement with China fits a long-standing strategy of hedging, keeping options open, protecting strategic autonomy, and avoiding over-reliance on any one power. Strategic analyst Happymon Jacob, in an article, argued that the renewed bonhomie demonstrates that alternatives to exclusive alignment with Washington do exist.The reset has also improved India’s footing in multilateral forums such as the SCO and BRICS. With tensions temporarily eased, New Delhi will be able to engage more confidently, leveraging improved optics with Xi Jinping to press Global South concerns, development financing, and calls for a more balanced global order.At the same time, India can quietly continue to strengthen its neighbourhood strategy, deepening ties with Bhutan, expanding connectivity initiatives, and countering Chinese influence in Nepal and Sri Lanka.India now finds itself at a familiar but delicate crossroads. Over the past decade, it has sought to position itself as a central player in a multipolar world, balancing ties with the US and Russia while managing competition with China. This balancing act has become harder as global fault lines sharpen, forcing New Delhi to constantly reassess risks without locking itself into rigid alliances.Strategic analyst Brahma Chellaney, in an article, cautioned against overconfidence, warning that past experience shows how quickly tactical accommodation with China can unravel. History suggests that periods of calm in India–China relations often rest on fragile assumptions, vulnerable to sudden shifts triggered by border incidents, regional crises, or domestic political pressures on either side.Going forward, New Delhi will have to walk a tightrope. Military vigilance along the LAC cannot be relaxed even as diplomatic engagement continues. Economically, India must accelerate efforts to reduce critical import dependence, especially in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and clean energy components, while ensuring trade engagement does not translate into strategic vulnerability.The challenge ahead will be to preserve this fragile equilibrium: securing short-term stability without sacrificing long-term security, avoiding economic over-dependence, and ensuring that tactical resets do not harden into strategic illusions. For now, the 2025 thaw offers space, but not certainty.","After years of diplomatic frost, military standoffs, and hardened rhetoric, both sides have stepped back from the edge, at least on the surface. High-level engagements resumed, including Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit to Delhi. Direct passenger flights between major cities, including Delhi and Beijing, resumed after a five-year pause.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126274153,imgsize-1066609,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-5.jpg"
India’s largest BOT highway project gets Cabinet nod; Surat–Chennai travel time to drop 45%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-largest-bot-highway-project-gets-cabinet-nod-suratchennai-travel-time-to-drop-45/articleshow/126275834.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Wednesday approved the construction of the 374-km greenfield access-controlled Nashik-Solapur-Akkalkot highway in Maharashtra, which is part of the Surat-Chennai high-speed corridor, at an estimated cost of Rs 19,142 crore.This will be the largest value of highway project on Build, Operate, Transfer (BOT) mode in the country’s NH development history, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.The cabinet also approved widening and strengthening of the 206-km Mohana to Koraput stretch of NH-326 in Odisha with an estimated cost of Rs 1,526 crore, which will improve connectivity to major economic and logistics corridors, and better last-mile access to Gopalpur port and Jeypore airport.PM Narendra Modi termed the decision of greenfield highway in Maharashtra as “building next-generation infrastructure development”. On X, he said, “This transformative project, aligned with PM Gati Shakti, will significantly reduce travel time, strengthen west-east connectivity, boost logistics cost, and create large-scale employment.” An official said this will emerge as an alternative to the existing Mumbai-Chennai corridor.Vaishnaw told reporters that the corridor will reduce travel time between Nashik and Solapur due to reduction in distance and allowing vehicles to drive at higher speed. The project will be completed in two years from the date of start of work. “Because of this corridor, the travel time between Surat and Chennai will be reduced by 45% from 31 hours at present to 17 hours. This will facilitate heavy traffic between Surat, Vadodara and Mumbai towards Kurnool, Bengaluru and Chennai,” he added.The project will be developed in two large packages of 152 km (Nashik to Ahilyanagar) and 222 km (Ahilyanagar to Akkalkot). The traffic estimate for this corridor is projected around 39,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day. TOI has learnt that while for the first package, the govt may have to provide viability gap funding of around Rs 495 crore, the NHAI is likely to get annual premium from successful private highway builders.Responding to questions on how the massive project can be completed in just two years, officials said that the project will be bid out after getting 90% land and obtaining all approvals. “The land acquisition is at an advanced stage for the entire project,” said an official.","The 374-km greenfield access-controlled Nashik-Solapur-Akkalkot highway is part of the Surat-Chennai high-speed corridor.

South Haryana districts like Gurgaon showed significant lag in SRB

GURUGRAM: Haryana's annual sex ratio at birth (SRB), the number of girls born per 1,000 boys, climbed to 923 in 2025, the first time it has showed a gain since 2019.Alarm bells rang last year after it fell to 910, its lowest since 2016 when the 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' campaign was launched as a social campaign in a state with one of the lowest sex ratios in the country because of female infanticide.According to Civil Registration System (provisional) figures, the state registered 5,19,691 births last year, of which 2,70,281 were boys and 2,49,410 girls. Three districts reported an SRB of 950 or above, with Panchkula leading the state at 971, followed by Fatehabad (961) and Panipat (951).Karnal (944) and Yamunanagar (943) complete the top five. Sirsa (937), Nuh (935), Kurukshetra (927), Ambala (926), Hisar (926), Bhiwani (926) and Kaithal (924) were also above the state average.Health officials attributed the improvement to a series of crackdowns through 2025 against sex-selective abortions and sale of illegal medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) kits. An SRB of 923 is still low compared to other states but it's the highest Haryana has achieved. Over the years, the annual average has fluctuated, rather than held steady.South Haryana districts around Delhi, including Gurgaon (901), showed significant lag.Faridabad (916), Rohtak (898) and Sonipat (894) were among the weakest performers. Rewari (882) was placed at the bottom.Panchkula saw the most notable long-term improvement, from 909 in 2015 to 971 in 2025, despite dips in between, including a fall to 915 in 2024. Fatehabad, which was at 893 in 2015, climbed to 961 last year as did Panipat, which was at 892 in 2015. Gurgaon, despite its weaker performance compared to these districts, also saw an improvement from 858 in 2015.After the fall in SRB in 2024, a state-level task force was set up in March, with officers from health department, police, women and child development, AYUSH, National Health Mission (NHM) and the Food and Drug Administration reviewing SRB weekly.""A total of 114 FIRs were registered under MTP Act and 16 under PCPNDT (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act in 2025. Ultrasound inspections nearly doubled from 3,072 in 2024 to 5,836 in 2025. Reverse tracking of abortions beyond 12 weeks among women with previous girl children was a key tool. From Oct 2024 to Dec 2025, 3,292 such abortions were reported through Asha workers, leading to 68 FIRs against clinics, chemists, peddlers and middlemen,"" said Dr Virender Yadav, director of NHM, Haryana.Crackdowns on abortion kit sales intensified. FDA sealed 44 chemist shops last year and registered 59 FIRs, including 17 for online sales. More than 6,000 kits were seized. The number of abortions carried out beyond 10 weeks fell from 21,498 in 2024 to 14,204 in 2025. A total of 495 of the state's 1,500 registered MTP centres were shut for violations.","Haryana's annual sex ratio at birth climbs to 923 in 2025.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

Vanishing buffer

BENGALURU: Following a dispute mirroring the Aravalli controversy, members of a Supreme Court-appointed panel will inspect Bannerghatta National Park Friday after a plea against a 2018 govt move to cut the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Bengaluru's green backyard.The park is facing pressure from mining and real estate interests eyeing its contiguous landscape. At the core of the standoff is govt's move to drastically shrink ESZ from 268.9sqkm to 168.8sqkm and curtail its width from 4km to just 1km.A group of citizens and activists led by K Belliappa had approached Supreme Court in May 2025, arguing the reduction undermines the purpose of an ESZ. On Friday, members of the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC), led by Chandra Prakash Goyal, will survey the park and speak to senior Karnataka officials, including the chief secretary, to assess the ecological impact of the reduction.In a preliminary notification in June 2016, the Union environment ministry had in consultation with the state proposed declaring 268.9sqkm around BNP as ESZ. However, the final notification of Nov 2018 sharply curtailed the protected area - a decision the petitioners alleged was influenced by real estate developers and mining and quarrying interests. They contended that several ecologically sensitive pockets surrounding well-documented elephant corridors were excluded from the final notification.Kiran Urs, a member of the Bannerghatta Nature Conservation Trust (BNCT), said ESZ reduction appeared to be an attempt to legitimise existing ecological violations. ""The pockets excluded from the final notification contain active quarries, and there were efforts to build a township along the boundary, which will inevitably exert immense pressure on the ecosystem,"" Urs alleged.Somashekhar, a farmer from Kaduchikkanahalli near the park, claimed he came under pressure to sell his land even after the final ESZ notification. ""However, I continue to hold my land and grow ragi,"" he said. Keerthan Reddy of BNCT described the park as one of the best ecological gifts for a burgeoning Bengaluru. ""No other city can boast this vast green landscape in its backyard, dotted with a salubrious population of tigers, elephants, leopards, and countless other species of flora and fauna. The city is already witness to rising incidents of human-animal conflict, and violations like these would only add to the problem,"" Reddy cautioned.",Supreme Court-appointed panel will inspect Bannerghatta National Park Friday.

NEW DELHI: Nearly four out of every 10 sanctioned faculty posts remain vacant across 11 AIIMS, exposing a deep staffing crunch at India's premier public hospitals even as patient loads continue to rise. RTI replies accessed by TOI show that 1,600 of 4,099 faculty positions - about 39% - are lying vacant, raising concerns about the impact on patient care, specialist services and medical education.The data, compiled from RTI responses received from 11 All India Institute of Medical Sciences across different states, point to a widespread shortage cutting across both older, established AIIMS and newer institutes.At AIIMS Delhi - the country's oldest and largest AIIMS and a national referral centre for complex cases - 524 faculty posts are vacant out of a sanctioned strength of 1,306, across key departments such as medicine, surgery, anaesthesia, paediatrics, neurology, oncology and emergency care.Several newer AIIMS are facing even higher shortages. AIIMS Jodhpur is worst hit, operating with 46.7% of faculty posts vacant (189 of 405).AIIMS Gorakhpur follows with 45.5% vacancies, while AIIMS Jammu reports a 44.3% shortfall. More than 40% of posts are also unfilled at AIIMS Kalyani and AIIMS Bilaspur. AIIMS Nagpur has 137 vacant posts out of 373 sanctioned positions, amounting to 36.7% vacancies.Other institutes show relatively lower - but still significant - shortages. AIIMS Bathinda is short of 37.4% of its faculty strength, AIIMS Raipur 34.8%, AIIMS Bhubaneswar 26%, and AIIMS Bhopal 25.6%.Health experts warn that prolonged faculty shortages at teaching hospitals affect outpatient services, surgery schedules, ICU supervision and the training of undergraduate and postgraduate doctors, as senior faculty juggle clinical, academic and administrative roles.Responding to staffing concerns, Rima Dada, media cell in-charge at AIIMS Delhi, said recruitment efforts were ongoing.

Rajnath Singh Links Lord Ram's Ethics To Operation Sindoor, Says India Fought Terror With Dignity

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday that the “weapon systems developed by DRDO played a decisive role during Operation Sindoor , which serves as a testament to the professionalism and commitment of the organisation towards safeguarding national interests”. He also exuded confidence that DRDO will play a crucial role in the creation of anti-missile defence system ‘Sudarshan Chakra’, as announced by PM Narendra Modi during his independence day address in 2025.During his visit to the DRDO headquarters here on the agency’s 68th foundation day, the minister commended DRDO for bolstering India’s indigenous capabilities by equipping the armed forces with state-of-the-art technologies, and said the agency’s equipment worked seamlessly during Operation Sindoor, boosting the morale of soldiers.Learning lessons from the Pakistan conflict last year, when enemy forces launched an array of missiles and drones on India, the country is now developing a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence system ‘Sudarshan Chakra’ to create a comprehensive security shield against diverse threats like ballistic missiles, drones, and hypersonic weapons. “Under this initiative, DRDO is responsible for equipping our vital installations with an air defence system to ensure complete aerial protection over the next decade.We witnessed the importance of air defence in modern warfare during Operation Sindoor. I am confident that DRDO will work wholeheartedly to achieve this goal soon,” Singh said.The minister praised DRDO for becoming trust builders along with technology creators, which makes people look towards it with hope, certainty, and belief. Acknowledging DRDO’s collaboration with the private sector, he said the increased engagement with the industry, academia and start-ups has resulted in the creation of a synergetic defence ecosystem. “DRDO has consistently improved its systems, processes, and working methods. From procurement to project management, from industry engagement to collaborating with start-ups and MSMEs, there is a visible effort to make the work easier, faster, and more reliable,” he said.Singh said, “The world is changing every day. Technology, innovation and new warfare domains are rapidly advancing, making yesterday’s knowledge obsolete. We must never assume that the learning process has ended. We must continue learning and challenge themselves, paving the way for the new generation.”He was apprised of the major targets set for 2026 and various reforms that the DRDO is taking for the betterment of the organisation.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh visited the DRDO headquarters on its 68th foundation day.

AI Is Helping Farmers Cut Costs, Increase Income | I Witness

Union fertilizers minister J P Nadda on Thursday inaugurated an integrated e-bill system aimed at digitally processing fertilizer subsidies of about Rs 2 lakh crore. The move replaces manual, paper-based procedures with a fully digital workflow, eliminating the physical movement of bills, an official statement said.""This online system will play a significant role in strengthening transparent, efficient and technology-driven governance,"" Nadda said at the launch event, as cited by PTI.The initiative is a key outcome of a technological collaboration between the Department of Fertilizers’ Integrated Financial Management System (iFMS) and the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) of the controller general of accounts under the ministry of finance.The transformation ""significantly enhances transparency and accountability by creating a centralised and tamper-proof digital audit trail for all financial transactions, thereby facilitating easier monitoring and audits,"" said CGA Santosh Kumar.The e-bill platform allows fertilizer companies to submit subsidy claims online and monitor payment status in real time, removing the need for physical visits and manual follow-ups.It introduces a standardised electronic workflow, including first-in-first-out bill processing, to ensure consistency and adherence to financial rules.The system offers real-time oversight of expenditure and stronger financial controls, with all payments tracked and reported through a central platform.Manoj Sethi, joint secretary in the fertilizers ministry, said the system “enables end-to-end digital bill processing, which will significantly accelerate payment timelines, including timely release of weekly fertilizer subsidy payments”.The system also incorporates robust internal controls that validate payments against predefined criteria, record every action for audit purposes, and help reduce the risk of fraud.The event was attended by additional secretaries Aneeta C Meshram and Aparna Sharma, joint secretaries K K Pathak and Anurag Rohatagi, and director Laboni Das Datta.Senior Technical Director Aseem Gupta of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) outlined the technical features and architecture of the system.The implementation and demonstration were supported by the NIC team, including joint director Ashutosh Tiwari and developer Harekrishna Tiwari, whose efforts in building and rolling out the platform were widely appreciated.","Union fertilizers minister J P Nadda on Thursday inaugurated an integrated e-bill system aimed at digitally processing fertilizer subsidies of about Rs 2 lakh crore.

Nights will, however, be colder in the entire region during the month, leading to fog formation on many days.IMD also predicted “normal to above normal” rainfall across “most parts” of the country, which is conducive for the standing Rabi (winter sown) crops.Though Punjab, Haryana and other parts of northwest India are likely to get ‘below normal’ showers, it won’t impact the farming operations there due to a fairly good irrigation network and water storage facilities in the region.Releasing the annual climate summary for 2025, director general of the IMD, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, said the year with recording 0.28 degree Celsius higher than the long-term (1991-2020) average temperature turned out to be “eighth warmest year” since nationwide temperature records began in the country in 1901.“Notably, 10 of the 15 warmest years in India have occurred during the recent 15-year period (2011-25),” he said, underlining that the year 2024 was the warmest year on record with reporting 0.65 degree C above the long-term average temperature.Last year’s winter was not as severe as what may be experienced this year. It was clearly reflected from the temperature anomaly of Jan and Feb of 2025. Feb last year recorded the “highest monthly mean temperature ever” for the country whereas Jan marked the “second highest” on record since 1901.IMD data shows the extreme weather events led to 2,763 deaths in 2025 with Uttar Pradesh recording the highest such casualties followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Bihar. Floods and heavy rains took the highest toll of 1,372 followed by lightning & thunderstorms that took 1,317 lives.As far as the global average temperature in 2025 was concerned, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) recently noted that the year is set to be either the second or third warmest year on record. So far, 2024 was the warmest year on record globally followed by 2023, the previous warmest. Both these years along with 2025 may, therefore, now be the three warmest years on record.Mohapatra attributed a virtually dry Dec 2025 to the absence of western disturbances that bring rains and thunderstorms to the northwest and central India. “The western disturbances are either moving towards north or moving too fast,” he said, attributing the change in pattern to climate change.","Year 2025 was the eighth warmest year on record in India. 2016-25 period emerged as the warmest decade, IMD said while releasing its annual climate summary on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Air quality in Delhi deteriorated on Friday, with the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded at 311, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) SAMEER app.The decline in air quality came amid chilly winter conditions in the national capital, with pollutants lingering close to the ground due to unfavourable weather.Several parts of the city reported AQI levels in the poor to very poor range, raising concerns over prolonged exposure to polluted air.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast cold wave conditions at isolated places in Delhi between January 2 and 5, a development that could further affect air quality.Low wind speeds and falling temperatures are expected to restrict the dispersal of pollutants in the coming days.","The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded at 311, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category.

Kolkata wakes up to season’s worst air as New Year fireworks push AQI into ‘very poor’ zone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-wakes-up-to-seasons-worst-air-as-new-year-fireworks-push-aqi-into-very-poor-zone/articleshow/126297528.cms,"Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness







Kolkata woke up to the foulest air of the season on the first day of the year as midnight firecracker revelry pushed pollution levels deep into ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ zones at a time when cold air tends to hold pollutants closer to breathing height. The only silver lining was the presence of a breeze that dispersed some of the pollutants and prevented the air from turning worse.While the scale of fireworks was lower than Diwali, experts said the impact was far more severe due to prevailing winter conditions. Chill causes thermal inversion, a meteorological phenomenon that traps pollutants close to the ground by restricting vertical air movement and preventing their dispersal.At noon, readings at two air-quality monitoring stations were in ‘very poor’ category (AQI 301–400) and just one level below the ‘severe’ category. The remaining five stations recorded ‘poor’ AQI ( 201–300). Jadavpur, in particular, touched AQI 314, matching pollution levels seen in Delhi at the peak of its recent smog crisis, even as the national capital showed signs of recovery. Salt Lake was not far behind with AQI of 308 while Victoria Memorial came close to breach-ing the ‘very poor’ threshold, recording an AQI of 292.Barely 24 hours ago, AQI at Jadavpur was 159 and Salt Lake 154, both in the moderate range (AQI 101-200).A scientist from West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) warned that fireworks during winter are especially dangerous. “During winter, firecracker revelry is suicidal as far as air pollution is concerned. Low ground temperature causes thermal inversion, suppressing vertical wind movement. Wind speed often drops below 2 metres per second, allowing pollutants to accumulate near the surface,” the scientist said. Experts also cautioned that recovery would be slow. With cold conditions expected to persist, pollution from successive days is likely to pile up in the lower atmosphere, worsening air quality.Environmentalists warned that repeated violations pose serious risks to public health, particularly for children, senior citizens and people with respiratory ailments, and stressed the need for stricter enforcement and greater public awareness in future celebrations.The night also witnessed rampant violations of noise pollution norms, particularly during the first hour of the New Year. Monitoring data showed noise levels breaching 80 decibels in several residential and silence zones—nearly double the permissible night-time limits.Jadavpur University, a designated silence zone, recorded noise levels as high as 84.1 dB, while Flora Fountain in a residential area touched 81.5 dB shortly after midnight. Several colleges and educational institutions, classified as silence zones, reported noise levels ranging between 70 and 80 dB. Under existing rules, the permissible night-time noise limit is 45 dB for residential areas and 40 dB for silence zones.Besides the high-decibel firecrackers, there was rampant use of loudspeakers without sound limiters and DJ music. At Madhyamram’s Deshbandhunagar, Suman Roy’s plea against the use of loudspeakers that was affecting his elderly parents, fell on deaf ears.",Kolkata woke up to the foulest air of the year as midnight firecracker revelry pushed pollution levels deep into ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ zones.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Highest packages in the last 3 years:







HYDERABAD: Amid a tough job market, a computer science engineering student from Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IITH), has landed a Rs 2.5 crore package from a Netherlands-based firm in this year's placements. According to IITH, this is the highest package ever bagged by a student in the history of the institution, which started in 2008.Edward Nathan Varghese, a final-year student, will begin work with Optiver — a global trading firm — as software engineer from July. The 21-year-old secured the offer after converting a two-month internship into a pre-placement offer (PPO).""This was the first and only company I interviewed for. I was ecstatic when my mentor indicated that the firm would be extending me an offer. So were my parents,"" a jubilant Varghese told TOI on Wednesday. Born and raised in Hyderabad — he later studied in Bengaluru from class 7 to class 12 — Varghese said he was always confident of landing a handsome package, the slowdown in the market notwithstanding.""I knew that the IIT tag would draw companies to our campus and that the effect of the present job market would be minimal. Also, since first year of engineering, I was into competitive programming and among the top 100 in the country.That too helped me crack the interview, along with the curriculum that gave us the option to do a wide range of courses. I was lucky to get a PPO,"" said Varghese, whose parents are both engineers.While two students were selected for the internship at Optiver, Varghese alone got a PPO. The summer internship included two weeks of training and a six-week project. He will be working full-time at the firm's Netherlands office.Apart from Varghese, another CSE student at IITH walked away with a Rs 1.1 crore package — raising the bar for the institute. Until now, the highest package ever offered to an IITH student was about Rs 1 crore, recorded in 2017.But 2025 not only changed that, it also saw the average packages at the institute jump by about 75% compared to 2024 — from Rs 20.8 lakh to Rs 36.2 lakh. A total of 24 international offers were secured by students this year in the first phase of placements, which ended in Dec.""More than packages, our target is to ensure that all students who want to get placed receive a good offer. Along with tech jobs, we are also concentrating on providing good opportunities to core engineering students by giving PSUs and core engineering companies early slots,"" said Mayur Vaidya, faculty-in-charge (FiC), Office of Career Services, adding that they are constantly reaching out to more firms and highlighting their flexible calendar, diversity of courses, and curriculum to ensure more companies come to campus.Vaidya said in Phase 2 of placements, more postgraduate students are likely to receive offers from domestic companies.Currently, 196 PG students out of 650 have been placed, with an average package of Rs 22 lakh. When it comes to UG students, 62% of the 487 students who registered for placements received job offers.2025-26 – Rs 2.5 crore2024-25 – Rs 66 lakh2023-24 – Rs 90 lakh","Edward Nathan Varghese, a final-year student, will begin work with Optiver — a global trading firm — as software engineer from July.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Adobe CEO's reply to Steve Jobs





Adobe and Apple have been allies and rivals through the ages. Apple and Adobe have a long history of both agreement and opposition. They've been closely linked since the early days of desktop publishing, often with complementary product lines and common customers. But the two have also fought publicly on numerous occasions. Apple and Adobe's fight over Flash technology after Apple kinda 'banned' Flash on iPhones.Another of this Apple vs Adobe tale is Steve Jobs’ email to Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen in 2005. Bruce Chizen was Adobe's CEO from 2000 to 2007. The story goes that Steve Jobs got information on Apple employees being poached by Adobe. Jobs reportedly believed that the two companies had a total non-poaching agreement in place. So Jobs is said to have decided to cut out the middle man and went straight to the big boss with a scathing email. Below are the email exchanges between the two CEOs that were made public in court documents following a 2010 antitrust lawsuit over tech companies' supposed agreements to 'Not Cold Call' each other's employees for hiring purposes. It is against the law in the US to collude with other companies about hiring. Adobe, Apple, Google and Intel had to pay $415 million to settle the suit.On May 26, 2005, at 4:15 PM, Bruce Chizen wrote:I thought we agreed not to recruit any senior level employees (at Adobe this is Sr. Director/VP and represents about 2% of the population).

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's Gemini app has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months.

GHAZIABAD: UP govt is planning discounts of up to 25% to help clear an inventory of nearly 10,000 unsold flats built by Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and UP Housing Board in the city.The push comes through the Model Costing Guidelines Basic Principles 2025, introduced to dispose of unsold inventories of flats and plots and to standardise pricing across development authorities and housing board.There are 1,748 unsold flats built by GDA across five housing schemes.Housing board, meanwhile, has around 8,000 unsold units in Ghaziabad alone - about 4,000 in Sidharth Vihar's Ganga Yamuna and Hindon schemes and another 4,000 in the Mandola housing scheme.There was a lack of uniformity across development authorities over the costing of flats and plots.""To do away with this, UP govt introduced the guidelines. Following the cabinet's approval, principal secretary (housing and urban planning) P Guruprasad issued directions to all development authorities to implement the new guidelines,"" a GDA official said.The official said the revised costing would factor in land acquisition rates, external and internal development charges and construction cost, and is expected to lower the per unit prices by up to about 25% compared with existing rates.Apart from the 25% discount on the base price, the guidelines provide for further rebates for faster payment - 6% for a one-time payment within 45 days, 5% within 60 days and 4% within 90 days.Premium charges have also been capped more tightly. Flats and plots, such as corner units, parking facing units and those on 18-metre-wide roads, will be priced 5% higher, with the cap set at 5% against the earlier 8% to 10%, the official said. However, for all three benefits together, the maximum additional charge will not exceed 12% of the original cost. Among other features, the rate of interest on EWS and LIG flats is fixed at 8%.For GDA, where unsold stock spans categories from EWS to larger houses, the per unit cost currently ranges from Rs 5.7 lakh for EWS units to Rs 69.4 lakh across schemes offering 1, 2 and 3 BHK as well as mini LIG and LIG flats. Housing board's inventory is priced higher - a 1 BHK is listed at Rs 69.4 lakh, a 2 BHK at Rs 87 lakh and a 3 BHK at Rs 1.1 crore.","UP govt is planning discounts of up to 25% to help clear an inventory of nearly 10,000 unsold flats built by Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) and UP Housing Board in the city.

"Relief, finally: Kolkata airport mends design flaw, set to get restrooms on arrival entry level",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/relief-finally-kolkata-airport-mends-design-flaw-set-to-get-restrooms-on-arrival-entry-level/articleshow/126297951.cms,"





KOLKATA: After more than a decade of clenched jaws and frantic corridor dashes, relief is finally in sight for flyers landing in Kolkata as the city's airport is set to rectify one of its most complained-about design flaws - the absence of restrooms on the upper arrival level. This is the area where flyers enter on exiting the aerobridge.The first of three much-needed toilet blocks in the arrival corridor on the upper level, where arriving passengers alight from the aircraft to enter the domestic terminal via aerobridges, is almost ready and is set to be opened this month. Once functional, the toilet block will provide relief to exhausted passengers who currently have to scramble to the lower arrival level, past the entire length of the luggage belt and beyond, to reach the restrooms.The other two blocks will be ready by March, airport officials said.The new restrooms will address a design flaw in Kolkata airport's integrated terminal that has inconvenienced incoming passengers for a dozen years. The terminal was inaugurated in Jan 2013 and became functional in March that year.Authorities said that 90% of work is complete on one of the three pairs of toilets for women, men and the disabled at the upper arrival concourse while about 65% of work is complete for the other two facilities.The three restrooms will cater to passengers stepping into the terminal through 11 arrival gates on the upper floor - 14 to 25. On the lower arrival level, five additional toilet blocks will be set up.A frequent flyer said: ""At present, restrooms seem to take an eternity to locate for those in urgent need to relieve themselves at the end of a long flight. The new toilets will be a boon for flyers. They should have come up much earlier.""Crew restrict access to aircraft restrooms almost 20 minutes before touchdown.Though the distance between the aerobridge and the baggage conveyor belts in Kolkata is the shortest among airports in metro cities, the location of toilets is the farthest upon landing among other airports.For years, the mismatch between convenience and necessity has been a sore point for passengers landing in the city. Flyers recount anxious minutes spent speed-walking through corridors with cabin bags in tow, hoping to spot a restroom sign before discomfort turns into distress.""After two-and-a-half-hour flight from Delhi, those last 15 minutes feel endless,"" said Dwaipayan Roy, who frequently travels between the two cities.Passengers say the absence of such facilities on the upper arrival level in Kolkata has often triggered chaos and frayed tempers. ""You see people almost jogging, some elderly, some with children, all asking the same question - 'toilet kothay?'"" said Rishwav Mondal, a third-year college student.The airport is already addressing the stink and stain issue in restrooms by revamping the toilets in the terminal and then undertaking a deep cleaning of each toilet at regular intervals. The toilets are practically being demolished and fresh ones constructed with new floor and wall tiles, sanitary ware and fixtures.","The first of three much-needed toilet blocks in the arrival corridor on the upper level is almost ready.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,172.90, up 26 points or 0.10%. BSE Sensex was at 85,282.91, up 94 points or 0.11%.Indian markets are set to take cues from a combination of corporate earnings for the third quarter and global developments in the coming sessions, with analysts pointing to December-quarter results, Union Budget expectations and overseas factors such as progress on an India-US trade deal and possible US Federal Reserve actions as key influences. Earnings growth is expected to remain the primary driver of market direction through 2026.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The impressive 25.8 % YoY increase in passenger vehicles sales in December bodes well for the auto industry. More importantly, this data confirms the growth momentum in the economy. It has to be watched whether this growth sustains, albeit at a slower pace, going forward. It is hugely important that the growth momentum in the economy sustains, because that alone can ensure the much needed earnings growth that the market needs to remain resilient and gradually move up.“The positive news about the auto industry is largely in the price. A sector that lagged last year was the consumer durables industry, which has the potential to catch up, going forward. The beneficial impact of the interest rate cuts and GST cuts are yet to reflect in the demand for consumer durables. In the short-term, this is one segment that has good prospects.”Global risk sentiment was upbeat at the start of the New Year, with US equity index futures trading higher, signalling a positive opening for equities. Gains were also seen across precious metals, with gold and silver advancing in early trade.Gold edged up on Friday after touching a two-week low in the previous session, while silver and other precious metals recovered part of the losses recorded over the past week. Despite the recent pullback, the metals had logged historic gains over the course of 2025.On the institutional front, foreign portfolio investors continued to pare their exposure to Indian equities, selling shares worth Rs 3,268 crore on Wednesday.

Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE import sand from Australia despite their endless deserts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-import-sand-from-australia-despite-their-endless-deserts/articleshow/126249828.cms,"Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand to meet the demands of mega-projects like NEOM and the Burj Khalifa. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential. This reliance highlights a global sand crisis, environmental pressures, and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives and innovation in construction materials.





Why desert sand won't do





Australia's role in supplying sand





The broader Gulf context





Vision 2030 and the need for quality



A global sand crisis





Sending coals to Newcastle is a phrase from the early 16th century, describing the pointless act of bringing coal to a city that already had plenty. As ironic as it may seem, similar paradoxes play out in the real world, sometimes on a massive scale. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for instance, are importing sand from countries such as Australia, China, and Belgium, according to the OEC. While the idea of desert nations buying sand seems puzzling, the reason lies in the specifics of construction requirements. As these countries race ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects, Saudi Arabia with its Vision 2030 developments, and the UAE with its skyline-transforming towers, the demand for a specific type of sand that deserts cannot provide has led to a steady stream of imports.This lesser-known fact sheds light on a broader global issue: the growing scarcity of construction-grade sand and the paradoxes of resource dependency even in the most unlikely places.Desert landscapes like Saudi Arabia’s might be abundant in sand, but ironically not all sand is created equal. The grains found in deserts are typically too round and smooth because they have often been eroded by wind over thousands of years.This makes them poorly suited for concrete production, where angular and coarse microscopic grains are essential to form a strong, cohesive structural mix when combined with cement and water ultimately.Concrete itself has three basic components: cement, water, and aggregate, combined in slightly different proportions depending on the intended strength and use. Cement is the powdery substance that reacts with water to form a ‘glue’, binding the mixture together. Because it is made from limestone and processed at incredibly high temperatures, cement production is highly energy-intensive and releases millions of tonnes of CO₂ each year. Some estimates suggest that the global cement industry alone may be responsible for up to 8% of the world’s CO₂ emissions , highlighting its environmental footprint.Aggregate provides concrete with its bulk. Depending on the mix, it can account for between 60 and 80% of the volume of concrete and 70-85% of its weight. Yet the term ‘aggregate’ masks the true origins of this essential material: it is made from a combination of coarse gravel and fine sediment, including sand, which can make up to 45% of the aggregate by volume. Crucially, not just any sand will do—its texture and shape are decisive factors in the strength and durability of the final concrete.The type of sand required for skyscrapers, infrastructure, and urban development usually comes from riverbeds, lakes, and seabeds, environments that produce more angular grains capable of binding effectively. Most natural sand is created through the slow, continuous process of weathering across various landscapes. A glance at satellite images shows just how abundant desert sand appears to be. Yet, despite its abundance, wind-tumbled desert grains are far too smooth and small to provide the necessary structural grip. The construction sector, therefore, relies on sand from quarries and riverbeds, where water-shaped grains are naturally angular, rough, and perfectly suited for cement to adhere.As investigative journalist Vince Beiser notes in The World in a Grain, trying to make concrete with desert sand is like “trying to build something out of a stack of marbles instead of a stack of little bricks.” The nuances of sand composition may seem trivial, but they underpin the foundations of cities and economies. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the world consumes around 50 billion tonnes of sand every year, making it the most extracted solid material globally—yet only a fraction is suitable for construction purposes.Australia has emerged as one of the key exporters of high-quality silica and construction sand. As per the OEC world, in 2023, Australia exported $273M of Sand, making it the 2nd largest exporter of Sand (out of 183) in the world with Saudi Arabia among the importers. In 2023, Saudi Arabia imported about US $140,000 worth of natural construction-grade sand from Australia.Saudi Arabia’s purchase of Australian sand, notably highlights the Kingdom’s reliance on these imports to meet construction standards for large-scale mega infrastructure projects. The conversation resurfaced on social media in 2024, as the trend clearly continues in the wake of Saudi Arabia's ambitious urban development plans, including NEOM, The Red Sea Project, and Qiddiya nationwide.These projects require not just vast amounts of concrete but also the highest standards in material quality, a demand that desert sand simply cannot fulfil.Saudi Arabia isn't alone in this phenomenon regionally today. Other Gulf countries, including the UAE and Qatar, similarly face the same paradox: vast deserts, yet a long-standing reliance on imported sand for high-quality construction. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has increasingly sourced construction-grade sand from overseas to support its ongoing rapid skyline expansion, a necessity dictated by the precise structural demands of complex modern engineering.Consider the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 828 metres. Its construction required immense quantities of materials: 39,000 tonnes of steel, 103,000 square metres of glass, and 330 million litres of concrete, enough to fill 132 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Desert sand, despite its abundance, was entirely unsuitable. Its grains are too small, round, and smooth to provide the fractured surfaces necessary for high-compression concrete, leading builders to import sand from Australia for the project.Sand in the UAE serves multiple roles beyond skyscrapers. It forms the basis of glass production, shapes artificial islands such as The Palm Jumeirah, and replenishes popular tourist beaches through large-scale ‘beach nourishment’ projects. According to the UN , constructing the Palm Jumeirah alone consumed 186.5 million cubic metres of marine sand, effectively exhausting local reserves.A 2024 UNEP policy brief reinforces this reality, noting that the Middle East’s rapid urbanisation is driving significant global demand for construction sand. While regional countries are beginning to explore more sustainable solutions, the persistent near-term dependence on imports remains deeply entrenched.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, a blueprint to diversify the Kingdom’s economy beyond oil is driving massive infrastructure developments. The $500 billion NEOM city, the futuristic The Line urban concept, and other mega-projects require specialised building materials that meet international standards.Thus, importing industrial-grade sand isn't just a matter of preference but often a necessity. Without it, the construction of ultra-modern facilities, smart cities, and tourism hubs would face significant material shortages or quality compromises.The dependence on imported sand is not just a Saudi issue; it reflects a growing global and urgent concern. The UNEP has flagged that the world is facing a ""sand crisis,"" warning that unregulated sand extraction is leading to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, including riverbed erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.In response, some countries are investing in alternatives like manufactured sand (M-sand), made by crushing rocks to create suitable construction material. Additionally, recycled construction waste is being repurposed to alleviate pressure on natural sand resources.Saudi Arabia, too, is actively exploring these options. While there's no comprehensive national policy yet on reducing sand imports, experts suggest that ongoing innovation in materials science could eventually help the Kingdom lessen its reliance on foreign sand.","Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential. This reliance highlights a global sand crisis, environmental pressures, and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives and innovation in construction materials.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126249828,imgsize-544876,width-400,resizemode-4/126249828.jpg"
