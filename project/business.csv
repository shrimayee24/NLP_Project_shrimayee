EU-India summit on Jan 27; EU says both can protect rules-based international order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-india-summit-on-jan-27-eu-says-both-can-protect-rules-based-international-order/articleshow/126556476.cms,"Image: IANS

European Council President António Luís Santos da Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit India for the 16th India-EU summit on January 27 and also participate in the Republic Day parade as chief guests a day earlier, said the government in an official announcement.The summit will be the culmination of months of hard work by both sides to ramp up bilateral ties that has seen the EU finalising a new strategic agenda for India amidst mounting global uncertainties and its own rupturing transatlantic alliance.Both sides are currently scrambling to finalise a free trade agreement (FTA) that tops the list of expected deliverables from the summit, along with a formal EU-India defence and security partnership to facilitate defence industrial cooperation despite friction over India’s ties with Russia.According to the EU, trade, security, defence, clean transition and people-to-people contact will top the agenda of the discussions. “India is a crucial partner for the EU. Together, we share the capacity and responsibility to protect the rules-based international order. This meeting will be a key opportunity to build on our partnership and drive progress in our cooperation,” said Costa.This will also be the first time that the leaders will attend the Republic Day parade celebrations as guests of honour signalling, according to the 27-nation bloc, the strengthening of the bilateral relationship between the EU and India.“In October 2025, the Council of the EU endorsed the new strategic EU-India agenda, and its objective of further developing EU-India ties. In so doing, it placed specific focus on prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, security and defence, and connectivity and global issues,” it said in a simultaneous announcement about the visit.On the trade front, both sides have found differences related to critical areas like cars, steel and EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a carbon tax on certain goods, the hardest to address. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri had said last week that the CBAM issue was being discussed and India’s effort is to ensure that all its interests are safeguarded when the FTA is finalised.Brussels also wants commitment to the Paris Agreement, the international treaty for climate action, enshrined in the FTA even though India sees it as a sovereignty issue that should not be mixed with trade. Both sides are hoping political intervention at the highest level will help break this deadlock.“India and EU are strategic partners since 2004. The 15th India-EU Summit was held virtually on 15 July 2020. Bilateral ties have expanded and deepened across a wide range of areas, particularly following the historic visit of EU College of Commissioners to India in February 2025,” said the Indian government, adding that the visit will advance cooperation in areas of mutual interest.Progress is also expected in efforts by the EU to advance, within the IMEC framework, the EU-Africa-India Digital Corridor through a submarine cable system connecting Europe to India via the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. This EU initiative, as the new strategic agenda says, will provide ultra- high-speed, secure, and diversified data connectivity resilient to disruptions caused by natural disasters or acts of sabotage.",European Council President António Luís Santos da Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit India for the 16th India-EU summit on January 27. The summit will be the culmination of months of hard work by both sides to ramp up bilateral ties.

Experts warn: Mass removal of stray dogs could backfire on public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-warn-mass-removal-of-stray-dogs-could-backfire-on-public-health/articleshow/126556050.cms,"Image: IANS

Free-living dogs form stable social groups when food sources, sterilisation, and vaccination coverage remain consistent.

Large-scale removal disrupts these systems, creating territorial vacuums that are rapidly filled by other dogs -- often unvaccinated and unsterilised -- an effect associated with increased dog-bite incidents and heightened disease risk.

Mass removal undermines rabies control by dismantling herd immunity. India’s existing Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (CNVR) framework, when implemented consistently, targets the internationally recognised threshold of vaccinating at least 70% of dogs in a given area.

Data show steep declines in human rabies deaths and dog-bite incidence in areas with sustained sterilisation and vaccination programmes. Abandoning this approach risks reversing hard-earned gains achieved over past two decades.

Mass sheltering, experts argue, compounds the risks. High-density animal housing is globally classified as a biohazard activity, requiring stringent quarantine, disease surveillance, and worker-safety protocols.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass-shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law, destabilise urban ecosystems and impose enormous fiscal costs, without delivering greater public safety.The cautionary note draws on experience of veterans in public health, behavioural science, veterinary medicine and law. Signatories include Chinny Krishna who pioneered India’s Animal Birth Control programme, evolutionary biologist Lee Dugatkin (University of Louisville, US), Anindita Bhadra of IISER Kolkata, public health expert Leena Menghaney, Pushpinder Singh Khera of AIIMS Jodhpur, and Julie Corfmat of Mission Rabies among a host of others. Organisations include International Companion Animal Network (ICAN), Pet Dog Trainers of Europe (PDTE), International Institute for Canine Ethics (IICE) and Bangalore Hundeskole Academy for Research and Canine Studies (BHARCS). Highlights of their analysis:Dugatkin noted claims justifying removal often rest on myths rather than biology. “These dogs have coexisted with humans in India for millennia. Disrupting stable populations based on fear or misinformation ignores everything we know about animal behaviour and disease ecology,” he said.Anthrozoologist Sindhoor Pangal said the debate had become detached from evidence. “Replacing proven, low-cost public-health systems with a mass-detention model is not just unscientific -- it actively increases risk while draining resources that should be strengthening vaccination and disease prevention,” she said.Position statements from IICE highlight that large shelters frequently experience overcrowding, stress-induced immunosuppression, and rapid disease transmission, particularly where enforcement capacity is limited.Free-living dogs play a role in urban ecosystems by scavenging waste and limiting proliferation of rats and other scavengers that can’t be vaccinated or monitored. Sudden dog removal can lead to rodent population explosions linked to diseases such as leptospirosis and plague.Legal experts point out that mass relocation directly contradicts the Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2023, which mandate sterilisation, vaccination, and return to the original territory. Large-scale confinement also raises constitutional and labour-safety concerns, given occupational hazards associated with mass animal housing.","A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court.

Democracy delivers in India: PM Modi at CW meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/democracy-delivers-in-india-pm-modi-at-cw-meet/articleshow/126555452.cms,"PM Modi said India has been voicing the interests of Global South countries at international platforms

PM Modi Positions India As Global South Voice Says Democracy Delivers Stability And Growth

NEW DELHI: Democratic spirit runs in India’s veins and is underpinned by its values, PM Narendra Modi said Thursday, asserting that the country had belied post-Independence apprehensions about its future as it turned its diversity into strength and showed the world that its democratic institutions and processes deliver stability, speed and scale.Addressing the 28th conference of speakers and presiding officers of the Commonwealth at the central hall of Samvidhan Sadan, the old Parliament building, after inaugurating the event, he said democracy in India means last-mile delivery for citizens and working for everyone’s welfare without any discrimination. “In India, democracy delivers,” he said.With representatives from many Global South countries present in the audience, Modi said India has been strongly voicing their interests at international platforms and has striven to ensure that its innovations benefit them. Under its presidency of G20, India put Global South’s concerns at the centre of global agenda.“When the world is undergoing unprecedented changes, then it is also time for Global South to chart a new path,” Modi said, adding that India is home to over 50% of the population of Commonwealth countries and is fulfilling its commitment to their sustainable development goals. In this context, he recalled vaccines and other medical aid India had provided to many countries during the Covid outbreak.Turning to India’s ancient democratic culture, he said its over 5,000-year-old Vedas have referred to assemblies where people met to deliberate and arrive at agreements on different issues while the Buddhist Sangha used to have open discussions and made decisions through consensus or voting.He said, “A 10th-century inscription from Tamil Nadu describes a village assembly that worked with democratic values. There were clear rules for accountability and decisionmaking. Our democratic values have been tested by time, supported by diversity and strengthened generation after generation.”Hundreds of languages are spoken in India’s diverse democracy, while over 900 TV channels are broadcast and thousands of newspapers and periodicals are published, he said. “Very few societies manage diversity at this scale. India celebrates such diversity because our democracy has a strong foundation. India is called the Mother of Democracy.” He noted that with 980-million registered voters, the 2024 LS election was not only the largest democratic exercise in human history but also witnessed record participation of women.Addressing delegates, who included 61 presiding officers from 46 countries, Speaker Om Birla flagged concerns over the misuse of emerging technologies like AI, while noting these have also boosted efficiency. Their misuse has presented challenges of misinformation, cybercrime and social disharmony, and effective solutions are needed to counter the threat posed to democracies, he said. India’s over seven-decade-long parliamentary journey has been strengthened through people-centric policies and welfare-focused legislation, he said.","PM Modi Positions India As Global South Voice Says Democracy Delivers Stability And Growth.

GANDHINAGAR: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said Adi Shankaracharya was instrumental in establishing the Indian identity and ensuring that the banner of Sanatan dharma fluttered high in all corners of the country.Speaking at the launch of a 'granthavali' of Shankaracharya in Gujarati at an event in Ahmedabad, Shah expressed confidence that the complete works of the 8th-century scholar of Advaita Vedanta, published in 15 volumes, will help youth from Gujarat delve into them and leave an impact on their lives and work. ""You will find solutions to all the questions that existed in society of that time in these texts,"" Shah said.Shah said very few people can accomplish so much in such a short lifetime: ""Shankaracharya travelled extensively across country on foot, and in a way, he played the role of a walking university.

He said in his lifetime, Adi Shankaracharya addressed doubts that had arisen around Sanatan dharma amid the rise of various philosophical schools, including Buddhism, Jainism, Kapalika and Tantric traditions. He provided logical answers to all the questions and doubts, Shah said.""Shankaracharya not only gave ideas, but also offered India a synthesis of ideas.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have projected a massive victory for Mahayuti in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, with the BJP–Shiv Sena alliance set to cross the 130-seat mark in Asia’s richest civic body. In contrast, the Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS alliance is expected to lag far behind, with projections placing it at just over 60 seats. Congress is likely to get around 20 seats.While the Axis My India poll estimated 141 seats for the alliance, JVC has forecast a tally of 138 wards.Meanwhile, the much-anticipated reunion of estranged Thackeray cousins -- Uddhav and Raj -- after two decades appears unlikely to translate into significant electoral gains, with the Axis My India exit poll projecting just 63 seats for the alliance. The JVC poll estimated a similar outcome, forecasting 59 wards for the Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS combine.The last BMC elections were held in 2017, and the term of the corporators ended on March 7, 2022. However, fresh polls could not be conducted on time due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Supreme Court rulings on OBC reservations, and issues related to ward delimitation, resulting in the civic body being placed under an administrator.Nearly 50% polling was reported in Mumbai and 28 other municipal corporations across Maharashtra on Thursday.Addressing the media after voting concluded at 5.30pm, state election commissioner Dinesh Waghmare said voter turnout across the 29 civic bodies was estimated to be between 46 and 50%, adding that the final figures would be announced later.","Nearly 50% polling was reported in Mumbai and 28 other municipal corporations across Maharashtra on Thursday.

'Leave By Any Means': India Issues Fresh Advisory As Iran Protests Intensify Across Cities

""IndiGo flight 6E1808 is now the last non-Iran-registered passenger aircraft in Iranian airspace,”

Flightradar24 said on X at 3.49 am (IST) Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Flights between India and the west will get longer as airlines have stopped overflying the Iranian and Iraqi airspace due to the evolving situation in the region. The sudden closure of Iranian airspace for some time on Wednesday-Thursday night meant Air India had to cancel Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea. Air India will cancel some flights where rerouting is not possible. For Indian carriers, avoiding Iran and Iraq will mean not overflying the entire stretch from Iraq right upto Pakistan. Accordingly, IndiGo could take a call on its Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights shortly as flying between those places and India will mean taking an extraordinary long route that will require a felling halt some place like Jordan.The Iranian airspace was suddenly closed on Wednesday-Thursday night.A notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued Thursday at 22:15 (UTC or GMT) said: “Tehran flight information region (FIR) closed to all flights except international civil arrivals and departures to and from Tehran FIR with prior permission from Iran Civil Aviation Authority.”Subsequently another NOTAM was issued saying “Tehran FIR resumed normal operations” but multiple airlines are avoiding the airspace for safety reasons.Air India said on X Thursday morning: “Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays. Some Air India flights where currently rerouting is not possible are being cancelled. We request passengers to check the status of their flights on our website before heading to the airport. Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority.”A Lufthansa spokesperson said: “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the Lufthansa Group has decided, after careful evaluation, to operate flights to and from Tel Aviv and Amman as day flights from Thursday, January 15 up to and including Monday, January 19, 2026. This means that crews fly back immediately afterwards without an overnight stay on site. In some cases, there may also be flight cancellations. In addition, Iranian and Iraqi airspace will be circumnavigated by all Lufthansa Group airlines until further notice.”“The Lufthansa Group continues to monitor the situation closely and will continue to assess the situation in the coming days. Affected passengers will be automatically rebooked and proactively contacted. Alternatively, guests can rebook to a later travel date. The safety of our guests and crew members is always our top priority,” the spokesperson said.A Jan 11 analyst update by Osprey Flight Solutions titled “Iran: Main urban centres: Further violent clashes near certain in the short term amid deteriorating security situation” says: “Operators are advised that the security situation in Iran's main urban centres remains fluid and subject to rapid change amid the ongoing violence. While airport operations have remained largely unaffected, disruption is possible in the short term, to include airport worker involvement in protests, impacting staffing levels at facilities. Additionally, fuel shortages at airports and direct protest action at/near facilities are possible in the short term….”","The Iranian airspace was suddenly closed on Wednesday-Thursday night.

NEW DELHI: A 43-year-old widow from Assam, who was deported recently to Bangladesh, has approached the Supreme Court alleging she was wrongly declared an illegal migrant even though all 16 members of her family are in National Register of Citizens . The court has ordered officials to verify the documents submitted by her brother.Aheda Khatun was taken to detention centre on Sept 30 after Gauhati high court rejected her plea in Aug.Her lawyer Adeel Ahmed said she was deported to Bangladesh from Matila transit camp on Dec 19 while her case was pending in SC.Khatun said she was born in India in 1981 to parents who were already enrolled as voters for decades and she is an Indian by birth under Section 3(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act.The NRC family list shows that every member of the petitioner's family, including her father, mother, and fourteen siblings, has been categorised as accepted in the final NRC. The petitioner alone was marked DV (doubtful voter) solely due to the pendency of the case (before a Foreigners Tribunal).

She moved the high court after a delay of more than five years. She was detained after her plea was dismissed.Challenging the HC order, she submitted that her plea was rejected for delay without going into the merit of the case. As her brother has filed the affidavit on her behalf, the court issued notice on the plea and said, ""Let notice be issued for the limited purpose of enquiring into the genuineness of the documents relied upon by the petitioner's brother, who has filed affidavit on her behalf.""The petition said, ""The Foreigners Tribunal fundamentally erred in placing an insurmountable and legally impermissible burden upon her under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946, by rejecting even statutory and certified public documents produced by her, without any rebuttal or contradictory evidence by the State.""""The petitioner had produced nine documents - including four consecutive voter lists (1965, 1970, 1985, 1997), Jamabandi, mutation order, registered gift deed, school certificate, and Gaonburah certificate - all of which are primary evidence of lineage and citizenship.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Election Commission to make public the names of people excluded from the draft electoral rolls published after the special intensive revision process in Kerala to enable affected voters to raise objections. A bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant also asked the poll panel to consider extending the deadline, preferably by two weeks, for filing objections against the deletion of names. The counsel, appearing for EC, said that the issue of extension of deadline will be considered. The bench was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the special intensive revision (SIR) process undertaken in Kerala.The petitioners include Kerala, senior political netas such as PK Kunhalikutty of IUML and MV Govindan Master of CPM.The pleas have said the SIR process, as currently executed, risks disenfranchising a massive segment of the population due to technical errors and a lack of a robust redressal mechanism. During the brief hearing, the counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that according to the draft rolls released after the revision, nearly 24 lakh names had been deleted.It was argued that while voters are required to file objections against deletion, the list of excluded persons has not been made accessible, effectively denying them a meaningful opportunity to contest the removal of their names.""They have to list objections, but the list of those persons deleted is not available. Now people have to file objections stating why have you deleted me... that opportunity is missing for us,"" one lawyer said.The petitioners further said that in the draft rolls, some voters have been erroneously shown as deceased, while others have been marked as residing outside the state. The lack of transparency has caused serious difficulties for voters, particularly in rural areas.","The Supreme Court asked the Election Commission to make public the names of people excluded from the draft electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.This notification comes barely a month before the scheduled rollout of Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF), or barrierless tolling, on around half a dozen stretches of the NH network.The notification was issued early this week. Work of MLFF is at an advanced stage at Manoharpur and Shahjahanpur on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, at Chorasi on the Surat-Vadodara stretch of NH-48 and at Gharonda on Delhi-Chandigarh highway. The changes in Central Motor Vehicles Rules are expected to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one skips paying toll when barrierless tolling is implemented.On MLFF stretches, there will be no physical barrier to stop vehicles for the collection of user fee. As per the notification, any “unpaid user fee” will be linked with the NOCs for vehicle related services and transactions. It defines unpaid user fee as the user fee payable by a vehicle for use of a section of NH, where the electronic toll collection system has recorded the passage of such vehicle but has not received the applicable user fee levied.Officials said that soon there will be a portal where people will be able to raise their complaints for settling disputes. “There will be enough scope for settlement before initiating action of blocking the NOC,” an official said.The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

MCX Gold has regained its bullish momentum after a short consolidation phase and is now trading around the all-time high of 143,500. With upward strength reasserting itself and minimal signs of a reversal, the rally is likely to extend to higher levels. The recent breakout reinforces the strength of the move, and the overall outlook remains positive as long as prices stay above the breakout zone.From a weekly perspective, the 139,000 level remains a key support area, marking the lower boundary of the consolidation range. Any dip toward this zone is expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this support strengthens the bullish structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well placed to advance toward the 151,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective rise is in line with the broader bullish trend and underscores the strength of prevailing market momentum. Additionally, a decisive and sustained breakout above the consolidation range resistance has attracted fresh buying interest, reinforcing positive sentiment and setting the stage for a continued upward move.Overall, Gold remains well positioned to maintain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly favouring trend continuation. As long as prices stay above the crucial 139,000 support, the bullish setup remains valid. With momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continuing to be supportive, the precious metal looks well placed for further upside in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has recorded a new all-time high this week, continuing its pattern of higher highs seen over the past several months. With little indication of a slowdown, the overall bias stays positive, and any pullbacks are likely to attract buying interest. We advise trading in line with the prevailing trend, which remains strongly bullish.Silver’s early-week rally has underscored a renewed strength in the trend, increasing the probability of further upside. As long as prices hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias should remain intact. The immediate key support lies around the 266,000 mark, which may offer a favourable buying opportunity. Any dip toward this zone is expected to draw fresh buying interest, aiding price stability and preserving upward momentum.On the upside, Silver appears well placed to test the 320,000 resistance in the near to medium term. This projected advance represents a continuation of the existing bullish phase and is strongly backed by healthy market momentum and supportive technical indicators.

Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Budget 2026

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch said, ""India’s VDA ecosystem is at a pivotal stage, with growing adoption across the country. However, the current tax framework presents challenges for retail participants by taxing transactions without recognising losses, creating friction rather than fairness. A reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1% to 0.01% could improve liquidity, ease compliance, and enhance transparency while preserving transaction traceability. Raising the TDS threshold to ₹5 lakh would help protect small investors from disproportionate impact.""""Introduced in 2022 as a stand-in for regulation at that time, VDA taxation has since been complemented by strong oversight from FIU-IND and improved compliance. This Budget presents a great opportunity to revisit the framework in a manner beneficial to both investors and the government. We remain hopeful that the government will recognize this gap and consider reviewing the current framework soon,"" he concluded.","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities. Offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Billy Gunn’s wrestling career details and financial history

Paula Heaney-Sopp’s contributions and net worth of the couple

Billy Gunn, whose real name is Monty Kip Sopp, is a professional wrestler with a long and distinguished career spanning more than 30 years. His current net worth is estimated at $3 million to $5 million, attributable to his contributions to AEW and WWE. Billy Gunn's wife, Paula Heaney-Sopp, who has been married to him since 2009 and is not directly involved in wrestling, plays a significant behind-the-scenes role in developing the family’s brand identity.Billy's earnings are primarily from his WWE career. He received the most recognition in the 1990s, when he was part of the tag team The Smoking Gunns, and later, in one of his legendary roles, he worked with Road Dogg as part of The New Age Outlaws. When he joined AEW, Gunn initially served as a coach, but soon returned to the ring as a wrestler, teaming up with Max Caster and Anthony Bowens as The Acclaimed and winning the AEW World Trios Championship.In spite of health challenges in 2025, including major surgeries and back stress fractures, he continues to be a well-respected old-timer who sometimes takes the stage while doing his coaching work at the same time.AEW's contract with Billy, who has an annual value of about $500,000, screams for revenue into one's income already augmented by WWE royalties and appearances.Paula’s role in the company primarily involved social media engagement, content creation in the lifestyle category, and support for promotions for Gunn and their wrestlers’ sons, Austin and Colten. Although her personal net worth is minimal compared with Gunn's, estimated at roughly six figures, the latter still clearly signals her presence in the digital media and brand support space.According to estimates, the wealth of the couple in the year 2025 will be approximately $5-6 million, which will be supported by the financial base established through Gunn's WWE and AEW career, plus the efforts of Paula, which not only strengthen the family's overall brand equity but also make it more visible. Their alliance, ultimately, reflects how hard-won victories, when combined with effective branding and backing, can lead to long-term profitability and market acceptance.","Billy Gunn, whose real name is Monty Kip Sopp, is a professional wrestler with a long and distinguished career spanning more than 30 years.

Tyreek Hill, or popularly known as “Cheetah,"" built his wealth by turning speed into production every Sunday. Keeta Vaccaro, however, followed a quieter but calculated path through entrepreneurship. Their financial story sits at the intersection of elite NFL money and modern startup culture.Hill remains one of football’s highest-paid stars. Meanwhile, Vaccaro continues to operate as an independent entrepreneur. Although their paths now run separately, their combined net worth still reflects how far each had climbed by the time they eventually split up.Tyreek Hill’s net worth is estimated at $60 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. His annual salary sits close to $30 million.However, the real jump came in March 2022, when Hill signed a four-year, $120 million deal with the Miami Dolphins. In August 2024, the Dolphins restructured the contract to $90 million over three years with $65 million guaranteed, increasing his total guaranteed money to $106.5 million.Even though contracts define the numbers, performance keeps them alive. Hill followed his 1,799-yard 2023 season with another Pro Bowl year in 2024.He remained Miami’s offensive engine, finishing among league leaders in yards and explosive plays.Hill also invested heavily in real estate, including a $6.9 million mansion in Southwest Ranches, purchased in May 2022.Keeta Vaccaro’s net worth ranges between $7 million and $8 million, as reported by Sportskeeda. Though often labeled an influencer, Vaccaro operates primarily as an entrepreneur. She graduated from the University of Miami in 2019 with a degree in entrepreneurship and marketing. She later launched Own Flow, a fitness platform, and Investacess, a startup funding app.Even though her income lacks the visibility of NFL contracts, her value sits in equity, digital products, and long-term brand positioning.Together, Hill and Vaccaro have a combined net worth of $67 million to $68 million. However, that figure leaned heavily toward Hill’s NFL earnings. Vaccaro’s wealth reflected business valuation rather than liquid cash. Their combined financial peak aligned with the 2024 NFL season, though they separated in April 2025.Cheetah has partnered with famous brands like Adidas, Grip Boost, and other performance brands.

Budget 2026: The urgent need to tackle long-pending and long drawn-out tax litigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-the-urgent-need-to-tackle-long-pending-and-long-drawn-out-tax-litigation/articleshow/126556471.cms,"As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals). (AI image)

Here are top five issues that

Budget 2026

should tackle:

1. Reduce pendency before CIT(A) and allow refund of taxes collected during pendency of appeal

2. Rationalise provisions to facilitate obtaining full stay of demand during pendency of appeals

3. Reducing administrative inconvenience and hardship

4. Avoiding repetitive appeals by the Revenue

5. Strengthening the advance ruling mechanism

As the Union Budget 2026 draws closer, industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to the far more structural problem of long-pending direct tax litigation. On the ground, businesses argue that predictability, timeliness and administrative efficiency in dispute resolution matter as much as headline tax rates—particularly for capital-intensive sectors such as manufacturing.The scale of the problem is substantial. As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals), involving disputed demands of about ₹18.16 lakh crore. Protracted disputes result in working capital being locked up for years, management attention diverted from productive activity, and depressed valuations when Indian promoters seek foreign investment.Industry body FICCI has flagged the mounting backlog at the CIT(A) level as a critical bottleneck in the dispute resolution framework.The first appellate authority, meant to serve as an effective corrective forum, has instead become a point of prolonged delay.FICCI points out that pendency increased sharply after the faceless appeal regime was rolled out in 2021. While faceless appeals were introduced to eliminate physical interface and improve transparency, the absence of effective monitoring and the unfamiliarity of both officers and taxpayers with the technology have led to repeated notices, duplication of submissions and delayed disposals. Even where taxpayers have filed detailed responses on the portal, they are often asked to resubmit information without clarity on what additional inputs are required. Virtual hearings, when sought, are not granted liberally, and even when conducted, limitations in document presentation weaken effective representation.A key procedural gap, according to FICCI, is the absence of any time limit for assessing officers to submit remand reports called for by the CIT(A), coupled with ambiguity over whether jurisdictional officers or faceless units are responsible for such reports. Meanwhile, parallel penalty proceedings are routinely initiated while quantum appeals remain pending, resulting in both quantum and penalty matters piling up at the first appellate stage.The industry body warns that the litigation lifecycle—already 12 to 15 years before Covid—has now lengthened by another five years. This not only delays revenue collection for the government but also forces companies to carry disputed tax demands as contingent liabilities, adversely impacting share valuations during fund-raising or stake sales.To address this, FICCI has recommended prioritised disposal of appeals involving high-pitched assessments, scrutiny cases, matters where detailed submissions have already been filed, issues covered by High Court or Supreme Court rulings, and appeals pending for over five years. It has also called for filling nearly 40% vacancies at the CIT(A) level and introducing a dual-track system, with fast-track disposal for simple, low-value cases and a detailed track for complex, high-value disputes, backed by differentiated timelines and targets.Tax professional Sandeep Bhalla, Partner at Dhruva Advisors, notes that appeals pending before the CIT(A) for more than two years cause serious hardship, particularly where disputed demands continue to remain outstanding. He argues that in such cases, taxpayers should not be compelled to wait indefinitely and should be allowed to approach the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) directly.Bhalla suggests a structured mechanism under which the assessee could approach the Range Head (Additional or Joint Commissioner), who would prepare a concise factual and legal factsheet. This, along with the appeal records, could then be placed directly before the Tribunal for adjudication. Such a process, he believes, would help decongest the CIT(A) level while ensuring quicker resolution of long-pending disputes.At the same time, Bhalla emphasises that institutional accountability must be built into the system so that appeals remaining undisposed beyond two years without taxpayer fault are treated as a measurable performance failure rather than an administrative inevitability.FICCI has also called for a rethink of the current framework governing stay of disputed tax demands. Although CBDT instructions provide that a stay may be granted on payment of 20% of the disputed demand, taxpayers are often required to make this payment even when the issue has been decided in their favour in earlier years.Compounding the problem, refunds for subsequent years are routinely adjusted by the Central Processing Centre (CPC) against demands that are formally stayed, because stay orders are not digitally integrated with CPC systems. According to FICCI, this defeats the very purpose of a stay and intensifies liquidity stress for businesses.To resolve this, the industry body has suggested creating a real-time interface enabling assessing officers to upload stay orders so that stayed demands are automatically excluded from refund adjustments. It has also proposed allowing alternative forms of security—such as bank guarantees or indemnities—in appropriate cases instead of insisting on a cash pre-deposit, noting that international tax administrations adopt similar risk-based approaches without compromising revenue protection.Bhalla highlights that even after taxpayers succeed in appeals, delays in passing Orders Giving Effect (OGEs) often render appellate relief meaningless. Refunds remain on paper for months, or even years, resulting in continued cash-flow strain.He recommends that OGEs be system-driven and mandatorily passed within three months, with interest payable for departmental delays made personally recoverable from the concerned assessing officer. Mandatory uploading of scrutiny and compliance reports on the tax portal, he argues, would enhance transparency and accountability.Bhalla also points to the largely mechanical nature of rectifications under section 154 against CPC adjustments under section 143(1). He suggests that taxpayers should be allowed to file detailed reconciliations, that CPC orders rejecting rectification must give clear reasons, and that a virtual hearing should be provided wherever adjustments are proposed to be confirmed.Despite settled judicial precedents, the Revenue continues to litigate recurring issues, adding to the backlog. Bhalla recommends that the CBDT issue authoritative position papers on key settled matters, particularly those affecting specific industries, and hold field officers accountable for filing appeals contrary to binding rulings.Bhalla also flags concerns around the functioning of the Board for Advance Rulings, which replaced the Authority for Advance Rulings in 2021. More than four years on, the mechanism has failed to deliver the certainty it was meant to provide, especially for cross-border and high-value transactions, underscoring the need for corrective measures in Budget 2026.As India positions itself as a preferred investment destination, the credibility of its tax dispute resolution system will be closely watched by both domestic and global investors. Meaningful reforms that reduce pendency, ensure timely refunds and curb avoidable litigation could significantly improve confidence on the ground. Budget 2026, therefore, has a chance to signal that tax certainty and administrative efficiency are central to the government’s growth strategy.","As of April 1, 2025, nearly 5.4 lakh appeals were pending before the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) Industry bodies and tax professionals are urging the government to shift part of its reform focus from tax rate rationalisation to long-pending direct tax litigation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126556606,imgsize-148077,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-tax.jpg"

Currently, it is reported that Carson Kelly is a player of the Chicago Cubs who has recently signed a two-year contract worth an annual package of around $11 million, including a bonus.Even though he will be receiving one of his highest salaries from the Chicago Cubs, Carson Kelly’s annual net worth still stands at $5 million as per the latest financial report.On the other hand, Miguel Amaya’s current net worth is much lower than Carson Kelly’s, as he’s an emerging player, and he is currently receiving the standard wage for his baseball leagues. Further, Miguel Amaya's financial profile remains under his club's control.Miguel Amaya has less experience in his professional baseball career than Carson Kelly, which is one of the factors for his low net worth at present. Further, there is no report suggesting that either player, Carson Kelly or Miguel Amaya, is involved in any kind of outsourced income, such as private ventures or brand endorsements.Given their performance and consistency in the leagues, it is believed that both Carson Kelly and Miguel Amaya will be staying for a long time in the leagues if not injured.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

Why solid rocket motors matter

Small suppliers under pressure

A shrinking industrial base

The ripple effect risk

How companies are responding

Pentagon funding and lingering gaps





As conflicts from Venezuela to West Asia drive a renewed surge in US demand for missiles and munitions, a less visible but increasingly critical bottleneck is emerging deep inside the American defence supply chain. The problem is not a lack of missile designs or prime contractors, but a growing shortage of solid rocket motors and, more importantly, the specialised materials and components needed to produce them, according to reporting by Breaking Defense.Senior industry executives told Breaking Defense that while the Pentagon is pushing to rapidly expand munitions stockpiles, the fragile and highly concentrated supply chain that underpins solid rocket motors has not kept pace. This mismatch is raising concerns about whether the United States can scale missile production fast enough in a prolonged, multi-theatre crisis environment.Solid rocket motors power many of the US military’s most important weapons, including the Army’s Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System and the Navy’s Standard Missile family. Demand for these systems has surged in recent years as Washington replenishes stocks drawn down by support for allies and prepares for high-intensity conflicts.That surge has encouraged new players to enter the market and pushed established manufacturers to expand. However, executives say growth at the top has not been matched by growth at the lower tiers of the supply chain, where many critical parts and chemicals are produced by just one or two suppliers.“We don’t really need a third solid rocket motor provider,” L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik said in September. “We need more companies that make nozzles. We need more companies that make igniters. We need more companies that make cases.”One example highlighted by Breaking Defense is Helicon Chemical Company, a small Orlando-based firm trying to become a second supplier for HTPB-45M, a binding agent used in most solid rocket motors. Helicon planned to set up production in West Virginia, backed by a $15 million Pentagon contract. That funding has been stalled by budget uncertainty.“The situation is aggravated by the ongoing lapse in the Small Business Innovation Research program,” Helicon CEO Jack Sarnicki told Breaking Defense, adding that another government shutdown could be devastating.“Everything has come to a screeching halt,” Sarnicki said. “If we don’t get under contract and another government shutdown occurs, we could have real issues with my company. We would probably have to think about laying off people.”Even if funding resumes, Helicon estimates it would take 18 months to two years to qualify production, meaning every delay directly extends the timeline before a second supplier becomes available.According to defence analytics firm Govini, the US industrial base for solid rocket motors has dramatically narrowed over the past three decades. Between 1995 and 2017, the number of US providers fell from six to just two, Orbital ATK, now part of Northrop Grumman, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, acquired by L3Harris in 2023. A third producer, Norway-based Nammo, manufactures some motors overseas.While startups such as Anduril, Ursa Major and X-Bow, along with firms like General Dynamics, are now trying to expand capacity, Govini warns that many critical inputs remain single-source or have long lead times.“The Department leadership has a real opportunity right now,” Govini CEO Tara Murphy Dougherty told Breaking Defense. “But as of right now, they’re going to do things the exact same way and somehow expect different results from a supply chain management perspective.”One of the biggest vulnerabilities lies in energetics, the chemicals that enable propulsion. Govini notes that American Pacific Corporation is the only US-based producer of ammonium perchlorate, a key propellant ingredient, creating what it calls a “single point of failure.”Nammo encountered a similar risk in 2025, when a chemical supplier for one of its propellants went out of business without an alternative source. Andy Davis, Nammo’s vice president of engineering and strategy, explained why such disruptions are hard to fix quickly.“One of the challenges you have that people don’t understand is a propellant formulation is made up of, say, 10 to 12 ingredients,” Davis said. “So if you take, say, aluminum powder, and you’ve qualified a formulation with one aluminum powder and that manufacturer no longer supplies that aluminum, it’s not as simple as ‘I’m just going to go get another aluminum powder and put it in.’”Replacing a single ingredient can force companies to requalify the propellant, the rocket motor and sometimes the entire missile, a process that can take years.The risks are not theoretical. In October, an explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems in Tennessee killed 16 people and destroyed a facility that Govini identified as a sub-tier supplier to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Northrop and Nammo.“This should be a wake up call,” Murphy Dougherty said. “There’s just a lack of redundancy for a lot of these components and parts in critical systems like solid rocket motors.”To work around bottlenecks, companies are adopting different strategies. Anduril is pushing suppliers to expand into adjacent components and, in some cases, teaching them new manufacturing techniques.“We’ve fired motors with that case,” said Bret Perry, Anduril’s head of growth for rocket motor systems, referring to a supplier it helped transition into making motor cases.Ursa Major is betting on vertical integration, producing more components in-house. “We’re actually buying powder and sintering it ourselves,” said Bill Murray, the company’s vice president of product and engineering.Large primes are also investing heavily. L3Harris has spent more than $250 million on long-lead materials and supplier upgrades, while Northrop Grumman says it has invested over $1 billion across its solid rocket motor facilities and plans to double output over four years.Congress has allocated billions of dollars to shore up the solid rocket motor industrial base, including hundreds of millions specifically for second-source suppliers. The Pentagon has awarded contracts to expand nozzle and motor case production and to prototype new manufacturing techniques.Yet for small suppliers like Helicon, the gap between policy intent and on-the-ground reality remains wide.“We’re a small company way down the food chain,” Sarnicki said. “You’ll read the articles that Raytheon gets a huge contract, or Northrop gets it. Everything seems great. But you have to be able to produce it.”As the US accelerates missile production amid global instability, Breaking Defense reports that the success of that effort may hinge less on headline contracts and more on whether the Pentagon can stabilise and diversify the vulnerable supply chains that sit far from public view.","The Pentagon is pushing to rapidly expand munitions stockpiles. But the fragile and highly concentrated supply chain that underpins solid rocket motors has not kept pace. This mismatch is raising concerns about whether the United States can scale missile production fast enough in a prolonged, multi-theatre crisis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126549270,imgsize-1478831,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Omi In A Hellcat released after serving time for illegal IPTV operation





A viral video circulating on social media this week showed YouTuber Omi In A Hellcat walking out of federal custody, marking the end of a long-running and high-profile criminal case. The short clip, shared widely on X, captured the moment he was greeted by friends after his release, quickly drawing thousands of reactions. His release closes a chapter that has followed the creator since 2019, when federal investigators first began examining his activities. For many online viewers, the video symbolized the fall and return of a once-flamboyant internet personality whose lifestyle had drawn both admiration and scrutiny.Omi In A Hellcat, whose real name is Bill Omar Carrasquillo, is a 39-year-old content creator from New Jersey with strong ties to Philadelphia. He rose to fame in the late 2010s through YouTube videos showing luxury cars, custom vehicle builds, jewelry, and an expensive lifestyle. At his peak, his channel had over 800,000 subscribers. Behind the scenes, however, federal prosecutors say that much of his wealth came from an illegal IPTV business that secretly generated millions of dollars while distributing pirated television content.According to federal authorities, Carrasquillo operated an illegal service called Gears TV Reloaded between 2016 and 2019. The operation sold modified Amazon Firesticks and monthly subscriptions that gave users access to more than 1,000 pirated TV channels, movies, live sports, and pay-per-view events. This content was taken without permission from major providers such as Comcast, Verizon FiOS, and DirecTV. Investigators later concluded the business earned more than $30 million in revenue.Carrasquillo and a number of his accomplices were indicted on a number of different federal charges, including copyright infringement, wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. In 2022, he pleaded guilty to 62 charges. In 2023, a year later, he received a 66-month federal prison term, with three years of supervised release. He was further ordered to forfeit around $30 million worth of his assets, including cash, jewelry, property, and 57 automobiles, all of which were later auctioned off.He was released near January 6, 2026, after serving approximately three years, with an early release because of his exemplary conduct and the time he had already served. This particular incident serves as a reminder of the severe legal implications that come with digital piracy and how notoriety on the internet can be swiftly disintegrated when illicit methods of doing business are employed.Also Read: Kai Cenat clashes with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy after leaked Streamer Awards footage","Omi In A Hellcat, real name Bill Omar Carrasquillo, is a 39-year-old content creator from New Jersey.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ However, he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030

Record spending planned as global health indicators worsen





Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisations. The foundation recently announced that it will spend a record $9 billion in 2026, its highest annual budget so far, while also preparing to cut up to 500 staff positions over the next five years. According to a Fortune report, these moves follow Gates’ decision last year to formally wind down the foundation by 2045, after spending roughly $200 billion over two decades.The latest plan marks a significant shift for the foundation at a time when many of its long-term focus areas — including global health, poverty, and US education — are under pressure due to cuts in international aid.The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget. To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce from the current 2,375 roles, including by leaving some positions unfilled.Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the reductions will be gradual:“We will do this thoughtfully, carefully, and systematically … We’ll be recalibrating it every year.That 500-person target is a maximum target. I very much hope that we won’t have to do it as large as that number.”Suzman said operating costs were projected to reach 18% by 2030 if no action was taken.The $9 billion budget for 2026 includes increases for programmes focused on women’s health, vaccines, polio, AI tools, and education. Gates recently wrote that global health indicators slipped last year, noting that child deaths increased for the first time in two decades.“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates wrote. Still, he said he remains optimistic about long-term progress.The foundation plans to accelerate spending in three key areas:• maternal and child health• infectious disease prevention• poverty reductionNotably, Gates has repeatedly warned about risks from artificial intelligence (AI) but is also investing in its development. The foundation joined a coalition pledging $1 billion toward AI tools for public-sector workers in the U.S.AI remains one of the programmes that will continue to grow, Suzman confirmed.The foundation is also expanding operations in Africa and India, creating a new division focused on the two regions. Work on HIV and tuberculosis will increasingly shift from Seattle to Africa.Despite its planned closure, Suzman said the foundation still has two decades to operate and aims to make its most significant impact during that time.“We are moving into what I believe is going to be the most impactful period of the Gates Foundation,” he said.","Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030.

Contracts and salaries of Kyle Tucker and Shohei Ohtani

Kyle Tucker vs Shohei Ohtani: Endorsements and investments

Kyle Tucker vs Shohei Ohtani: Real estate holdings

Kyle Tucker and Shohei Ohtani are both top-tier players, but their financial situations are quite different. Tucker has been steadily increasing his earnings with his contracts from the Chicago Cubs, making millions through arbitration and brand deals. In contrast, Ohtani has hit astronomical heights, securing a historic $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and pulling in tens of millions more from endorsements.Fans may be curious about how Tucker’s earnings compare to a two-way sensation like Ohtani, whose appeal reaches both the U.S. and Japan. With everything from contracts to endorsements and real estate involved, the financial differences between these two athletes are fascinating.Shohei Ohtani has more than double the net worth as Kyle Tucker. Ohtani is expected to have a net worth of about $150 million by then. The calculation takes into account his $700 million contract with the Dodgers and annual endorsements that range from $40 million to $50 ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌million.On‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ the other hand, through his MLB salary and a fresh contract, Tucker's net worth is considered to be around $60 million.At the end of 2025, Tucker's career earnings are anticipated to reach $57.2 million, while his market value was figured at $195 million prior to signing his most recent ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌contract.Ohtani‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ signed an enormous 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023, which was the largest in sports history at that moment. Under this deal, 97% of the amount is deferred: he will be paid $2 million annually from 2024 through 2033 and then $680 million will be paid out in $68 million installments from 2034 to 2043.The present worth of the deferred sum is approximately $460 million. Ohtani suggested this plan so that the Dodgers can have some flexibility with their salary cap. For 2026, his payroll salary stands at $28,216,944 along with cash earnings of $2 million.Tucker entered into a 4-year $240 million deal with the Dodgers, with an average of $60 million a year - thus becoming the second-highest baseball contract without any deferrals behind just Ohtani's $70 million AAV. The agreement possesses the right to opt out after the second and third years. Prior to this, Tucker earned $16.5 million on a one-year arbitration deal with the Cubs in 2025. His total career earnings have reached $57,175,737 by ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌2025.Ohtani rakes in between $40 million and $50 million annually from endorsements, which makes him one of the top endorsers in the world.In 2025, his marketing earnings were projected to hit $100 million, outpacing LeBron James' $85 million. His appeal across cultures has drawn in brands from both Japan and the U.S., and merchandise sales broke records following his signing with the Dodgers.There's not much public info about Tucker's endorsements, but he does make money from brand deals, with baseball being his primary source of income. Recent sources haven't reported any specific investment details for Tucker.Ohtani bought a house in La Cañada Flintridge, California, for $7.85 million back in May 2024. He’s also part of a $240 million luxury housing project at the Mauna Kea Resort in Hawaii, where he snagged a $17 million property and acts as the celebrity spokesperson. Ohtani has committed to buying one of the 14 homes and intends to build a hitting and pitching facility for his preseason training.On the other hand, Tucker’s real estate investment isn’t publicly known.Also Read: Ryan Weathers says the New York Yankees were never on his radar until the Miami Marlins made the call","Tucker has been steadily increasing his earnings with his contracts from the Chicago Cubs, making millions through arbitration and brand deals.

"Health emergency: Delhi children gasp through winter as demand for nebuliser, inhaler surges; doctors warn of lung damage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/health-emergency-delhi-children-gasp-through-winter-as-demand-for-nebuliser-inhaler-surges-doctors-warn-of-lung-damage/articleshow/126557043.cms,"





NEW DELHI: Delhi’s toxic winter air is leaving an increasingly visible imprint on children’s health, with a sharp rise in respiratory illnesses and a surge in demand for nebulisers, inhalers and asthma medicines during peak pollution months, a new citywide survey found.A survey conducted among chemists across Delhi by clean-air advocacy group Warrior Moms showed that sales of respiratory aids for children spiked between November and January, when air quality routinely slipped into the “very poor” and “severe” categories. Chemists reported that 1 in every 3 nebuliser purchases during winter was for a child, highlighting the growing strain on young, developing lungs.Doctors said the trend reflected what they saw daily in clinics and emergency rooms. Paediatrician Dr Sumit Chakravarty, Associate Director, Paediatrics and Neonatology, Asian Hospital, said winter pollution was driving a sharp rise in cough, wheezing and breathlessness among children. “Children’s lungs are still developing, they spend more time outdoors, and masks often fail to block fine pollutants,” he said.Toxic air, he warned, was triggering asthma attacks and chest infections at younger ages, leading to a worrying dependence on nebulisers and inhalers.“Many children now need stronger treatments, including steroids, because routine medicines are no longer enough. This raises serious concerns about long-term lung damage,” he said, adding that repeated illness was also fuelling anxiety among families.The survey found that demand for nebulisers and asthma medicines nearly doubled during high-smog periods, with some neighbourhoods reporting a 40–60% rise in sales. Commonly dispensed drugs included Asthalin and Levolin inhalers, Budecort Respules, Duolin inhalation solutions and long-term control inhalers such as Seroflo. Parents frequently reported symptoms worsening in early mornings and late evenings, when pollution levels peaked.Zone-wise data showed that north and east Delhi were the worst affected, with chemists in north Delhi reporting an average of 17 nebuliser purchases for children per day, compared with around 9–10 in south and central Delhi. Children with asthma and allergic bronchitis were particularly vulnerable, pharmacists said.Pulmonologist Dr Animesh Arya said Delhi’s winter pollution reached levels that repeatedly inflamed children’s lungs during their most critical years of growth. “The surge in nebuliser and inhaler use is not just about asthma flare-ups. It shows reduced lung resilience caused by sustained exposure to very severe air pollution,” he said.Because children breathe faster and inhale more air relative to their body weight, they absorb higher concentrations of fine particulate matter, increasing the risk of chronic cough, wheezing, frequent infections and, in susceptible children, long-term lung function impairment. Calling it an ongoing public health emergency rather than a seasonal problem, he stressed the need for urgent policy action to improve air quality.The spike in demand also strained supply chains. Pharmacies reported frequent shortages of high-demand medicines during December and January, forcing chemists to scramble for stocks and raising concerns about access to essential respiratory care during pollution peaks.The report urged authorities to anticipate winter surges by ensuring adequate medicine supplies, issuing timely advisories for parents and schools, and strengthening preventive measures. As doctors warned, medicines can only manage symptoms — without urgent action to curb pollution, Delhi risks raising a generation with permanently weakened lungs.","Sales of respiratory aids for children spiked between November and January.

"Electronics prices to rise? Laptops, smartphones & more likely to get expensive — here's what to expect",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/electronics-prices-to-rise-laptops-smartphones-more-likely-to-get-expensive-heres-what-to-expect/articleshow/126556747.cms,"Planning to upgrade your television or finally pick up that smartphone you’ve been eyeing? You might want to act fast as prices of electronic gadgets such as smartphones, televisions and laptops are likely to rise in the coming weeks. Industry executives and market experts have warned of an increase of 4–8% over the next two months, on top of sharp price hikes of up to 21% recorded during November and December.At the center of the issue is the rapid escalation in memory chip prices. Smartphone manufacturers are grappling with rising costs as demand for memory surges, fuelled by the accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. Executives cited by ET have warned that these increases may not be temporary, and could repeat regularly, potentially every quarter or even every month during the year.According to Counterpoint Research, the global memory market has entered what it describes as a “hyper-bull” phase. After a roughly 50% price jump in the previous quarter, prices are expected to rise by another 40–50% in the current quarter, followed by an additional 20% increase between April and June.“Some of the smartphone brands like Vivo and Nothing have raised prices by Rs 3,000-5,000 in January, while others like Samsung are making indirect efforts like cutting down on cash backs and discounts,” Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint Research tolf the financial daily.He added that memory prices might continue to rise further in 2026 and even next year. ""While brands will account for this in new launches, there could be shrinkflation too whereby they may cut corners on some components like display,"" he said.Manufacturers also point to supply constraints. Several phone and television makers say memory chip availability has become a major bottleneck. Super Plastronics, which sells televisions under the Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt brands, said it is currently able to procure only about 10% of its required memory chip orders.“We increased prices by 7% in November, now increasing by 10% this month, and another 4% is planned in February,” said Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive at Super Plastronics. “In fact, discounts will be one of the lowest in the upcoming Republic Day sales.”Retailers have highlighted that the impact is already visible on shop floors. Laptop prices have risen by 5–8%, while large television brands have communicated that further hikes are imminent. “This price increase will impact immediate demand,” said Pulkit Baid, director at Great Eastern Retail.The All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) said smartphone prices climbed between 3% and 21% during November and December. The association, which represents more than 150,000 mobile phone stores nationwide, said current signals from brands suggest cumulative price increases could touch 30% in the months ahead.“This price shock is expected to lead to a significant contraction in the market, with 2026 shipment volumes projected to drop by 10-12%,” said Kailash Lakhyani, chairman of AIMRA. “The most significant impact will be felt in the sub-Rs 20,000 segment, which represents the highest sales volume in India. Consumers are already in a wait-and-watch mode.”Counterpoint Research has also flagged the risk of a sharper downturn in India’s smartphone market in 2026 than its earlier estimate of a 2% decline, citing higher memory costs and rising handset prices. A weaker rupee against the US dollar has further compounded pressures on companies.The scale of the memory price surge is evident in server-grade components as well. Counterpoint data shows that prices of 4GB RDIMM memory rose from $255 in the September quarter of 2025 to $450 in the December quarter, and could climb to $700 by March 2026.","Price of electronic gadgets such as smartphones, televisions and laptops are likely to rise in the coming weeks.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

GUWAHATI: Assamese music icon Zubeen Garg ’s wife Garima Saikia Garg appealed Thursday to the Centre and Assam govt to closely monitor proceedings before the coroner’s court in Singapore and take urgent diplomatic and legal steps to ensure all facts surrounding the singer’s death are placed on record.In a Facebook post, she also urged authorities to pursue prosecution in India “without delay or dilution”. Garg died in Singapore during a yacht trip on Sept 19 last year, a day before he was to perform at North East Festival.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma declined to comment on the Singapore hearings.“Whatever you have read in the media, I have also read the same. The matter is being handled entirely under Singapore’s legal process which is different from the process underway in Assam,” Sarma said, adding that politicians should maintain distance from matters under judicial consideration.","Assamese music icon Zubeen Garg ’s wife Garima Saikia Garg appealed Thursday to the Centre and Assam govt to closely monitor proceedings.

Stock market today: Indian stock market benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened in green on Friday. While Nifty50 was above 25,800, BSE Sensex added more than 700 points. At 10:30 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,862.05, up 196.45 points or 0.77%. BSE Sensex was at 84,084.67, up 701.96 points or 0.84%.Analysts are of the view that stock markets are expected to remain range-bound as investors track corporate earnings, watch developments related to the India-US trade deal, and position themselves ahead of Budget 2026.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There are no triggers to take the market significantly up or down. A directionless drift is the likely trend. A US Supreme Court ruling, which could have led to sharp volatility in global markets, didn’t materialise and since there is no timeline for a ruling such an event is unlikely to influence the market in the near-term. The market is likely to respond to the major Q3 results that will continue to flow in. Better-than-expected results will trigger stock-specific action but these are unlikely to take the market as a whole to significantly higher levels.”“Even minor rallies are likely to be neutralised by FII selling. The increasing short positions being built by FIIs indicate that sustained FII selling is likely to be the near-term trend, till such time we have a trend reversal triggered by positive news or events. For long-term investors, the directionless weak drift in the market provides opportunities to slowly accumulate high quality growth stocks available at fair valuations. ""Wall Street stocks ended higher on Thursday after two consecutive sessions of losses, led by sharp gains in Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs following strong quarterly earnings. Shares of US chipmakers also advanced after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company reported robust results that exceeded market expectations.Asian equities are on course for their longest weekly rally since May, supported by sustained optimism around artificial intelligence.In Indian stock markets, foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of equities worth Rs 4,781 crore on Wednesday, according to provisional data. In contrast, domestic institutional investors provided support to the market, buying shares worth Rs 5,281 crore during the session.","Nifty50 was above 25,800, BSE Sensex added more than 700 points.
