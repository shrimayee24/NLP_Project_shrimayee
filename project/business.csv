Karisma Kapoor’s Kids Challenge Billionaire Dad’s Will in ₹30,000 Cr Estate Feud In Delhi HC

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday allowed a fresh application filed by Priya Kapur seeking the removal of her late husband Sunjay Kapur ’s sister’s name from the court order in proceedings related to his purported will.Justice Jyoti Singh allowed Priya’s plea seeking correction of an earlier order in the ongoing multi-crore estate battle over the late industrialist’s assets.The rectification plea, moved under Sections 151 and 152 of the code of civil procedure, pointed out that the September 10 order wrongly recorded the appearance of Mandhira Kapur, Sunjay’s sister, even though she was neither a party to the suit nor sought to be heard.The HC noted the appearance of senior Geeta Luthra and others for Mandhira Kapur on the date of the hearing. However, Luthra later clarified to the bench that Mandhira was not a party to the proceedings and had not filed any plea to be heard in the matter, nor had anyone appeared for her. The application by Priya contended that her name created a misleading record. The high court passed the order in a plaint filed by Sunjay’s two children along with former wife and actor Karisma Kapoor challenging his purported will and seeking shares in the assets, worth about Rs 30,000 crore, according to media reports.Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Priya Kapur in the case, said including her name in the proceedings was “an attempt by Mandhira to gain backdoor entry into the case.”The high court had directed Priya on September 10 to disclose all movable and immovable assets belonging to him as of June 12, the day of his death. Karisma and Sunjay married in 2003 but divorced in 2016. Sunjay died on June 12 while playing a polo match in London.","Priya Kapur seeks removal of her late husband Sunjay Kapur ’s sister’s name from the court order in proceedings related to his purported will.

"Digitise manuscripts, stop intellectual piracy: PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digitise-manuscripts-stop-intellectual-piracy-pm-modi/articleshow/123862725.cms,"PM at an international conference on the Gyan Bharatam Mission on Friday

NEW DELHI:

PM Modi on Thursday highlighted that India was home to the largest collection of manuscripts, and said it was a tribute to “the dedication of our ancestors towards knowledge, science, reading and learning”.He said while lakhs of manuscripts were lost due to the “cruel blows of history”, India was able to save many which are now part of the country’s civilisational consciousness and heritage. “India’s history is not just about the rise and fall of sultanates,” he said.The PM was speaking at an international conference on the ‘Gyan Bharatam Mission’, which among other things, focuses through a portal on the digitisation and preservation of manuscripts and enhancing access to them.Modi underlined that numerous elements of India’s traditional knowledge system, which have been used for centuries, are often copied and patented by others, “Digital manuscripts will accelerate efforts to counter such misuse and help stop intellectual piracy,” he said. The PM said the mission, announced in the 2025-26 Budget, is set to become “a proclamation of India’s culture, literature, and consciousness”.He also heard presentations by eight working groups constituted under the mission on manuscript conservation, digitisation technologies, metadata standards, legal frameworks, cultural diplomacy and decipherment of ancient scripts.Stating that viewing a manuscript feels akin to travelling back in time, Modi reflected on the vast difference between present-day conditions and those of the past. “India’s history is not merely a record of dynastic victories and defeats,” he said. He noted that while the geography of princely states and kingdoms has changed over time, India has remained intact from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean.“India’s ancient manuscripts reflect the continuous flow of this civilisational journey”, Modi added while highlighting that these manuscripts that exist in nearly 80 languages are also declarations of unity in diversity.Stating that every nation presents its historical assets to the world as symbols of civilizational greatness, the PM noted that countries preserve even a single manuscript or artifact as a national treasure. Modi affirmed that these manuscripts — wherever they may be found in the world — must be documented, digitised, and celebrated as part of India’s civilisational heritage.“India has earned the trust of the world. Today, nations view India as the right place to safeguard and honour cultural heritage” Modi said while referring to how earlier, only a few stolen Indian idols were returned but now, hundreds of ancient idols are being repatriated.","PM was speaking at an international conference on the ‘Gyan Bharatam Mission’ The mission, announced in the 2025-26 Budget, is set to become ‘a proclamation of India’s culture, literature, and consciousness’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123862826,imgsize-1343790,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-at-an-international-conference-on-the-gyan-bharatam-mission-on-friday.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday expressed concern over implementation of reservation for persons with disabilities as those PwD who perform on a par with general candidates and make it to the merit list are not treated as unreserved, like it is done in case of SC/ST reservation, and asked the Centre to rectify it.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that upward movement in reservation, which is allowed for SCs/STs and means that when reserved category students make the merit list, they be treated as unreserved, should be followed for people with disability quota also.""The direct consequence of not providing upward movement to meritorious candidate(s) applying under the category of persons with disabilities would be that even when a candidate with disability scores higher than the cut-off for unreserved category, such a candidate would invariably occupy the reserved seat, thereby denying the opportunity to a lower scoring candidate with disability to make a claim on the seat/post. In our view, this defeats the very purpose of reservation,"" Justice Mehta who penned the judgement for the bench, said.The court said a considerable segment of persons with disabilities remains historically and structurally deprived of opportunities, trapped behind layers of social, economic, and institutional barriers, and it is they who must be placed at the centre of the constitutional promise. ""The aim of state-driven welfare measures is not simply to ensure formal equality, but to dismantle barriers so that the most vulnerable and genuinely disadvantaged can fully access the support intended for them.""We consider it appropriate to require the Union of India to explain whether appropriate measures have been taken to provide the upward movement of meritorious candidates applying against the post/s reserved for persons with disabilities, in case such candidate secures more than the cut-off for the unreserved category. The same principle must also be applied to promotions. Such consideration must be guided by the overarching aim that the true and substantive benefit of reservations reaches those most in need, ensuring that no person with disability is ignored from his rightful claim to the post, merely due to the compounded barriers of poverty, stigma, and lack of access,"" the court said.",Supreme Court expresses concern over reservation for persons with disabilities.

The defence ministry has begun examining a proposal from the Indian Air Force (IAF) to procure 114 ""Made in India"" Rafale fighter jets in collaboration with French manufacturer Dassault Aviation and Indian aerospace firms.Estimated to be worth over Rs 2 lakh crore, with more than 60 percent indigenous content, the mega deal is expected to be taken up by the Defence Procurement Board, headed by the Defence Secretary, in the coming weeks, officials told ANI.Once cleared, the proposal will move to the Defence Acquisition Council for final approval.The new acquisition would take the number of Rafales in India’s arsenal to 176, adding to the 36 already inducted by the IAF and 36 ordered for the Indian Navy under separate government-to-government agreements.Officials noted that the move follows the Rafale’s strong performance during Operation Sindoor, where the aircraft reportedly outclassed Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missiles using its advanced Spectra electronic warfare suite. The Indian-built jets are expected to feature longer-range air-to-ground missiles than the Scalp used in Pakistan strikes.Dassault plans to establish a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility for Rafale’s M-88 engines in Hyderabad, complementing an existing maintenance firm in India.Indian partners such as Tata are likely to be involved in the production.The IAF sees the deal as crucial to bolstering its force structure alongside Su-30 MKIs, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark 1A, of which 180 have already been ordered, and the indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet planned for induction beyond 2035.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) wants to procure 114 ""Made in India"" Rafale fighter jets in collaboration with French manufacturer Dassault Aviation and Indian aerospace firms.

Earlier, the Ahmednagar district was renamed as Ahilyanagar district, PTI reported.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who had pursued the matter, thanked Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for granting the approval.Chief inmister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde were also involved in the efforts, a statement from Pawar’s office said.Last month, Pawar had written to Vaishnaw urging that the station be renamed to align with the city’s new name.“This long-pending demand has now been fulfilled. The renaming holds special significance as we are celebrating the 300th birth anniversary year of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar,” Pawar said.Several organisations and citizens had been demanding that the railway station’s name be changed after the city was renamed Ahilyanagar.Pawar also said efforts are underway to rename Aurangabad railway station as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station.Earlier, a similar thing was done by Karnataka government but that didn't go well with Fadnavis.

Suspense Grows in Nepal PM Race: Four Names, One Decision, A Nation on Edge

NEW DELHI: Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh on Friday said that Operation Sindoor , the punitive strike targeting terror bases in Pakistan, served as a “reality check” for India’s armed forces, highlighting areas where the country can improve its defence capabilities.Speaking at the Southern Command Defence Tech Seminar (STRIDE 2025), Singh noted that the operation revealed certain capability gaps, including in electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems, low-level radars and the need for a stronger ecosystem to manufacture military-grade drones capable of operating in GPS-denied and contested environments.“It's pretty clear in the context of the geopolitical situation now that most countries are paying a lot of attention to defence and hard power again. Given our neighborhood, India is no exception, and we've just had this experience with Operation Sindoor, which was in some ways a reality check for us in terms of where we can do better, where we need to adapt to changing needs for future warfare,” Singh said.In the context of military operation, defence secretary said that it highlighted certain capability gaps in the armed forces.These gaps included areas such as electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems and the need for a stronger manufacturing ecosystem for military-grade drones that can operate effectively in GPS-denied and contested environments.He also pointed to the requirement for improvements in low-level radar systems. Singh added that these were areas where the armed forces recognized the need to strengthen and enhance capabilities.The defence secretary also emphasised India’s push for indigenous defence production, highlighting that 88 per cent of defence capital expenditure in 2024 was spent within the country.When asked about solutions to address these capability gaps, Singh said the armed forces were given flexibility through emergency procurement rules to quickly acquire equipment needed immediately.For the long term, the focus remains on developing indigenous equipment in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Singh added that while short-term purchases from global suppliers may be necessary, the ultimate goal is to achieve fully indigenous capabilities across all areas.He also reaffirmed that DRDO would continue to work on indigenous alternatives for critical systems, ensuring self-reliance in defence production.The defence secretary praised India’s multi-layered air defence system, which performed effectively during military operation. He said the system prevented major losses or casualties despite repeated attempts by drones and missiles to penetrate it.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7 in response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. It was designed as a targeted campaign to dismantle terror infrastructure along and beyond the Line of Control , reflecting precision, professionalism and strategic purpose.","Rajesh Kumar Singh: Operation Sindoor served as a ‘reality check’ for India’s armed forces.

First launched at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here in June 2022, the program had added seven more airports — covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad — in January this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at five airports through video-conference, Shah said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the program and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in as little as 30 seconds and with no long queues or manual checks.“The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji’s vision of ‘speed, scale, and scope’ into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,” he said, adding that the program introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of Modi govt — from a little over 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 — Shah said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage. Stating that everyone who has availed of the program has voiced appreciation, the home minister said “our goal should be to ensure that every Indian citizen and every OCI cardholder takes advantage of this facility”.“To achieve this, I request that when issuing passports and OCI cards, we can also conduct this registration (under FTI-TTP), so that people don’t have to come twice for fingerprinting or document verification. Whenever they travel, they can simply use their passport. I think we must further explore the technological possibilities to maximize the number of people who can take advantage of this program,” he added.",FTI-TTP enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates.

However, Supreme Court on Friday ensured that the ""offence"" did not go unpunished by directing the VC to make the judgment, which recorded his alleged acts in detail, part of his resume.A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Prasanna B Varale passed the peculiar order while dismissing the plea filed by the faculty member. The court noted that the last instance of alleged sexual harassment had taken in April 2023 but the ""victim"" lodged a formal complaint in Dec 2023 with the local complaint committee which rejected the complaint as 'time barred' since it was not only beyond the prescribed period of limitation of three months but also beyond the extendable period of limitation of six months.Section 9 of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act says that any aggrieved woman may make a complaint to LCC within a period of three months from the date of incident, and in the case of series of incidents, within a period of three months from the date of the last incident. The second proviso to Section 9 provides that the LCC may for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the time of making the complaint not exceeding three months.Noting that nothing could be done in the case, the bench, however, ensured that the alleged wrong acts are not forgotten. ""It is advisable to forgive the wrongdoer, but not to forget the wrongdoing. The wrong which has been committed against the appellant (faculty member) may not be investigated on technical grounds, but it must not be forgotten. In this view of the matter, we direct that the incidents of alleged sexual harassment on part of respondent No. 1 (VC) may be forgiven but allowed to haunt the wrongdoer forever. Thus, it is directed that this judgment shall be made part of the resume of respondent No. 1, compliance of which shall be strictly ensured by him personally,"" the court said in its order.The complainant had alleged that the VC repeatedly used to call her in his office and proposed to her to go out for dinner. She had told him that she was not comfortable and wanted to keep the relationship professional only but he went on demanding ""sexual favour from her and threatened her if the offers were declined.""""A plain reading of the entire complaint would reveal that the sexual harassment, if any, of the appellant at the hands of respondent no. 1 commenced sometime in Sept 2019, and the last incident in that connection took place in April 2023. Thereafter, no incident of sexual harassment is alleged to have taken place except for the fact that on Aug 29, 2023, the appellant was removed from the post of director, Centre of Financial, Regulatory and Governance Studies (CFRGS) or that a preliminary inquiry was instituted against her by the executive council,"" the court said while holding that subsequent actions of removing her as director could not be in any way linked to sexual harassment to make her plea within the time limitation.","A sexual harassment complaint by a faculty member of West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences against its vice chancellor (VC) could not be looked into because it was not lodged within the mandatory three-month period.

No Trump Effect? India-EU Trade Deal Will Usher in Shared Prosperity and Balanced Growth, Says Goyal

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union Friday said that they are working intensely to finalise the trade deal by year-end, with commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal suggesting that some strategic elements may be part of the overall arrangement in the coming months.""We've been negotiating this for quite some time, but I can tell you that it never got such a momentum as we have right now, between minister Goyal and myself, and of course, having a strong political support from both leaders, Prime Minister Modi and President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen...

Amid the ongoing trade tensions, this week, negotiators from the two sides have been engaged in discussions to narrow the gaps, with Goyal and Sefcovic seeking to find solutions on contentious issues at their level.The two sides have been negotiating a trade deal for nearly two decades but have moved swiftly this year.Goyal said he has spent ""long hours of jostling and fighting"" with Sefcovic. ""I can tell you, he is a tough negotiator, very difficult to get anything past Maros... Every agreement has some give and take to make it a balanced agreement. There can never be a perfect situation and we all agree we should not make the perfect the enemy of the good.

Are crackers the primary source of pollution? Or is it because the Delhiites are elite? Or is it because the Supreme Court is situated in Delhi that it can be easily approached and a ban can be sought on crackers citing pollution?""

In a Ted Talk, Chhokar admitted to spending three months trying to convince Sastry that professors like them shouldn't get involved in such things. But eventually he stepped in. In 1999, ADR filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on the matter.

Jaishankar’s Big Message At BRICS Virtual Summit: Protect Global South From Tariffs & Trade Wars

Unfazed by the uncertainty hanging over the proposed summit in November, Quad cooperation at the ground level remains intact with the focus this month on counterterrorism workshops.These will include a technical exchange on misuse of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)/ drones by terrorists and a seminar on preventing terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technologies including for terror-financing.India has taken note of US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor’s remarks during his confirmation hearing that President Donald Trump remains committed to a meeting of Quad leaders and to strengthen the strategic grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US that acts as a bulwark against threats to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Trump’s efforts to mend ties with China, including through a landmark trade deal under discussion, have been seen as possible impediments in Quad’s progress even though the foreign ministers have met twice since Trump returned to the White House.The technical exchange on misuse of drones will be conducted by the National Security Guard (NSG) on September 23-24 at the NSG Garrison in Manesar. “The exercise will focus on identification of evolving UAS, framework for international cooperation by sharing best practices, subject matter expert exchange and refined national level policies for countering terrorist use of UAS or drones,” said a source, on condition of anonymity.It’s important for India that counterterrorism remains a priority for Quad, as evident from its strong condemnation of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack in the foreign ministers’ meeting in Washington in July. While India would have liked a swifter response in the days that followed the attack but the fact that the condemnation eventually came in the strongest possible terms and called for the “perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay” was significant for India.The Quad seminar on terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technology will be hosted by the NIA on September 26. It will address, according to official sources,emerging threat from terrorists by exploitation of new emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, deepfake technologies, encrypted chat platformand metaverse.“It aims to strengthen countermeasures against these threats, collaboration among Quad members through intelligence sharing, capacity building and engaging institutions and research organisations to develop safeguardsagainst misuse by terrorists,” said an official.Looking to boost India-Pacific security and prosperity, Quad will also formally launch its Ports of the Future Partnership next month with India hosting a transportation and logistics conference in Mumbai. According to a White House factsheet, the initiative will complement the work Quad partners have done to boost infrastructure expertise across the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships Program.While basic Quad cooperation continues, bilateral defence collaboration with the US seems to have escaped unscathed from the downturn in India-US ties. Three AH-64E Apache attack helicopters were delivered to the Indian Army in Julyand the US has committed to delivering 3 more in November. General Electric (GE) 404 engine delivery for India’s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme is also underway, according to sources.

NEW DELHI: Observing that the plight of tax-paying middle-class homebuyers presents a disheartening picture as their ""dream home"" has been reduced to an unfinished building despite paying EMIs, SC Friday said govt cannot remain a silent spectator to the woes faced by lakhs of homebuyers across the country and appealed to Centre to infuse funds in stalled housing projects and also consider taking over such projects.A bench of justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said that right to housing is not merely a contractual entitlement, but a facet of the fundamental right to life. Their protection is a constitutional obligation and govt must ensure that the dreams of India's citizens of having their own home does not turn into a lifelong nightmare, it added.The court also asked Centre to consider establishing a revival fund under NARCL or expanding the SWAMIH Fund.The State carries a constitutional obligation to create and strictly enforce a framework wherein no developer is permitted to defraud or exploit homebuyers. Ensuring timely project completion must be a cornerstone of India's urban policy. Equally, the State must proactively address the menace of a parallel cash economy and speculative practices in the real estate market, which artificially inflate housing costs and enable 'trigger-happy' investors seeking easy exits to jeopardise the interests of genuine end-users,"" the bench said.In view of increasing number of real estate housing projects across the country coming under insolvency proceedings which has left lakhs of homebuyers in the lurch with uncertainty over getting possession of these houses, SC said the Centre may consider establishing a body corporate, on the lines of National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd or otherwise, promoted by real estate/ construction-focused PSUs or through public-private partnerships, to identify, take over, and complete stalled projects under the IBC framework.It said home is not merely a roof over one's head, but a reflection of one's hopes and dreams which must be protected by govt.""The plight of tax-paying middle-class citizens paints a disheartening picture. Having invested their lifelong savings in pursuit of a home, many are compelled to shoulder a double burden - servicing EMIs on one hand, and paying rent on the other - only to find their dream home reduced to an unfinished building. In some cases, construction has not even commenced despite full or substantial payment,"" it said.""The Union govt shall consider establishing a revival fund under NARCL or expanding the SWAMIH Fund, to provide bridge financing for stressed projects undergoing CIRP, thereby preventing liquidation of viable projects and safeguarding homebuyer interests. Under SWAMIH Fund initiative, every rupee must be utilised strictly for its intended purpose of last-mile financing. To prevent misuse, we direct that a comprehensive periodic performance audit by the CAG be carried out,"" it said.","Supreme Court asks Centre to infuse funds in stalled housing projects and also consider taking over such projects.

New Delhi: Launching the 'fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme' (FTI-TTP), which enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates, at five more international airports in the country, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday suggested that its coverage be maximised by enabling resident Indians and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) to sign up for FTI-TTP at the state of issuing of passports or OCI cards itself.With the inclusion of Lucknow, Amritsar, Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchirappalli and Kozhikode international airports, the number of airports covered under the programme has risen to 13.First launched at the Delhi international airport in June 2022, the programme added seven more airports - covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad - in Jan this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at the five airports through video-conference, the home minister said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the programme and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in 30 seconds, with no long queues or manual checks.""The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating PM Narendra Modi's vision of 'speed, scale, and scope' into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,"" he said, adding the programme also introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of the Modi govt - from 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 - the home minister said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage.Shah said everyone who has availed of the programme has voiced appreciation. ""Our goal should be to ensure that every Indian citizen and every OCI cardholder takes advantage of this facility,"" he added.""To achieve this, I request that when issuing passports and OCI cards, we can also conduct this registration (under FTI-TTP), so that people don't have to come twice for fingerprinting or document verification.

Baiju Bhatt: Indian-American Robinhood co-founder and youngest US billionaire



Baiju Bhatt: From Gujarati immigrant roots to overcoming family hardships



Baiju Bhatt’s wealth and Robinhood’s rise



Also Read |





An Indian-American entrepreneur, Baiju Bhatt, has been recognised among the 10 youngest billionaires in the United States on the 2025 Forbes 400 list. Co-founder of the innovative stock trading platform Robinhood, Bhatt is the only person of Indian origin in this elite group. At 40, he joins other notable young billionaires, including Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, 41, and Walmart heir Luke Walton, 38, highlighting his remarkable achievement in the world of finance and technology-driven innovation.Bhatt’s fortune primarily comes from his continued equity stake in Robinhood, a platform that has revolutionized commission-free stock and crypto trading while empowering millions of retail investors worldwide. His inclusion underscores his significant impact as a self-made billionaire shaping the US financial and fintech landscape, while also inspiring future generations of entrepreneurs seeking global recognition and success.Baiju Bhatt, 40, is a trailblazing Indian-American entrepreneur and co-founder of Robinhood, a platform that has democratized stock and cryptocurrency trading. Bhatt’s journey with Robinhood began at Stanford University, where he met Vlad Tenev, his future co-founder.Together, they launched the financial services platform in 2013, aiming to make investing accessible to everyone, eliminating traditional brokerage fees.Bhatt served as co-CEO alongside Tenev until 2020 before transitioning to the role of Chief Creative Officer. In 2024, he stepped down from day-to-day executive responsibilities but remained an active member of Robinhood’s board of directors, retaining his 6% equity stake. Over the past year, Robinhood stock surged 400%, driven by increased crypto trading, expansion into IRAs, high-yield savings accounts, and record-breaking revenues of $3 billion in 2024.From the son of Indian immigrants facing financial struggles to a billionaire shaping the future of fintech, Baiju Bhatt represents a new generation of young Indian-American innovators redefining wealth creation in the United States.Bhatt is the son of Gujarati immigrants who moved to the United States when his father was accepted into a PhD program at the University of Huntsville, Alabama. Growing up in the small town of Poquoson, Virginia, Bhatt followed in his father’s academic footsteps, studying physics at Stanford University. He later earned a master’s degree in mathematics from the same institution in 2008.His background reflects a story of dedication, resilience, and the classic immigrant pursuit of the American dream. Bhatt’s path to success was far from easy. In interviews, he has shared that his family endured severe financial challenges, particularly after his father was diagnosed with kidney failure. Beginning when Baiju was only five years old, his father had to undergo extensive medical treatments, forcing him to leave his PhD studies to manage mounting expenses.As an only child, Bhatt often felt powerless watching his father struggle with health and finances. The family’s hardships were so significant that they couldn’t afford trips back to India, with their last visit recorded in 1997. Despite these obstacles, Bhatt transformed early challenges into motivation, ultimately co-founding Robinhood and amassing a fortune that now places him among the youngest US billionaires of Indian origin.According to Forbes, his current net worth is $6 billion, largely attributed to the 6% stake he continues to hold in Robinhood. This primarily stems from his Robinhood equity stake, which remains a significant portion of his financial portfolio. Robinhood’s success has been fueled by its disruptive approach to commission-free trading, a surge in cryptocurrency transactions, and expansion into new financial products like IRAs and high-yield savings accounts.The company’s remarkable growth trajectory, with record revenues of $3 billion in 2024, has solidified Bhatt’s standing as a billionaire and positioned him as a notable figure among Indian-origin tech entrepreneurs in America.Even after stepping down from executive duties, Bhatt’s continued influence on Robinhood demonstrates his lasting impact on the financial services sector. His story is a testament to resilience, innovation, and the power of entrepreneurial vision.","Baiju Bhatt, 40, is a trailblazing Indian-American entrepreneur and co-founder of Robinhood, a platform that has democratized stock and cryptocurrency trading.

Tata Electronics chip plant has a 'problem' and it is how to deal with Snakes and Elephants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tata-electronics-chip-plant-has-a-problem-and-it-is-how-to-deal-with-snakes-and-elephants/articleshow/123847209.cms,"Why 'Elephant-proof' wall

Snake problem





Tata Electronics semiconductor manufacturing is encountering an unexpected challenge in the forests of Assam. As Tata Electronics constructs its new chip assembly facility, it is not only about ensuring meeting technical complexities of microchip production but also with the region’s wildlife, particularly Elephants and Snakes.According to a report in the Economic Times, the company is building a massive “Elephant-Proof” wall around its upcoming outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district. The project, which is one of the most significant under the Rs 76,000-crore India Semiconductor Mission, is receiving proactive support from the Assam state government to address these unique logistical challenges.The need for an elephant-proof wall is not just about preventing damage to equipment. Experts told Economic Times that the concern lies in the ground vibrations caused by the elephants' heavy tread. In the world of semiconductor manufacturing, where dimensions are measured in nanometers, even a minor vibration can be catastrophic.“Ground vibrations can cause misalignments in precision equipment, leading to inaccurate measurements, distorted patterns, operational failures and ultimately faulty chips,” the report states.A semiconductor industry veteran told the publication that while vibrations are not a major concern for all OSAT plants, they pose a significant threat to ""fine-pitch assembly,"" a process requiring extremely high precision. “If the vibration shifts it even by half a micron, every pin will get shifted by half a micron, the alignment will go and Tata Electronics may lose yield,” the veteran said.In addition to the elephant problem, the plant is also dealing with an abundance of Snakes. The company has hired a team of rescuers who work full-time to capture and safely relocate the reptiles. ""These people have been there for the last three months and since then have rescued many snakes,"" a source told the newspaper.The state government is taking an active role in supporting the project. According to a state official quoted, the wall is being built ""not just for the elephants but for their security as well.” The official noted that the chief minister, industry department, and chief secretary are personally overseeing the project, ensuring the Tata Group receives full support.The new chip assembly plant, which involves an investment of Rs 27,000 crore, is attracting high-profile attention, with Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly being a key prospective customer.Experts say that industries such as semiconductor manufacturing require strict vibration control as instruments and processes demand high stability and accuracy to function correctly. Proper foundation design and structural engineering are among the initial defences against vibration.",Tata Electronics is building a 'Elephant-Proof' wall around its upcoming semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district of Assam.

In Bengaluru, Mouli ran several small businesses, the most successful being a PG accommodation. Neighbours in RT Nagar remembered him as soft-spoken, humble and generous.Mouli moved to the United States in 2018, initially living in San Antonio before settling in Dallas, where he managed a motel for the past five years. He often spoke of his dream to expand a hospitality business with his sister and brother-in-law, who already run a venture in Texas.Friends described him as gentle, hardworking and family-oriented. His classmate Sailas Nulaka called him “the humblest friend” he had known, while another friend, Abilash Reddy, said his family was well respected in Bengaluru. Two years ago, Mouli’s family renovated their Bengaluru home and converted it into a PG, with neighbours remembering them as kind and welcoming.His 18-year-old son, Gaurav, is preparing to study hospitality management, aiming to carry forward his father’s dream.Mouli was killed on 10 September at the Dallas motel where he worked, reportedly in front of his wife and son. Police said he was attacked with a machete by his co-worker, 37-year-old Cuban national Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, following an argument over translating instructions about a broken washing machine. Officers said the accused later threw Mouli’s head into a dumpster. Cobos-Martinez has been arrested and charged with capital murder.Mouli had planned to visit India in October to meet his mother and sibling. His family in India is expected to travel to Dallas for the funeral.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

India to need 2L staff for EV charging by 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-need-2l-staff-for-ev-charging-by-2030/articleshow/123862789.cms,"ANI image





BENGALURU: Tata Power inaugurated Mumbai’s first premium MegaCharger hub near the city airport on Tuesday, adding to its 1,000-plus charging points in the city. The facility, developed with Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, features eight fast DC chargers with 16 bays, aiming to cut wait times for private and fleet EV users.However, as infrastructure expands, a shortage of skilled manpower threatens to slow momentum. A recent whitepaper by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India estimates that India will need between 1 lakh and 2 lakh trained professionals by 2030 to manage charging stations.The whitepaper highlighted the critical role of charge point operators (CPOs), who form the backbone of this infrastructure, in India's transition to electric mobility. It identified the lack of hands-on training opportunities, standardised training modules for CPOs, and the shortage of qualified trainers who understand both technical and operational aspects of EV charging infrastructure among the top barriers in skilling CPOs.Public charging points grew sharply, from just 25 in 2015 to nearly 30,000 by August. Yet, to meet the government's target of a 1:40 charger-to-EV ratio, the country must add about 400,000 new chargers every year this decade.That scale-up, experts say, cannot happen without a parallel build-out of human capital. Exicom’s Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment unit CEO Anshuman Divyanshu told TOI that the skill challenge is no longer limited to basic electrical work. The role of a charging technician now cuts across high-voltage systems, software, and connectivity.“Fast, reliable charging infrastructure is at the heart of India’s EV transition. But that ambition will ultimately be measured not just in megawatts installed, but in the expertise that keeps those megawatts running reliably,” he said.Divyanshu added that Exicom invested in structured training because, as he put it, “the pace of talent readiness still lags deployment.” In his view, building a talent pool has to run in parallel with hardware installation if adoption is to accelerate at scale. Kazam founder and CEO Akshay Shekhar described the realities outside metro markets as mixed.Finding electricians through ITIs or local institutes was not difficult, he said, but specialised EV skills remained limited. “Many avoid critical but labour-intensive tasks like earthing, and not all are consistent with SOPs,” he told TOI.Shekhar also pointed out that technicians in tier-2 and tier-3 cities often lacked exposure to quality standards, soft skills, and even the basics of using proper tool kits. Despite these gaps, Shekhar said there was a strong willingness to learn. He cited Kazam’s training of more than 500 technicians in smaller cities, many of whom are now supporting industry growth.“With the right training and certification, this workforce can truly become the backbone of India’s EV charging rollout,” he said. The TERI-MBRDI study highlighted that most Industrial Training Institutes still lack EV-specific curricula, forcing charge point operators to rely on in-house skilling.It warns that gaps in diagnostics, safety standards, and digital integration could slow India’s ability to sustain its infrastructure build-out. India’s EV sector is projected to create 1 crore direct jobs and 5 crore indirect jobs by 2030. Industry voices caution that unless technician training keeps pace with charger deployment, the risk is not under-investment in hardware, but under-preparedness in the workforce needed to keep that hardware running.The expansion of the EV charging network will take place in a staggered and predictable manner, giving enough time to train manpower. Many of the required skill sets already exist in adjacent sectors,” said Kunal Khattar, founding partner of AdvantEdge.He added that charging infrastructure is likely to see lower operating costs over time as technology enables unmanned stations. Petrol pumps, he said, could play a key role in scaling the network. “They can add charge points as demand rises, and since they already have manpower on site, there is no incremental investment required,” Khattar noted.","Tata Power inaugurated Mumbai’s first premium MegaCharger hub near the city airport on Tuesday.

Retail inflation inches up to 2.1% in August,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/retail-inflation-inches-up-to-2-1-in-august/articleshow/123862800.cms,"



New Delhi: Retail inflation inched up in Aug, led by some hardening in prices of meat and fish, oils and fats, personal care & effects and eggs, but remained in the comfort zone which may prompt RBI to maintain a pause on interest rates for now.Data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Friday showed retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 2.1% in Aug, up from 1.6% in July but below the 3.7% in Aug last year. There is an increase of 46 basis points in inflation in Aug, compared to July, while food inflation during the month was up by 107 basis points compared to July.Rural inflation was at 1.7% during Aug, a tad higher than the 1.2% in July while urban inflation was higher at 2.5%, up from 2.1% in the previous month.Oils and fats increased at 21.2% during Aug while fruits rose 11.7%. Personal care and effects remained in double digits at 16.6%. Pulses and products contracted 14.5% and vegetables fell 15.9% during the month.""Food's exit from deflation (0% vs -0.8%) and an uptick in core inflation (4.2% vs 4.1%) pulled up the consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation to 2.1% in Aug,"" said D K Joshi, chief economist at ratings agency Crisil.""Given the lower-than-expected food inflation and the expected easing of core inflation in the coming months due to the reduction in the goods and services tax, we have revised our inflation forecast down to 3.2% from 3.5% for this fiscal,"" said Joshi. Experts expect RBI to maintain its pause on interest rates.","Rural inflation was at 1.7% during Aug, a tad higher than 1.2% in July.

Late Sunjay Kapur's wife Priya attends top business meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/late-sunjay-kapurs-wife-priya-attends-top-business-meet/articleshow/123862741.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Amid the family feud over control of late Sunjay Kapur's business empire following his sudden demise, his wife Priya Sachdev Kapur attended a top meeting of auto component manufacturers association (Acma) in the national capital on a special invitation.Priya attended the meeting in her capacity as director of Aureus Investment (AIPL) - the family investment office of Kapur - which holds the promoter stake in the component company Sona Comstar. ""She was a special invitee to the executive committee meeting after being called for the event by Acma president Vikrampati Singhania,"" a source said.Her presence at the event is seen as symbolically crucial, pitching her as the main representative of Sunjay's estate. In brief comments at a closed-door meeting, Priya told the industry captains that she would be happy to shoulder any responsibility that the industry body entrusts her with.The annual session of Acma began with a tribute to Kapur as the industry body held a remembrance in honour of its past president. Priya was in the hall as industry stalwarts remembered the business leader, who was the chairman of Sona Comstar at the time of his death.The Kapur clan has been in a bitter family feud after his passing away in June, especially after Priya was appointed as a director of AIPL and also as a non-executive director of Sona Comstar.Sunjay's mother Rani Kapur and one of his sisters Mandhira Kapur have alleged that with Priya taking charge as a director of both AIPL and Sona Comstar, she had taken control of the entire wealth of the family, which is estimated at around Rs 30,000 crore. Rani has alleged that Priya had usurped Sunjay's estate, leaving her with nothing.The matter has become even more complex with Sunjay's ex-wife Karisma Kapur also taking the legal route as she approached the Delhi High Court, seeking a share in the family's estate for her two children (through the marriage with Sunjay). Karisma and Sunjay married in 2003 but got divorced in 2016.The court on Sept 10 had directed Priya to disclose all movable and immovable assets belonging to Sunjay as of June 12, the day of his death during a Polo match in the UK.","Priya Sachdev Kapur attended a top meeting of auto component manufacturers association.
