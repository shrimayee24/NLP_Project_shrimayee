Residents fear the worst as desilting work lags in Delhi

Poll Should the deadline for desilting work be extended to ensure completion before the monsoon? No, it should stay as is Yes, it should be extended

NEW DELHI: MCD's status report for desilting of drains reveals that the civic body completed only 21.3% of the work by April 25. With the initial deadline for finishing the work set for May 31, the progress so far appears insufficient.Of the target of 1.3 lakh metric tonnes to be lifted and taken to designated sites by May end, only 27,000 MT was cleared from drains more than 4 feet deep, as per the report.The civic body didn't comment on the issue while several RWAs reported that no desilting had taken place in their localities. To meet the target, the pace needs to be significantly increased, they said. Desilting is done in two phases. Phase I is carried out before monsoon from Jan 1 to May 31, when 60% of the cleaning is done to mitigate the chances of waterlogging during the rainy season.The deadline for this is often extended to June 15. Phase II of the work is taken up post-monsoon to ensure uninterrupted flow of drains.The civic body is working in all 12 zones in the capital after engaging machinery and equipment. There are 800 drains over 4ft deep in MCD's jurisdiction, spread over a 530km area.As of now, work is on at 253 places, while work at none of the drains has been completed yet.""In phase I, the civic body targeted to lift 1,29,392.8 metric tonnes of silt, and of this, 27,589 MT of silt was removed by April 25, which amounts to 21.3%,"" as per the report seen by TOI.In phase II this year, the silt removal target has been set at 84,466.6 MT. This has taken the total target of MCD for removing silt in 2025-26 to 2,13,859.5 MT.Besides, work is on at drains in the residential colonies in the capital and those less than 4ft deep.""These drains are cleared throughout the year. There are 12,892 such drains spread over an area of 6,069.8km, with a target to remove 40,086 MT of silt. Of this, 9,474.8 MT has been achieved by the end of April, which accounts for 24% of the work,"" said the report.According to the report, 100% of the work has been done in Sadar Paharganj zone, followed by 57% in Najafgarh zone and 44.8% in Keshavpuram.Residents, however, said that the Friday morning downpour, accompanied by gusty winds, exposed the lack of preparedness of the Delhi govt and the municipal authorities.""Widespread waterlogging affected the city, particularly at known trouble spots. Internal lanes of New Friends Colony, Janakpuri and Azadpur were also flooded. I think authorities need to fix the problem and complete their task in coordination rather than later blaming each other for waterlogging,"" said A N Gupta, a resident of Janakpuri.MCD reported 16 complaints of waterlogging from Vasant Vihar, Defence Colony, Pul Bangash, Fatehpur Beri, Shastri Bagh and Rana Pratap Bagh on Friday.""Complaints were received through email, call centre and hotline numbers. These were immediately conveyed to the staff and resolved,"" said the official.","MCD's status report for desilting of drains reveals that the civic body completed only 21.3% of the work by April 25.

FMs reluctant to give up taxation powers

NEW DELHI: A bottle of alcohol that costs Rs 100 in Goa will set you back by Rs 305 in neighbouring Karnataka, Rs 229 in Telangana and Rs 205 in Rajasthan.The massive price variation is due to the different levels of excise duty and other taxes that states levy, with the trend of Goa having the lowest levies remaining unchanged. If anything, taxes in Goa have inched up compared to a few years ago. Goa levies the lowest excise of 55%, while the tax rises 80% in Karnataka, the highest in the country, according to data compiled by International Spirits & Wine Association of India.As a result, a bottle of popular Black Label whisky costs Rs 3,310 a bottle in Delhi, Rs 4,200 in Mumbai and around Rs 5,200 in Karnataka.The difference in duties defeats the 'one nation, one tax' principle, with finance ministers making no effort to correct the situation, amid calls from industry to rationalise taxes. It also results in states with higher taxes losing revenue to bootlegging.For instance, individuals in Delhi often hop across to Haryana to purchase alcohol as is the case in Tamil Nadu, where many people purchase liquor from Puducherry.With excise on liquor and VAT on petrol and diesel being the only major sources of revenue for states after the introduction of goods and services tax, finance ministers are reluctant to give up further taxation powers, especially in a season of freebies, when the tax is used to bridge the deficit.""While we recognise that the states have to augment their revenues, there is a need to build a sustainable model which focuses on stability and allows consumers to uptrade through premiumisation. This can be achieved through tax rationalisation and creating a pricing ladder that allows consumers to uptrade, thereby building the ethos of drink less, drink better. We have seen revenue growth in the past in states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where price correction through tax rationalisation has helped in incremental revenue growth that is sustainable,"" said Sanjit Padhi, CEO, ISWAI, the industry lobby representing global giants.Rival body Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Industry too has said that different tax levels across states is a big challenge for the industry. ""There is no cohesive strategy for the Indian alcoholic beverage industry. The industry needs a uniform taxation mechanism which will propel the growth,"" CIABC's Deepak Roy said recently.","A bottle of alcohol that costs Rs 100 in Goa will set you back by Rs 305 in neighbouring Karnataka.

"2 years on, Telangana gig workers' Bill catches Rajasthan's landmark law 'napping'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-years-on-telangana-gig-workers-bill-catches-rajasthans-landmark-law-napping/articleshow/120880033.cms,"2 years on, T’gana gig workers’ Bill catches Raj’s landmark law ‘napping’

Poll Do you support the implementation of social security for gig workers in Rajasthan? No Yes

JAIPUR: Congress-governed Telangana's draft Gig and Platform Workers (Registration, Social Security, and Welfare) Bill is reigniting a conversation that the party's erstwhile stronghold, Rajasthan, once led - only to let the momentum slip.As the desert state's pioneering 2023 Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act lies entangled in red tape, bike taxi rider Krishna Kumar Chaudhary wakes up each morning knowing exactly how his day will end - exhausted, barely breaking even, and unable to secure a better future for his son.For thousands like him in Rajasthan's gig economy , the 2023 law signalled hope that has since evaporated in the cycle of political transition, bureaucratic delay, and corporate pressures.Krishna Kumar, general secretary of the Rajasthan Gig and App-based Workers' Union, earns Rs 700-1,000 daily ferrying passengers on his motorbike. After accounting for platform fees (Rs 100), petrol (Rs 300 approx) and maintenance (Rs 100), he is left with a maximum of Rs 400.""My room rent alone is Rs 4,000 a month. I borrow from friends to survive. I want my son to study in a private school, but I can't afford it,"" Kumar says.Gul Mohammed Mansoori, 50, works for a goods transport company that operates through a platform and leaves drivers to fend for themselves when customers don't pay.""The platforms deduct a 12% commission on each trip but take no responsibility for non-payment of dues. Drivers are asked to pursue customers for payments. I earn around Rs 3,000 a week and occasionally Rs 5,000 - but that's not enough,"" he tells TOI.Mansoori makes Jaipuri quilts, especially during the lean season, to earn a few thousand extra rupees.Rajasthan's attempt to legislate protection was the first such initiative in the country, promising social and financial security for an estimated five lakh employees driving the state's Rs 25,000-crore gig economy.Enacted by the then Ashok Gehlot govt, it aimed to create a welfare board, establish a Rs 200-crore welfare fund, and impose a 2% cess on aggregators to provide health and accident insurance, pensions, provident fund, and school education for children of workers,The Bhajan Lal Sharma led-BJP govt announced an allocation of Rs 350 crore in this year's state Budget to the Gig and Unorganised Workers Development Fund, a Rs 100-crore increase over last year's outlay. It remains unclear when the corpus will be created, or how the benefits will reach the intended targets.Home minister Amit Shah's announcement of a cooperative framework for 50 lakh app-based drivers nationwide has rekindled a semblance of hope.The model, allowing registration of two-wheelers, taxis, rickshaws, and four-wheelers, aims for democratic management and equitable profit distribution among drivers.Under the umbrella of the National Campaign for Cooperatives in Platform and Transport Economy, gig workers are also in talks with the Union cooperatives ministry for a taxi cooperative called ""Sahkar Taxi"" that will enable drivers to operate as entrepreneurs without having to pay commissions to existing platform service-providers.NITI Aayog projects India's gig economy will grow to 2.35 crore workers by 2029-30. Gig unions, like the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), propose funding social security through taxes, cess, CSR, platform contributions, and more. IFAT's national general secretary, Shaik Salauddin, says home minister Shah's cooperative model must involve workers to avoid replicating exploitative practices. ""We need driver-led models that prioritise rights over profits. We are ready to collaborate for a true alternative.""Jaipur taxi driver Suresh Prajapati, 26, awaits the day workers like him don't have to depend on platforms. ""If driving is your only source of income, relying on Ola or Uber won't suffice. I make ends meet by building my base of personal customers. I have registered with the Centre's e-Shram portal in the hope that there will be some benefits someday.""","Rajasthan's pioneering 2023 Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers Act lies entangled in red tape.

Poll Do you support the challenges against the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025? No, I do not support the challenges. Yes, I support the challenges.

Government: Waqf law rivals spreading falsehood

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court will decide on Monday whether and what interim order could be passed on petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, on the ground that its provisions interfered with the traditional and historic link of waqfs with Islam and violated Article 26 which guarantees freedom of religious affairs.A three-judge bench headed by CJI Sanjiv Khanna , who is scheduled to retire on May 13, has limited time to take up final hearing of the matter as it would require hearing many lawyers from the petitioners' side and the Union govt, which as an interim response to the petitions has filed an over 1,300-page affidavit.The court had picked five lead petitions from the over 150 and named them as 'In Re: The Waqf Amendment Act' to restrict the number of advocates who could argue for the petitioners. Even then, the hearing on the necessity of interim order could be time consuming as every counsel on the petitioners side has so far promised to make a new point and sought an opportunity to argue.Defending the Act as a secular law, the Centre on Friday accused the petitioners of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" narrative on mandatory registration of every waqf, including 'waqf by user', and said this provision was more than a century old. Ministry of minority affairs in a 1,332-page affidavit has requested the SC to fall back on the traditional assumption of validity of the law enacted by Parliament and conduct a detailed hearing without granting any stay on operation of the law which is to stop misuse of the 2013 amendment which the govt says allowed encroachment of private and govt properties.The ministry requested the SC, which had flagged three issues in the 2025 law - registration documents of waqf properties, inclusion of non-Muslims in Waqf Council and Waqf Boards and determination of govt land - for an equitable approach by arguing that though challenge to the validity of Waqf Act, 1995, was pending for a long time, the court had never contemplated staying certain provisions of the 30-year-old law.""Till 2013, the total area under waqf was 18.3 lakh acres. It is really shocking to note that after 2013, another 20.9 lakh acres of land were added to waqfs, which totalled 39.2 lakh acres,"" the ministry had said.","Supreme Court will decide on Monday whether and what interim order could be passed on petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025.

No, I have my doubts. Yes, absolutely!

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) - the country's premier agriculture research organisation - has developed the world's first genome-edited improved varieties of rice to boost yields by 20-30%, conserve water and reduce emission of methane - a potent greenhouse gas.Releasing the two genome-edited varieties - ' DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' and ' Pusa DST Rice 1 ' - Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said these two climate-resilient and high yielding varieties would ensure a second green revolution in the country. He instructed ICAR officials to make these seeds available to farmers at the earliest.""Scientists are currently in the process of getting Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of these two varieties. Certified seeds will reach farmers for cultivation in minimum two years,"" said an official.Genome-editing, particularly the CRISPR-Cas technology , is being recognised as a breakthrough in precision breeding. It enables scientists to make targeted changes in the native genes of living organisms, and creating new and desirable traits without introducing foreign DNA.ICAR claimed that the cultivation of these improved rice varieties in about five million hectares of the recommended area will produce 4.5 million tons of additional paddy, save a minimum 7,500 million cubic meters of irrigation water due short-duration maturity (20 days early), and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. ""Development of these two varieties using genome-editing technology has paved the way for using this innovative method in other crops too for higher yields, climate resilience and improved quality to achieve the targets of 'Viksit Bharat',"" said an ICAR statement.Genome-edited 'Kamala' is recommended for cultivation across major rice-growing states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The other new variety - 'Pusa DST Rice 1' - is also recommended for cultivation in most of these states.Recognizing the transformative potential of the new technology, ICAR initiated a genome-editing research project in rice in 2018 and selected two widely cultivated mega rice varieties - 'Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204)' and 'MTU1010 (Cottondora Sannalu)' - to further enhance their qualities through technological interventions.ICAR scientists eventually enhanced these varieties with better stress tolerance, improved yield, and climate adaptability without compromising their existing strengths, and developed the two new genome-edited varieties 'Kamala' and 'Pusa DST Rice 1'.",The Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR) has developed the world's first genome-edited improved varieties of rice.

Dasmohapatra was questioned Sunday by Puri temple authorities as part of an ongoing government probe into the claims.""Action will be taken against those responsible if found guilty of illegally using Jagannath temple's sacred timber to build the idols of Digha Jagannath temple. Our CM (Mohan Majhi) will write to the Bengal government to stop branding Digha Jagannath temple as Jagannath Dham. This title is reserved for Puri, which is home to the main Jagannath temple,"" state law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said on Sunday.Mamata's TMC repudiated the objections. ""If they (BJP) question the establishment of a Hindu temple, this shows their desperation. On one hand, BJP claims to be a 'Hinduwadi' party, on the other, they are raising questions on the pratishtha (sanctity) of the (Digha) temple. If there is any question on the establishment, it should be asked by the four Shankaracharyas,"" TMC spokesperson Jay Prakash Majumdar said.Craftsmen from Puri temple have, however, dismissed claims that excess neem wood had been used to build the three idols of the Digha shrine. According to them, the surplus wood that had been stored after making the idols of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra during the 2015 Nabakalebara (creation of new idols) Rath Yatra, were too small, ranging between 3 and 10 inches, making them unsuitable for construction of the idols.Opposition BJD and Congress, meanwhile, have criticised BJP for allegedly failing to handle the situation. Senior Congress neta Niranjan Patnaik said it is a matter of grave concern as the issue involves emotional connect of 4.5 crore Odias to Lord Jagannath, the Jagannath Temple, and its culture. ""Odisha government must intervene to protect this heritage amid potential threats,"" Patnaik said.Former CM Naveen Patnaik's BJD criticised the state government's apparent lack of initiative in protecting Jagannath culture.

Part-time work to instil confidence: Principal

(Names changed to protect identities)

HYDERABAD: They may soar as tech whizkids in the future. But now, a band of female students is having to plumb the depths - as janitors, cleaning toilets of their own engineering college in Andhra Pradesh 's Guntur.Cleaning toilets is one of the chores Vani (name changed) must complete before heading to class at 9am, with the other tasks being watering plants or helping in the college kitchen. Reason? These part-time gigs allow Vani to pay for the hostel at the engineering college - something her daily wager parents cannot afford. The 21-year-old is currently in her final year of BTech in AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning).Turns out Vani's college has about a dozen such girl students - pursuing different branches of engineering - who have taken up similar works to keep their dreams of a higher education alive.And they are only too glad to be able to do so. ""I know my family's financial situation. I don't feel there is anything wrong with taking up any work that can ease the burden on them,"" Vani told TOI, adding that she did not want to be a burden on her parents.A resident of Bellamvaripalem in Guntur, Vani's father makes Rs 700 to Rs 800 a day, and her mother another Rs 250 at best. She started working in the third year of BTech after her parents borrowed money to clear her hostel fee.Vani's hostel fees are Rs 37,500 per year. ""I did not want them (her parents) to borrow again. That's why I approached the management asking if I could get some work. I never hesitated to clean restrooms, as we are the ones using them. It felt like keeping our house clean,"" Vani added, pointing out that she either works in the early hours before going to college or in the evening after returning from classes.Her batchmate Sravya has a similar routine. ""One week we work during the morning and the next week during the evenings. It takes around two to three hours to complete our work. Right from cleaning rooms, restrooms, and gardening, we take care of all work along with other staff,"" said the final-year AI student.Along with these tasks, this group also doubles as caretakers, waking up other students on time for study sessions and serving food, among other duties.Though these students admit to run-ins with seniors who question their authority at times (when they ask them to go for classes or turn off lights) they say it's a small price to pay for the returns.""My family was already in a Rs 3 lakh debt. So, I knew I had to do these jobs to stay afloat. Whenever I faced some resistance, I used to seek the help of authorities,"" said Aarti a first-year engineering student from Kurnool. Raised by a single mother, she said the family was willing to take any help that came their way, as seven siblings are completely dependent on their mother since their father passed away when she was in class 9.The principal of the college revealed that students were being encouraged to take up part-time work to instil confidence in them that they can take care of themselves. ""About 200 students come forward every year to do part-time work, but we consider only 8 to 10 of them who are serious. These are the ones who are generally in need and have a powerful mindset,"" the principal said.",Band of BTech students in Andhra forced to double up as janitors to pay for studies.

NEW DELHI: NEET-UG 2025 has recorded its lowest attendance since 2021, with National Testing Agency attributing this to stringent checks implemented from the registration phase to the conduct of exam to eliminate ""bogus"" candidates. The number of candidates who registered for the 2025 entrance exam for medical and allied UG courses also declined from the previous year.On Sunday, around 20.8 lakh candidates appeared for the test out of the 22.7 lakh who registered, recording an attendance of 91.4%, according to the agency, which said this could increase slightly as data from remote locations are yet to arrive.In 2024, 97.9% of the 24 lakh candidates who had registered for the exam appeared for it (the highest attendance ever for NEET-UG). The attendance was 97.6% in 2023, when for the first-time registration crossed the 20-lakh mark; in 2022, 94.2% of the 18.7 lakh registered candidates took the test; and in 2021, 95.6% of the 16.1 lakh registered candidates appeared for the exam.The test was held amid unprecedented security arrangements on Sunday, a day after drills were conducted at all centres to test operational readiness - including mobile signal jammers, availability of adequate frisking personnel and biometric authentication - as well as systems for multi-level monitoring and police escorts for transporting question papers from banks to the centres. State-wise, UP had the highest number of candidates (over 3.3 lakh), followed by Maharashtra (over 2.4 lakh) and Rajasthan (over 2 lakh). Over 51,000 candidates appeared from J&K, and among the northeastern states, Assam had more than 45,000 candidates and Manipur 10,198 candidates.This time, NTA set up 5,453 exam centres - more than last year - and priority was given to universities, colleges and govt or govt-aided schools.

The control room monitored all exam-related activities at the ground level.District administrations also conducted periodic reviews of security arrangements, including secure transportation of question papers, logistics management, and deployment of police personnel at the centres, the official said.Based on reports received through a special online portal, NTA has also taken action against multiple Telegram and Instagram channels spreading false information and misleading students.According to a senior NTA official, over 2,300 suspicious claims have been received so far, most linked to Telegram channels promoting false paper leak narratives.

This figure reveals a significant decrease as compared to his $226 million earnings of 2022.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee?

Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants.

Elon Musk says DOGE is a way of life

Elon Musk plans to keep his ‘tiny office’ in White House

Elon Musk on if DOGE has been effective

Elon Musk says he didn’t always like the job

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), a federal initiative aimed at reducing government spending and modernizing technology systems. Musk, who was serving as a special government employee, is transitioning from daily in-person engagements at the White House to remote participation. In an hour-long interview on Wednesday April 30, Musk told reporters “Now we’re getting more of a rhythm. And so the amount of time that it’s necessary for me to spend here is much less, and I can return to primarily running my companies, which do need me.”During the interview, Musk insisted that the transition does not mean that DOGE work is done. The task force which was originally set up to terminate on July 4, 2026, will reportedly continue till the end of 2028. Asked about the possibility of extending DOGE's mandate, Musk responded, ""I think so,"" adding, ""It's up to the president.”The Tesla CEO also compared DOGE to Buddhism, stating “It’s a way of life, like Buddhism”. When asked who will lead DOGE, Musk stated “You wouldn’t ask who would lead Buddhism.”Stating that during the “intense” three months of the Trump administration, he occasionally slept over at the White House at Trump’s invitation. Musk has frequently traveled with Trump in recent months. Sharing an exchange after such travels, Musk said: “He (Donald Trump) was like: 'Where are you staying?' I was like: 'I don't know. At a friend's house, I guess.' And then he was like: 'Why don't you stay here?' I was like: 'Sure.'”He would stay over in the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom where he occasionally played video games – Diablo and Path of Exile.Musk, during the interview, recalled that Trump once called him late at night and suggested he get ice cream from the White House kitchen. “He’ll actually call late at night and say, ‘Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,’” Musk said, jokingly adding “Don’t tell RFK.”During his tenure at White House, Musk told reporters that he was assigned an office on the top floor of the West Wing. Stating that he intends to keep the “comically tiny office”, he added that it's a tight space and gets only a ""glimmer of sunlight.""“It has a view of nothing,” he said. “It has a window but all you see is the HVAC unit, which is fine. It makes it harder to shoot me, I guess. There's not a good line of sight.”During the interview, Musk told the reporters that DOGE has cut $160 billion in federal spending which is far short of the $2 trillion goal he set last year. He said “In the grand scheme of things, I think we've been effective. Not as effective as I like ... but we've made progress.”He further added: “There's a long way to go. It's pretty difficult ... It's like: How much pain is the Cabinet and Congress willing to take? It can be done. But it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.”Musk also talked about the backlash DOGE faced for its actions and how his companies, especially Tesla became a target of protests and vandalism. He said “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun” adding ""Seeing cars on fire is not fun.""","Tesla CEO Elon Musk is scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency.

Pak Defence Minister Threatens To Strike Indian Water Projects, BJP Hits Back Strongly

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has threatened that his country will target any structure built by India on the Indus River if it goes against the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which New Delhi recently suspended after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Speaking on a programme of Pakistan News channelon Friday, Asif said, ""Certainly, if they (India) attempt to build any kind of structure, we will strike it.""He said that any construction on the Indus River would be seen as ""Indian aggression"" towards Pakistan.""Aggression is not just about firing cannons or bullets; it has many faces. One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst,"" he added.Asif also said, ""If they make any architectural attempt, then Pakistan will destroy that structure.""But for now, we are heading to forums available to us, starting from the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty]. We will pursue this matter.""This comes days after Asif said that the chances of conflict with India were increasing with the passage of time despite efforts by different countries to defuse the tensions between the two neighbours.""Chances (of conflict) are increasing with the passage of time; they are not decreasing. Though many countries have been trying to avert the situation,"" he said.Earlier, on April 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the people behind the Pahalgam terror attack and those supporting them will be punished.In a meeting on April 29 with senior defence officials, Modi said that the armed forces have ""complete operational freedom"" to choose how, when, and where to respond to the attack, news agency PTI reported quoting government sources.",Khawaja Asif says Pakistan will target any structure built by India on the Indus River if it goes against Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) This comes days after Asif said that the chances of conflict with India were increasing with the passage of time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120865886,imgsize-666740,width-400,resizemode-4/lknj-4.jpg"

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Trump’s first 100 Days: A chaotic start

""Saturday Night Live"" returned with a sharp mockery of President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office during its cold open this weekend. The sketch, which featured James Austin Johnson as Trump and Mikey Day as White House adviser Stephen Miller, took aim at Trump’s actions with comedic exaggerations, bringing attention to his controversial executive orders and decisions.Johnson, reprising his well-loved Trump impersonation, celebrated the milestone by showcasing his executive orders. He boasted about signing ""147 executive orders,"" which he claimed ranged from ""banning paper straws to defunding PBS."" One of the sketch’s most absurd moments was when Day, as Miller, introduced an order that would ""make it socially acceptable for a man in his 70s to date a 24-year-old,"" a nod to the relationship of Bill Belichick, the football coach, and his younger girlfriend.Other mock orders included making the New York Times game “Connections” easier, outlawing ghosts, and shortening the term ""recession"" to ""recess."" ""Recession will now be called ‘recess,’"" Johnson’s Trump said. ""America, get ready for a historically long recess!” The farcical sketch also saw Johnson signing a pardon for author JK Rowling and bringing back Columbus Day to protect ""great Italian-American friends"" like Tony Soprano and Childish Gambino.The skit poked fun at Trump’s often chaotic and divisive approach to governance, exaggerating his moves in office with wild and humorous orders that highlighted the unpredictability of his administration. ""SNL"" also used the cold open to comment on the stark contrast between Trump's early actions and past administrations, with a voiceover mocking Trump’s first 100 days by comparing him unfavourably to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who shaped modern America during his early days in office.Trump's first 100 days have been a whirlwind of policy changes and executive orders that have shocked both Americans and the global community. His aggressive tariff policies, shifting stance on foreign affairs, and controversial decisions on issues like immigration and climate change have stirred up confusion and uncertainty across the political spectrum.While the president has made bold moves in areas like trade and immigration, the impact has been mixed. Tariffs have raised concerns about increased costs for consumers, and his foreign policy, especially on Ukraine, has raised questions about America's international standing.

He revealed that only his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, were aware beforehand, while Greg Abel- seated beside him on stage- had no prior notice.While many investors believe Abel is well-suited to lead Berkshire Hathaway, questions remain about his investment acumen. Buffett reinforced his confidence in Abel by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.Further adding in his statement revealing that he'll retain his shareholding and lending support to Abel, the billionaire investor added, ""I have no intention - zero - of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually.""“The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,"" he further said, justifying his decision.Investors, numbering in thousands at the Omaha venue, rose to their feet in extended applause to honour Buffett's six-decade leadership of the company.CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert observed that Buffett's decision to step aside would not have been straightforward. ""This was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,"" Seifert said. ""I think there will be an effort at maintaining a 'business as usual' environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.""Investors such as Steven Check, who manages Check Capital Management, said that they remain confident about succession plans due to Abel's proven track record and Berkshire's self-sustaining business model. Buffett has indicated that Abel's management style could be more involved than his own, potentially enhancing the performance of Berkshire's portfolio companies. ""I think we'll get a more hands-on manager and that could be that a good thing,"" Check said.Addressing the crowd at the shareholders meeting before announcing the retirement plans, Buffett had also cautioned about the severe global repercussions of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors present that “trade should not be a weapon,” while acknowledging that “there’s no question trade can be an act of war.”“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,” Buffett said. “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he added.Also read: Warren Buffett warns against using 'trade as a weapon', slams tariff tactics at Berkshire AGM This comes as Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway reported significantly lower profits Saturday morning, posting just over one-third of last year’s earnings—moments before thousands of shareholders poured into an Omaha arena to hear from the legendary investor himself. The decline in profits was primarily attributed to a significant decrease in Berkshire's investment valuations and insurance losses of $860 million, stemming from policies issued by Geico and other insurance subsidiaries before the severe Southern California wildfires.Berkshire's first-quarter net earnings decreased to $4.6 billion ($3,200 per Class A share) from $12.7 billion ($8,825 per Class A share) in the corresponding period of the previous year.Buffett consistently advises investors to concentrate on operating earnings, which exclude the fluctuations in investment values. Although Berkshire must report these investment changes regardless of stock sales, these variations can obscure the actual performance of its operations.The operating earnings experienced a 14% reduction, reaching $9.6 billion ($6,703.41 per Class A share), compared to $11.2 billion ($7,796.47 per share) in the previous year. This performance fell short of FactSet Research's projection of $7,076.90 per Class A share.Notwithstanding the earnings reduction, the Q&A session with Buffett continues to be the highlight of Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend. Investors are particularly interested in understanding the reasons behind the company's unprecedented cash holdings of $347.7 billion, an increase from $334.2 billion at the conclusion of 2024.Read more: Buffett's Berkshire sees profit fall amid wildfire losses, draws thousands to Omaha meeting","Buffett announced his retirement at the close of a five-hour Q&A session during the annual shareholder meeting.

"Over 15,000 USDA workers accept Trump-era payouts to leave their jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-15000-usda-workers-accept-trump-era-payouts-to-leave-their-jobs/articleshow/120884480.cms,"More than 15,000 employees at the US Department of Agriculture have accepted financial incentives to leave their posts, as part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to downsize the federal workforce. According to a USDA briefing shared with congressional staff and reviewed by Reuters, this represents roughly 15% of the department’s total employees.The departures follow two rounds of what the administration has called the Deferred Resignation Program . In February, nearly 3,900 staff signed agreements to leave. That number surged in April, with over 11,300 additional contracts finalised, bringing the total to 15,182. The USDA has said that figure may still rise as older staff were given more time to decide and some who agreed to resign have yet to sign their contracts.A spokesperson confirmed the resignations and said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins is focused on improving the department’s efficiency. Those exiting include hundreds of frontline Farm Service Agency employees and thousands from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both of which play key roles in assisting American farmers.The move comes alongside broader cuts across government departments, with intelligence agencies also targeted. The Trump administration reportedly plans to reduce CIA staff by 1,200 over several years, while thousands of roles at the NSA and other agencies could also be axed. The CIA noted some cuts will come from early retirements and slowed hiring, and defended the downsizing as a “holistic strategy” to better align with national security priorities.Diversity, equity and inclusion programmes across intelligence bodies have also been scrapped, though legal challenges are ongoing. Meanwhile, the administration has removed several top officials, including the head of the NSA and Cyber Command, further signalling the scope of the shake-up.While the job market nationwide remains relatively steady — with 177,000 new jobs added in April — concerns are growing that Trump’s tariff policies and domestic spending cuts could ultimately cool economic momentum. Economists warn that shrinking the federal workforce could hurt job growth and trigger wider repercussions, especially for sectors dependent on public funding or contracts.For now, the unemployment rate remains low at 4.2%. But the long-term effects of Musk-backed federal cutbacks under the Department of Government Efficiency may yet reveal deeper consequences for American workers and government services alike.","More than 15,000 employees at the US Department of Agriculture have accepted financial incentives to leave their posts.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of the U.S. movie industry? It's struggling It's thriving

Donald Trump has said that the United States will slap a 100% tariff on all foreign-made films, accusing other countries of undermining Hollywood and using cinema as a propaganda tool. The dramatic announcement came via a post on Truth Social, in which the US President described the state of the American movie industry in stark terms.“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump posted. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!”“Therefore, I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”The USTR notes that non-tariff trade barriers, like regulations and foreign tax incentives, may disadvantage US filmmakers. Many international cities offer generous tax breaks to attract film and TV productions, prompting a shift to locations like Toronto and Dublin. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a major tax credit to revive Hollywood production.Meanwhile, US movie ticket sales have dropped as fewer major films hit theaters post-pandemic and viewers increasingly turn to home streaming platforms.The move adds another layer to Trump’s chaotic trade policies, which have already sent shockwaves through the global economy. Since returning to office, he has placed tariffs on a vast range of imported goods, including a massive 145% levy on products from China. In retaliation, China slapped a 125% tariff on American exports, fuelling a trade war that’s disrupted global supply chains and raised fears of a recession.US economic data released last week showed a 0.3% contraction in GDP in the first quarter of 2025, with imports and consumer spending sharply down. Meanwhile, ocean container bookings from China have plummeted by 60%, leading shipping companies to cancel up to a quarter of sailings. At the Port of Los Angeles, arrivals are expected to fall by 35% as businesses halt orders amid tariff uncertainty.Economists blame Trump’s erratic trade tactics for the growing instability. “All of it,” said Boston College economist Brian Bethune when asked how much of the downturn could be traced to Trump’s policies.Despite claiming he is negotiating “privileged” deals with countries like Switzerland, South Korea and Japan, foreign leaders complain of confusion and lack of communication. “There’s not a coherent strategy,” said Josh Lipsky of the Atlantic Council. “They don’t understand completely what the White House wants, nor who they should be negotiating with.”","Donald Trump has said that the United States will slap a 100% tariff on all foreign-made films.
