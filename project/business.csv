"Delhi Flight Delays: Longer wait times, flight delays, Delhi airport ATC hit by technical snag; airlines issue advisory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-atc-software-issue-causing-flight-delays/articleshow/125148789.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flights are facing serious delays at Delhi Airport on Friday due to a software issue in the air traffic control (ATC). Sources say the ""Aeronautical Message Switching System"" (AMSS) has been facing an issue for at leats the last two days that has slowed down flight movements and now delays have got ""stacked up"". By 9 am Friday, over 150 flights had been affected.Departures have been delayed by well over hour. With planes not able to take off in time, the airport will soon not have place for parking arriving aircraft that will affect arrivals too.Delhi Airport issued a ""passenger advisory' on X Friday morning: ""Due to a technical issue with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system, flight operations at IGIA are experiencing delays. Their team is actively working with all stakeholders including DIAL to resolve it at the earliest.

We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused. ”The AMSS software processes flight plans submitted by airlines not just for arrivals and departures to and from IGIA, but also for aircraft overflying Delhi airspace.Flight plans of overflying aircraft are also required to know where a plane is coming from and where is it headed, “The system got over-loaded,” said sources.With the software either facing a glitch or the server crashing, this information is being fed manually into the system. IGIA these days handles about 1,550 flights daily and hundreds overfly in the Delhi airspace and the manual workload — which is also immune to errors — can be imagined on the overworked controllers. A team from Electronics Corporation of India Ltd, Hyderabad, has been trying to fix the system for last two days, said sources.Meanwhile, SpiceJet alerted passengers about possible delays and disruptions in flight operations from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, citing heavy congestion at Air Traffic Control (ATC).Taking to X, the airline in a statement said, ""Due to ATC (Air Traffic Control) congestion at Delhi, all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights might get affected.

SIR sets Bengal's Muslim marriage register ringing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sir-sets-bengals-muslim-marriage-register-ringing/articleshow/125147109.cms,"Photo/ANI

KOLKATA: Minority-dominated districts in Bengal bordering Bangladesh are now witnessing an unusual trend - married Muslim couples, who read their vows under Islamic law, are rushing to register their marriages under Section 16 of Special Marriage Act, 1954. According to data accessed by TOI, 1,130 Muslim couples applied to register marriages in Bengal between Nov 2024 and Oct 2025.More than half these applications (609) were made between July and Oct, when Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls was underway in neighbouring Bihar. Bengal govt officials linked the spike over the four-month period to increasing anxiety over SIR.Many of these Muslim couples wanted to acquire an additional citizenship document in view of the impending SIR rollout in Bengal, officials at the Bengal Marriage Registrar General office said.Most of these applications were received from North Dinajpur (199) and Malda (197), which share their borders with Bihar, followed by Murshidabad (185) and Cooch Behar (97). All four districts also share their borders with Bangladesh. Kolkata was at the lower end of the data sheet with only 24 such applications. Jhargram (1) and Kalimpong (2) recorded the least number of such applications.According to sources, Muslim marriages in rural Bengal are usually conducted under The Bengal Muhammadan Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1876.For this, the state gives licences to Muhammadan Marriage and Divorce Registrars (MMRs), who are mostly kazis.""Marriage and divorce certificates issued by the kazis are legally valid, but lack uniformity, with MMRs following their personal formats. The address verification process is also vague. Due to this, multiple govt and private bodies do not accept these kazi-issued certificates as valid marriage documents. The certificates that are issued under Special Marriage Act, not only weed out such problems but are the most acceptable marriage document anywhere in India. These are also considered as citizenship proof in many cases,"" an officer said.Another senior official pointed out that marriage and divorce registrations for Muslims were so far done under the 1876 Act because the process was simpler, allowing individuals to quickly marry, divorce and remarry.""While polygamy is banned, because this Act vests a lot of power in the kazis, it can be manipulated to end a marriage quickly and allow remarriage, bypassing the rigours of legal scrutiny or court cases. The Special Marriage Act, however, is more stringent and allows only one marriage at a time,"" the official explained.","1,130 Muslim couples applied to register marriages in Bengal between Nov 2024 and Oct 2025.

SC relaxes rule on advance disclosure of arrest reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-relaxes-rule-on-advance-disclosure-of-arrest-reasons/articleshow/125147098.cms,"NEW DELHI: Carving out an important exception to a constitutional mandate that an accused must be informed in advance in writing about grounds of his arrest, Supreme Court Thursday that said in crimes like hit-and-run cases, police can inform him about grounds of arrest later but at least two hours prior to his production before a magistrate.This clarification came from a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih on a plea filed by Mihir Rajesh Shah, who claimed his arrest in the BMW hit-and-run case of July 7, 2024, was illegal and unconstitutional as he was not informed about the grounds of his arrest prior to Mumbai police taking him into custody.Shah, allegedly under influence of alcohol, was accused of hitting a scooter, impact of which flung the man aside, but the pillion rider was caught under the bonnet and front wheel and dragged for quite a distance resulting in her death. Shah fled the scene without informing police. He had challenged the legality of arrest alleging that he was not informed about the reasons prior to arrest.The bench affirmed the fundamental right of every person to be informed about the grounds of his arrest and that non-communication would render the arrest illegal. It also said that it was the duty of the magistrate, before whom the accused is produced within 24 hours of arrest, to inquire whether the requirement of prior communication of grounds of arrest has been complied with.However, SC said, ""There may be situations wherein it may not be practically possible to supply such grounds of arrest to the arrested person at the time of his arrest or immediately... It may so happen that in the presence of a police officer a cognisable offence is being committed, and the factual matrix presents a tangible and imminent risk of the suspect absconding or committing further offence(s).""Writing the judgment, Justice Masih said, ""The constitutional safeguards, valuable as they are, cannot be interpreted in a manner to allow it to metamorphose into a procedural impediment that handicaps the law enforcing agencies in due lawful discharge of their duties."" A balance between constitutional mandate and effective discharge of responsibilities cast on police must be struck, the bench said. It said, ""We thus hold, that, in cases where the police are already in possession of documentary material furnishing a cogent basis for the arrest, the written grounds of arrest must be furnished to the arrestee on his arrest. """"However, in exceptional circumstances such as offences against body or property committed in flagrante delicto, where informing the grounds of arrest in writing on arrest is rendered impractical, it shall be sufficient for the police officer or other person making the arrest to orally convey the same to the person at the time of arrest,"" it said,SC said the grounds of arrest in such exceptional cases must be communicated to the accused at least two hours prior to his production before a magistrate to enable the lawyer of the accused to study the grounds of arrest and take appropriate steps in accordance with law.","Mihir Rajesh Shah claimed his arrest in the BMW hit-and-run case of July 7, 2024, was illegal and unconstitutional.

The earlier list, which was struck down by HC, had 113 OBC sub-groups with 77 from the Muslim community and 36 from others.The state govt had expeditiously come out with a new list of OBC sub-groups after it was directed by SC to undertake a fresh recruitment process to fill 25,000 posts of teaching and non-teaching staff in govt schools. The earlier recruitment of teachers was quashed by HC with its order being upheld by SC.On a petition by one Amal Chandra Das challenging the new OBC list, an HC bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Rajasekhar Mantha had on June 17 directed that executive notifications issued between May 8 and June 13 on OBC categories would not come into effect till July 31.",Supreme Court asks Calcutta high court not to proceed with the hearing of a PIL challenging West Bengal govt's new list of OBC sub-groups.

Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s 'How Dare You' Retort At IPS Officer Triggers Political Firestorm

PUNE: A major political row erupted in Maharashtra on Thursday over alleged transfer of a 40-acre 'Mahar Watan' land belonging to the state in Pune's Mundhwa area for Rs 300 crore in favour of Amadea Enterprises LLP, a company in which deputy CM Ajit Pawar's son Parth is one of two partners, prompting Mahayuti government to order a probe by a five-member committee and suspend a sub-registrar.The state allegedly waived stamp duty of Rs 21 crore payable for the sale deed registration done in May, alleged activists who claimed the land's market value was Rs 1,800 crore. CM Devendra Fadnavis said he has ordered an inquiry into the land deal. ""Prima facie the issue appears to be serious. I have asked for officials concerned from land records, IGR and other revenue offices to share all the details with me,"" he said.Govt has suspended sub-registrar Ravindra Taru from IGR's Haveli IV sub-registrar office on charges of ""gross irregularity in registering the sale deed and causing loss to the exchequer"". The IGR authorised joint district registrar (class I) and stamp duty collector Santosh Hingane to initiate criminal proceedings against Taru, Sheetal Tejwani (who held power of attorney for the land), and Amadea Enterprises LLP partner Digvijay Patil, named in the sale deed.Ajit distanced himself from the case. In a statement that further stirred the row, he said he had heard something like this 3-4 months ago and had warned against anything wrong being done. ""I had given clear directions that no one should do anything wrong. Directly, as Ajit Pawar, I have no connection with the case by far,"" he said.He also said when children grow up, they begin their own profession. He clarified the address of the company concerned was not his but that of his son, Parth. ""I have never contacted any official regarding favours to be done for my relatives. If anyone is using my name to do anything against the rules, I do not support it,"" Ajit said. He said ""the CM has the right to conduct an inquiry.""Supriya Sule of NCP (SP), however, defended her nephew, saying, ""I believe in Parth, he won't do anything wrong.""Pune district collector Jitendra Dudi told TOI, ""There has been an illegal transaction and necessary inquiry is being carried out. Action will be taken against officials who are part of it.""","The state allegedly waived stamp duty of Rs 21 crore payable for the sale deed registration done in May.

What is the Pune land deal controversy?

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday distanced himself from the Pune land deal controversy involving a company linked to his son Parth Pawar, saying he has ""no connection"" with the issue and ""won’t tolerate any wrongdoing. ""Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Pawar said, ""I am not even remotely connected to this (land deal). I only want to say that whatever reports are being run are not known to me. I have no connection with the issue. I had already clarified that I will not tolerate any wrongdoing. I will analyse the details of the case personally. I have never called any officer to benefit any of our relatives or any party worker.""He further said that, ""If anyone is doing wrong or against the set norms, I will never support them. I wish to make clear to officers that I won’t support any wrong actions by anyone citing my name to get their work done.""""When your children grow up, they do their own business,"" the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president added.The state government has formed an inquiry committee to probe the alleged irregularities in the Rs 300 crore land deal involving Amadea Enterprises, a company linked to Parth Pawar.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has appointed Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) Vikas Kharge to head the probe panel.The government also suspended a tehsildar and a sub-registrar in connection with the case after the Opposition claimed that land worth Rs 1,800 crore was sold to the firm for just Rs 300 crore.Fadnavis, earlier speaking to reporters in Nagpur, said, ""Prime facie, the issue looks serious. I've sought all information concerning the case from the relevant departments. Orders have been given to conduct a probe.""""The CM should definitely inquire into the matter and find the truth behind it. All the rules should be followed, and no one should flout the rules. Even those close to me are not allowed to surpass the rules,"" Pawar said.According to officials, 40 acres of government-owned Mahar watan land in Pune’s upscale Mundhwa area were sold to a private firm, Amadea Enterprises LLP, for Rs 300 crore, a deal now under scrutiny for alleged ""irregularities"". Officials noted that as the land is government property, it cannot legally be sold to a private entity.According to PTI, Inspector General of Registration Ravindra Binwade said the high-level committee will examine how the transaction was cleared. ""The committee will find out how government land was sold to a private firm and whether the exemption was given as per norms,"" Binwade said.""The documents submitted to claim the exemption will be checked. The committee will see what sort of documents were produced during registration. But as an immediate action, we have suspended a sub-registrar-rank official. If it is government land, the registration should not have taken place,"" he added.Sources in the revenue department said the 7/12 extract, a key property record, lists the land in the name of ‘Mumbai Sarkar’ (Government of Maharashtra). Besides Parth Pawar, Digvijay Patil, in whose name the registration was done, is also listed as a co-partner in Amadea Enterprises.According to the IGR office order, the sub-registrar (Taru) should have ensured that a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the competent authority was attached before registering the property. In this case, the registration was done without an NOC, resulting in ""serious irregularities.""The order further noted that the document was registered for just Rs 500, availing the stamp duty exemption. While some exemptions may apply, the order said a 2% levy—comprising 1% local body cess and 1% metro cess, amounting to about Rs 6 crore—""cannot be waived,"" leading to a loss to the state exchequer.Ajit Pawar has reiterated that he is ""not remotely connected"" to the land transaction, while Parth Pawar, who shares partnership in Amadea Enterprises with Digvijay Patil, has not yet commented on the allegations.","Ajit Pawar: ""I am not even remotely connected to this (land deal) I only want to say that whatever reports are being run are not known to me.

Reveal all convictions or face disqualification: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reveal-all-convictions-or-face-disqualification-sc/articleshow/125141997.cms,"If there is non-disclosure of a previous conviction by a candidate, a voter is deprived of making an informed and advised choice, SC said

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that non-disclosure of conviction in a minor offence, even if overturned by higher courts, in a nomination form would lead to disqualification of an elected candidate as the law mandating revealing criminal antecedents operates in full rigour irrespective of the nature of the crime.Poonam was unseated from the municipal councillor's post in Nagar Parishad, Bhikangaon, Madhya Pradesh, as she was convicted in a cheque bounce case and sentenced to one year imprisonment with a direction to pay compensation.She had failed to mention her conviction in the nomination form. Poonam claimed that her conviction was set aside by a higher court and hence her election could not be set aside because of a conviction that no longer existed.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the petitioner's plea to save her from disqualification as non-mention of conviction in a cheque bounce case, which is a not a serious crime or touches upon moral turpitude, would not materially affect the election.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandurkar said, ""Once it is found that there has been non-disclosure of a previous conviction by a candidate, it creates an impediment in the free exercise of electoral right by a voter.A voter is thus deprived of making an informed and advised choice. It would be a case of suppression/non-disclosure by such a candidate, which renders the election void.""The bench said non-furnishing of information pertaining to criminal antecedents has the effect of causing undue influence, which creates an impediment in the free exercise of electoral right by a voter.The court said it was clear that by failing to disclose her conviction under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the petitioner suppressed material information and thus failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of Rule 24-A (1) of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Palika Nirvachan Niyam, 1994.""Acceptance of her nomination form has therefore been rightly held to be improper. She being the returned candidate, her election was rendered void. It is thus obvious that on account of such wrongful acceptance of her nomination form, the election was materially affected,"" it said, while noting that Poonam had contested the bypoll for the councillor post, which fell vacant because of her disqualification, and lost.","Poonam was unseated from the municipal councillor's post in Nagar Parishad, Bhikangaon, Madhya Pradesh.

Committed to restituting proceeds of crime to rightful claimants: ED on Anil Ambani case

NEW DELHI: Businessman Anil Ambani has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning on Nov 14 in the alleged SBI loan fraud-related money laundering case against him and his Reliance group, in which the agency attached properties worth Rs 7,500 crore last week.This is the second time he will be questioned by ED. On Aug 5, he was questioned for more than eight hours in another money laundering case, where he was asked about his foreign assets and transactions related to his group entities.Just ahead of his questioning in Aug, ED had searched at least 35 premises in Mumbai (July 24-27), covering at least 50 entities and 22 individuals. During the exercise, the agency had seized several documents and digital records.On Monday, ED said it has attached the Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City, spread over 132 acres in the trans-Thane creek industrial area in Navi Mumbai and worth over Rs 4,462 crore, taking the total attachments against Ambani and his group to more than Rs 7,500 crore. The attachments were related to alleged involvement of Ambani and his group entity Reliance Communication Ltd in money laundering case.ED had stressed that it is “committed to restituting proceeds of crime to their rightful claimants”, an assertion that could lead to auction and sale of these attached properties after taking a clearance from courts.The agency claimed that there is more than Rs 40,000 crore outstanding against Ambani and his entities — the money he had borrowed from domestic and foreign lenders since 2010-2012. Banks have declared his group’s loan accounts as fraud. The department had said, “Investigation has revealed that loans taken by one entity from one bank were utilised for repayment of loans taken by other entities from other banks, transfer to related parties and investments in mutual funds, in contravention to terms and conditions of sanction letter of loans.”In its first order on Oct 31, ED attached properties worth over Rs 3,000 crore, which included his Reliance Centre office in Delhi’s Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg area, worth over Rs 2,100 crore, besides flats and offices in cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad. Ambani and RCom, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd and Reliance Home Finance Ltd are among other group entities accused in two CBI FIRs, the basis of ED’s probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.A spokesperson for Ambani had earlier said that “Reliance Centre-Delhi and Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City at Navi Mumbai are RCom’s assets, which are currently undergoing insolvency. Matters pertaining to the resolution of RCom are sub-judice before NCLT and SC”.","Anil Ambani has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning on Nov 14. This is the second time he will be questioned by ED. On Aug 5, he was questioned for more than eight hours in another money laundering case, where he was asked about his foreign assets and transactions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125144582,imgsize-803777,width-400,resizemode-4/lk-55.jpg"
"Narco-terror nexus: ED raids J&K ex-min’s house, 5 other locations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/narco-terror-nexus-ed-raids-jk-ex-mins-house-5-other-locations/articleshow/125143310.cms,"ED

JAMMU: Enforcement Directorate sleuths Thursday launched simultaneous raids in six locations of Jammu and Kashmir, including the house of former minister from Kathua, Jatinder Singh alias Babu Singh, as part of investigations into a narco-terror funding case.Officials said the searches were conducted at four places in Srinagar and two in Jammu under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Police had arrested Singh in April 2022 in connection with the case registered at Gandhi Nagar PS.The case dates back to March 30, 2022, when police detained a suspect, Mohammad Shareef Shah from Kashmir, in Jammu with Rs 6.9 lakh hawala money. During interrogation, Shah had allegedly disclosed that Singh had tasked him with collecting the cash from one Omer in Srinagar.On Sept 9, 2023, State Investigation Agency arrested a drug smuggler, Mohammad Sharief Chechi, a close aide of Singh, from Baramulla. In 2024, SIA arrested two more suspects — Selection Grade Constable Mohammad Saifuddin from Jammu, and former sarpanch Farooq Ahmad Jungal from Uri (Baramulla) — for allegedly being part of a cross-border narcotics syndicate involved in terror funding in Jammu. The arrest of the duo took the number of accused in the case to 17.According to an official SIA statement in 2023, investigation revealed a well-organised drug syndicate run by the accused — some of whom were operating from Dubai — aided by other suspects, including Pakistan-based operatives, who were pushing narcotics into India to generate funds to fuel terrorism in J&K. Heroin smuggled from Pakistan in 2021-22 was sold in India, generating over Rs 2 crore, which was deposited in several Srinagar-based bank accounts, the statement claimed.SIA had earlier filed a chargesheet in this case against 12 accused, including Singh, Muhammad Shareef Shah of Larnoo (Anantnag), and Muhammad Hussain Khateeb of Bhaderwah (Doda), currently based in Pakistan. SIA stated that Singh was in touch with terrorists of the proscribed Hizbul Mujahideen outfit and separatists of the unlawful Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. The proceeds of the drug sales were allegedly transferred to bank accounts of Indian citizens working in Dubai as “mules” (illegal carriers of money) to obscure the origin of these funds, the statement said.Officials said further investigation was underway.","Officials said the searches were conducted at four places in Srinagar and two in Jammu.

NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind exercise, CAG will carry out an audit of the ‘multi-modal transport logistics initiative’ to assess the preparedness of the railways to increase its cargo transportation share to 45% in the next five years (2030) from the current 27%.The federal auditor will also assess the railways’ planning for seamless multimodal transportation, which is key to bring down logistics cost, and plans to submit a report in the next year monsoon session of parliament.Additional deputy CAG (railways) Pravir Pandey said it would make recommendations on cutting logistics costs, promoting ease of doing business, ensuring seamless cargo transportation and integrating the digital ecosystem across the chain. “The focus will be on improving the system and efficiency in logistics to bring down cost,” he said.Pandey said CAG is conducting the audit with particular emphasis on ‘first mile and last mile’ connectivity with logistics hubs and origin-destination pairs in the financial year 2025-26. Initial studies have indicated good scope for improvement to make logistics movement seamless across different modes of transportation.CAG has roped in IIM-Mumbai and IIM-Ahmedabad for the report. “CAG, being the auditor of all ministries and departments of the Govt of India, is uniquely positioned to undertake a comprehensive, cross-sectoral audit covering multiple entities involved in the logistics ecosystem,” it said. “Accordingly, an integrated audit group (IAG) has been constituted to carry out coordinated work across key infrastructure verticals, such as railways, infrastructure, ports, shipping and waterways,” CAG said.The federal auditor will also carry out an audit for sustainable rail transport, which aims at achieving net-zero carbon emission by 2030, and also how efficiently IRCTC, the railways’ catering and ticketing wing, is managing plastic waste.In another development, CAG has set up two centralised cadres to build deeper professional expertise and further improve the quality of audit of central govt finances. It has accorded in-principle approval for the creation — Central Revenue Audit (CRA) Cadre and Central Expenditure Audit (CEA) Cadre — within the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. The scheme will be operationalised from January 1, 2026.","In a first-of-its-kind exercise, CAG will carry out an audit of the ‘multi-modal transport logistics initiative’ The federal auditor will also assess the railways’ planning for seamless multimodal transportation, which is key to bring down logistics cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125139711,imgsize-53610,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-40.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Year 2025 is set to be either the second or third warmest year on record as an alarming streak of exceptional temperatures continues, driven by record heat-trapping greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said on Thursday.So far, 2024 was the warmest year on record followed by 2023, the previous warmest. Both these years alongwith 2025 may, therefore, now be the three warmest years on record.Releasing its latest update on the state of global climate ahead of the annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belem, Brazil, the global met body noted that the global mean near-surface temperature from Jan to Aug 2025 was 1.42 degree Celsius (± 0.12 degree C) above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) average, which was lower compared to 1.55 degree C (± 0.13 degree C) for the year 2024. The average temperature rise was 1.45 degree C in 2023.The update, based on six international datasets, showed that the 26-month period from June 2023 to Aug 2025 saw an extended streak of monthly record-breaking temperatures (apart from Feb 2025), and 2015 to 2025 will be the warmest 11 years on record in the 176-year observational history.Flagging record-high observed concentrations of the three key GHG in the atmosphere – carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – in 2024, the WMO said that the measurements to date from individual locations suggest that the levels of such concentrations will be even higher in 2025.“This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year’s record increase in GHG levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.She, however, said the science is equally clear that it’s still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5 degree C by the end of the century — the Paris Agreement’s goal of making efforts to limit global warming within that level.Though the year 2024 breached the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree c above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time, one or more individual years exceeding 1.5 degree C does not necessarily mean that pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree C is out of reach. Exceedance of warming levels, as referred to in the Paris deal, can be measured over an extended period, typically decades or longer.Referring to the average temperature rise in 2025, the WMO also flagged that the Arctic sea ice extent after the winter freeze was the lowest on record, Antarctic sea ice extent tracked well below average throughout the year, and long-term sea level rise trend continued.“Each year above 1.5 degree C will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage. We must act now, at great speed and scale, to make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible – and bring temperatures back below 1.5 degree C before the end of the century,” said UN secretary-general António Guterres.","Year 2025 is set to be either the second or third warmest year on record. Warmest year so far was 2024 followed by 2023, the previous warmest.

Bihar polls: State creates history by clocking 64.7% voter turnout; breaks 75-year-old record,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-state-creates-history-by-clocking-64-7-voter-turnout-breaks-25-year-old-record/articleshow/125129792.cms,"Bihar has achieved a historic 64.7% voter turnout, the highest ever in the state's electoral history. The first phase of the assembly polls concluded peacefully, marked by new initiatives like live webcasting from all polling stations and international delegates praising the organisation. Efforts to assist voters, including veiled women and persons with disabilities, were highlighted.

New Delhi: Bihar created history on Thursday by clocking 64.7% voter turnout, the highest ever in any election held in the state. Since the onset of electoral politics in India in 1951-52, the highest polling percentage recorded in a Lok Sabha poll in Bihar was 64.6% in 1998, and in an assembly poll, 62.6% in the year 2000.The record-breaking turnout follows the special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral roll in Bihar, resulting in the deletion of nearly 65 lakh dead, permanently shifted, untraceable and non-citizen electors. The exercise was initially slammed by the opposition parties as an exercise meant to disenfranchise the weaker sections and minorities. The high turnout in Bihar Phase 1 is however being seen as a validation of SIR by the people of Bihar.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Thursday congratulated the electors of Bihar for the steepest voter turnout since 1951. He thanked them for expressing complete faith in the EC and turning up to vote in such large numbers, while also appreciating the entire election machinery for working with full transparency and dedication.“Bihar has shown the way to the nation, through SIR with zero appeals, the highest voter turnout since 1951, purest electoral roll, enthusiastic participation of electors and a transparent and dedicated election machinery. Democracy has won. It has been an amazing journey for ECI,” said the CEC.Sharing that the first phase of Bihar assembly poll -- covering 121 assembly seats -- had concluded peacefully and with a festive mood, EC said its new initiatives had made voting a ""most pleasant experience for the voters"".For the first time, there was live webcasting of polling in 100% of the polling stations, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi monitoring the feed from the EC control room here. The CEC engaged with the presiding officers and district election officers from the control room to ensure the smooth progress of polling.Another first in this election was the visit of 16 foreign delegates from six countries to Bihar as part of the international election visitors' programme (IEVP), to witness the poll proceedings . The delegates, EC said, hailed the Bihar elections for being one of the most well-organised, transparent, efficient and participative elections, internationally.Over 90,000 'jeevika didis' or female volunteers were deployed to assist the polling personnel in identifying the 'purdahnasheen' (veiled) women electors. The presiding officers updated the voter turnout figures at the close of poll before leaving the polling station, cutting the delay in updation of approximate voter turnout trends. Earlier these figures would land till as late as 11.30 pm on polling day. The Bihar polls witnessed use of colour photos of candidates on EVM ballot papers. In another first, electors could deposit their mobiles at the polling stations. Modified voter information slips ensured easy readability. Given that the voters per polling station was capped at 1200, voting could proceed without any long queues and extra waiting times.Persons with disabilities were facilitated with wheelchairs, deployment of volunteers to assist them and an e-rickshaw facility for them to reach the polling stations.","Bihar has achieved a historic 64.7% voter turnout, the highest ever in the state's electoral history.

NEW DELHI: Akhil Bhartiya Sant Samiti, which claims to represent 127 sects of Sanathan Dharma, moved Supreme Court on Thursday in support of anti-conversion laws framed by different states and whose validity has come under court's scanner.Seeking intervention in the ongoing litigation on a batch of petitions challenging the laws passed by Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the body filed its application through advocate Atulesh Kumar and supported the laws. It contended that the freedom to propagate religion does not confer a right to convert another person and the freedom of conscience of the prospective convert is equally protected.It said the state laws do not forbid voluntary conversion based on free and informed choice and they narrowly regulate only those acts of conversion that are vitiated by force, fraud, allurement, undue influence or sham marriage.""It is submitted that even if propagation is treated as part of religious practice, still proselytisation achieved through force, fraud, coercion, undue influence, allurement or sham marriage cannot be asserted as an essential or integral religious practice.It is further submitted that such practices militate against the basic ethos of the Constitution- dignity, equality, freedom of conscience, and public order-- and offend the founding civilisational principles of mutual respect and non-compulsion in matters of faith. Activities that impair another's freedom of conscience or threaten public order are amenable to regulation, and the State is duty bound to do the same. Accordingly, the impugned statutes do not trench upon core religious tenets but only interdict impermissible means, leaving voluntary, informed choice untouched,"" the petition said.""The impugned statutes are religion-neutral and content-neutral measures of general application that protect freedom of conscience rather than target any creed. They neither proscribe voluntary conversion nor criminalise inter-faith marriage per se; they address only conversions vitiated by defined wrongful means or marriages undertaken solely as an instrumentality for such conversion. The provisions are precisely framed to incorporate appropriate men's rea and graded penalties, and are coupled with procedural safeguards (verification/hearing by designated authorities),"" it said.","Akhil Bhartiya Sant Samiti, which claims to represent 127 sects of Sanathan Dharma, moved Supreme Court on Thursday in support of anti-conversion laws framed by different states.

India could generate 11 mn tonnes of solar waste by 2047: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-could-generate-11-mn-tonnes-of-solar-waste-by-2047-study/articleshow/125136313.cms,"India is projected to generate about 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047, largely from crystalline-silicon modules, according to two studies published on Thursday.Managing this waste would require nearly 300 recycling plants across the country and an investment of around Rs 4,200 crore, said the studies by Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).The studies also said that recovering and reusing materials from discarded solar panels could create a Rs 3,700-crore market opportunity by 2047.If this potential is realised, recovering valuable materials such as silicon, copper, aluminium and silver from solar waste could meet 38 per cent of the sector's manufacturing inputs by 2047 and avoid 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions by replacing virgin resources with recycled ones.India's solar module recycling market is currently at a very early stage, with only a few commercial recyclers operating.The CEEW studies provide India's first comprehensive blueprint for building a domestic solar recycling ecosystem that supports both clean energy and manufacturing self-reliance.Rishabh Jain, Fellow, CEEW, said, ""India's solar revolution can power a new green industrial opportunity. By embedding circularity into our clean energy systems, we can recover critical minerals, strengthen supply chains and create green jobs while turning potential waste into lasting value.Building this circular economy is most important for India's resilient and responsible growth.""The CEEW studies also said that solar recycling in a formal setup remains unviable today, with recyclers facing losses of Rs 10,000-12,000 per tonne.The biggest operational expense is buying back waste modules, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total (around Rs 600 per panel), followed by processing, collection and disposal costs.For recycling to become profitable, modules would need to be priced below Rs 330 or recyclers supported through EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) certificate trading, tax incentives and R&D investments in efficient recovery of silicon and silver, the studies said.Akanksha Tyagi, Programme Lead, CEEW, said, ""Solar recycling can be the bridge between India's clean energy and manufacturing ambitions. Beyond managing waste, it's an opportunity to innovate by designing panels for easier recovery, improving material purity and creating new value chains around critical minerals.""Introducing EPR targets, creating demand for circular products, improving data transparency and designing for recyclability could turn India's solar waste challenge into a green industry opportunity,"" she said.To enable large-scale adoption, the CEEW studies recommend EPR targets for collection and recovery under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, led by the Environment Ministry, and a Circular Solar Taskforce under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to align policy, finance and industry action.They also propose a centralised solar inventory to identify waste hotspots and urge producers to share material data and design modules for easy disassembly.","India is projected to generate about 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047, largely from crystalline-silicon modules.

India Shocked As UAE Frees Mahadev Scam Accused, Cites No Extradition Request Amid Paper Trail

ED seeks MEA help to take up Uppal's release 'at the highest diplomatic level'

NEW DELHI: The perplexing manner in which Ravi Uppal, a high-value accused in the Rs 6,000-crore Mahadev app money laundering case, left Dubai despite a pending extradition request, puts a wrinkle on otherwise smooth UAE-India ties. UAE has also not informed New Delhi of where he has travelled to.Uppal was considered a big catch for Indian enforcement agencies, probing the illegal betting syndicate. Multiple agencies, including ED and CBI, were probing alleged payments of kickbacks of more than Rs 500 crore involving former Chhattisgarh CM and Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel.Uppal was recently released from Dubai police's custody despite the extradition request pending since Dec 2023, when he was arrested on an Interpol Red Corner Notice.India has an extradition treaty with the UAE, and in the past, the latter had extradited high-profile accused, including British national Christian Michel, an arms dealer, held in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper 'scam'.India had sent the extradition request ""duly transmitted through official diplomatic channels"" after Dubai police informed New Delhi of Uppal's arrest in Dec 2023, sources said.""Despite timely submission and verifiable proof of delivery, UAE authorities later claimed that no extradition request had been received and released the accused.This assertion contradicts the documentation available with the Indian side,"" a source said.While Enforcement Directorate (ED) has sought the ministry of external affairs (MEA) help to take up the matter ""at the highest diplomatic level"" to ensure adherence to treaty commitments by the UAE, officials here are perplexed by the manner in which such a high-profile accused has been allowed to disappear from custody despite a formal request for extradition pending and the Interpol's Red Corner Notice still active.UAE authorities have also not informed India about Uppal's destination, which country he has travelled to while leaving the UAE.""MEA guidelines on extradition procedures clearly state that a formal extradition request must be submitted within 45 to 60 days from the date of provisional arrest, and even if the fugitive is released, it does not preclude re-arrest and extradition once the request is received,"" a senior official said. Sourabh Chandrakar, who like Ravi Uppal is a promoter of the syndicate, is also under detention based on a similar Red Corner Notice. A special court in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, had issued a non-bailable warrant against them, leading to the Interpol notice for their arrest, and subsequently, extradition requests.","Ravi Uppal, a high-value accused in the Rs 6,000-crore Mahadev app money laundering case, left Dubai despite a pending extradition request.

'Will Cut Off Your Tongue': Bihar Poll Campaign Turns Ugly, AIMIM Candidate Threatens Tejashwi Yadav

Tej, Anant Singh and Maithili to face battle for ballots today



PATNA: Ministers, movie and music stars, and a murder accused. The stage is set, the battle lines drawn. Bihar's political elite - CM hopeful Tejashwi Yadav of RJD, two deputy CMs, and 13 cabinet ministers - brace for a verdict from 3.75 crore voters in the first phase of assembly elections in 121 constituencies on Thursday.A total of 1,314 candidates are in the fray, their fate to be sealed in 45,341 polling stations across 18 districts.Nitish Kumar-led NDA has much at stake: of its 15 ministers in fray, 10 belong to BJP, including deputy CMs Samrat Choudhary (Tarapur) and Vijay Kumar Sinha (Lakhisarai), and five are from JD(U), including Vijay Kr Choudhary (Sarairanjan) and education minister Sunil Kumar (Bhore).For INDIA bloc's CM face Tejashwi, the contest in Raghopur, his family's stronghold, is a test of dominance. Seeking a hat-trick, he faces Satish Kumar of BJP, who once humbled RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's wife and former CM Rabri Devi in 2010 as a JD(U) nominee. Jan Suraaj's Prashant Kishor, who had vowed to challenge him, later stepped back.Tejashwi’s elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav is contesting from Mahua in Vaishali district under his new Janshakti Janata Dal banner. Tej Pratap was expelled from RJD earlier this year after controversies over his personal life.In Tarapur, BJP’s Samrat Choudhary — contesting a direct election after nearly a decade — seeks to prove his mettle against RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah, who narrowly lost the last bypolls. In Lakhisarai, deputy CM Vijay Sinha eyes a fourth straight term against Congress’s Amresh Kumar and Jan Suraaj’s Suraj Kumar.The drama peaks in Mokama, where JDU strongman Anant Singh faces RJD’s Veena Devi, wife of don-turned-politician Surajbhan Singh. Both hail from the same Bhumihar community — a duel as personal as it is political.Former MLA Anant Singh was arrested on Nov 1 for the killing of strongman-politician and Jan Suraaj supporter Dularchand Yadav, days after a clash between rival convoys in Mokama. Singh was released from Beur jail on Aug 6 and returned to the same prison following his arrest.The first phase also brings glamour to the fray with folk singer Maithili Thakur (Alinagar, BJP), Bhojpuri superstar Khesari Lal Yadav (Chhapra, RJD) and singer Ritesh Pandey (Kargahar, Jan Suraaj) adding a showbiz sparkle to the ballot.According to EC data, Digha in Patna has the largest electorate at 4.5 lakh, while Barbigha in Sheikhpura has the smallest with 2.3 lakh voters. Kurhani and Muzaffarpur top the list with 20 candidates each, while Bhore, Alauli, and Parbatta see just five contenders.State’s chief electoral officer Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said Wednesday all necessary preparations have been made for fair elections, while EVMs and voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) were distributed among the polling parties despatched to the booths.Among the 3.7 crore voters in this round, 10.7 lakh are new entrants, including 7.3 lakh in the 18–19 age group — young voices that could tip the scales in what promises to be a gripping first act of Bihar’s political showdown.","A total of 1,314 candidates are in the fray, their fate to be sealed in 45,341 polling stations across 18 districts.

ALWAR: A 22-year-old MBBS student at Bashkir State Medical University in Russia's Ufa city, who had been missing for the past 19 days, was found dead a few km from the varsity campus. The family of Ajit Chaudhary, from Kafanwada village in Alwar district, received the devastating news on Thursday afternoon.Ajit's body was found in a dam adjacent to White River, said Alwar Saras Dairy chairman Nitin Sangwan, who had accompanied the victim's family to the Union ministry of external affairs in New Delhi in a desperate bid to trace him. Junior MEA minister Kirti Vardhan Singh had intervened, prompting intensified search efforts in Russia.His fellow students identified the body, ending the agonising search that had been underway since Oct 19, when Ajit was last seen alive. His clothes were discovered on the riverbank the following day, indicating that he may have been swept away by the rising currents of the river, which had swollen after seasonal rains, Sangwan said.Ajit, the son of Roop Singh Chaudhary, was in his third year of medical studies, a dream which his kin had supported.The family, which owns 20 bighas of land, had sold 3 bighas to fund Ajit's education in Russia, hoping for a bright future for their son. With his death, their hopes are now dashed.""His fellow students informed the family. The body will be brought back to India following postmortem and necessary embassy clearance,"" Sangwan said. Officials said the autopsy was to be conducted by a medical board in Russia. After the procedure, expected to take two days, his body will be repatriated to India for last rites.","Ajit Chaudhary, 22, was a student at Bashkir State Medical University in Russia.

He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of sites globally.","China has shut Nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, CEO Jensen Huang said.

Microsoft and Amazon Web Services outages







Social media platform Reddit experienced an outage in several countries, including the US and India. The disruption affected thousands of users rendering them unable to use the platform, before the company successfully implemented a fix. At its peak, more than 20,000 reports of issues with Reddit were logged by users in the US alone, according to the outage-tracking website Downdetector. India also saw a significant spike, peaking at around 500 reports.Reddit quickly acknowledged the disruption on its status page and deployed corrective action.“The issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented. We are continuing to monitor for any further issues,” the company initially stated. About an hour later, the platform confirmed that the issue “has been resolved,” restoring service to affected users globally.The Reddit outage is the latest in a series of service disruptions across the technology sector.Recently, a massive outage in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing network caused widespread issues, hitting several major applications, including Reddit. That incident, which occurred on October 20, briefly disrupted a third of the internet after a Domain Name System (DNS) error at AWS’s Northern Virginia data center compromised the ability of apps to access their data.Additionally, Microsoft's Azure network also faced an outage last month that affected several websites, services and apps including Microsoft 365, Xbox and NatWest.Microsoft's Azure status page later confirmed problems with Azure Portal access. On its status page, Azure's network infrastructure was showing as “critical” in every region in the world, underscoring the global scale of the problem.Microsoft said it believed the outage was a result of ""an inadvertent configuration change"", and that it planned to remedy the situation by rolling the service back to a recent backup known to be functioning correctly.","Reddit experienced an outage in several countries, including the US and India.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Microsoft’s cost-cutting strategy delivers record margins as stock climbs above $500







Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period, CEO Satya Nadella announced, marking the first clear timeline for ending a hiring freeze that has seen over 15,000 employees cut in 2025 alone.The tech giant laid off 9,000 workers in July—its largest single round of cuts this year—followed by thousands more eliminated in January, May, and June as Nadella pushes employees to ""unlearn and relearn"" their jobs using AI tools before he'll approve new hires. The workforce purge represents a stunning reversal from fiscal 2022, when Microsoft expanded headcount by 22% in a pre-ChatGPT hiring spree.""I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,"" Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on the BG2 podcast that aired in early November.Nadella explained that the hiring pause isn't permanent—it's a strategic transition period allowing workers to fundamentally reshape how they perform their roles using AI. Employees need time to integrate tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot into their daily workflows before the company expands again.""It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,"" he said, comparing the shift to how email and Excel spreadsheets revolutionised workplace productivity decades ago.The CEO shared an example of a Microsoft networking executive who, facing massive data center expansion needs, built AI agents to handle maintenance tasks instead of hiring additional staff. ""That is an example of a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,"" Nadella noted.Despite the layoffs weighing heavily on Nadella personally—he addressed employee concerns in a July memo—investors have rewarded Microsoft's cost-cutting approach. The stock surged above $500 for the first time in July, and the company recently reported its widest operating margin since 2002 alongside 12% year-over-year revenue growth.Microsoft previously implemented selective hiring freezes in its U.S. consulting division in January 2025 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, though strategic areas like Azure cloud services continued recruiting throughout those periods.The company now expects all work to begin with AI integration. ""Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues,"" Nadella explained.","Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period.

"IBM Layoffs: IBM to cut thousands of jobs, here’s what the company said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ibm-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-heres-what-the-company-said/articleshow/125103243.cms,"IBM’s strategic shift towards AI and software







IBM has announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025. As reported by CNBC, this latest round of job cuts of the company will impact thousands of employees as the company continues to move towards high-margin software and artificial intelligence services. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” an IBM spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.”IBM has the global headcount of approximately 2,70,000 employees at the end of 2024, so if the company plans even to layoff 1% of its employees then it will impact around 2,700 employees.The upcoming round of layoffs comes as part of IBM’s broader organisational realignment under CEO Arvind Krishna. The software giant is now sharpening its focus on AI-driven cloud services and software as both the areas have shown strong growth. In its recent earnings report, IBM posted better-than-expected results, driven by a 10% increase in software revenue.A report by The Wall Street Journal revealed that earlier this year, IBM eliminated job roles in marketing and communications and also replaced around 200 human resources positions with AI agents.The company has since redirected hiring efforts toward sales and software development roles.This latest move by IBM mirrors the current trend in the tech industry, where companies are laying off staff in order to streamline operations and also boost productivity. Last month, e-commerce major Amazon announced its plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, whereas Facebook-parent Meta said that it would eliminated 600 roles in its AI division.Despite the layoffs, IBM still maintains its workforce in the US will remain stable year-over-year, suggesting that the job cuts may be more concentrated in international markets or non-core business units.While IBM has not yet disclosed the departments and regions affected by the upcoming job cuts, but emphasised that the restructuring is part of a long-term strategy to align its workforce with emerging growth areas. “We routinely review our workforce and at times rebalance accordingly,” the company said in a statement.","IBM has announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025.

Geoffrey Hinton warns AI risks extend beyond technology



Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

Tech giants push AI growth, not safety



Automation and AI threaten employment



Potential benefits of AI



Need for regulation and careful planning in AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, offering transformative possibilities across industries while simultaneously raising significant societal concerns. Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the “Godfather of AI” and a Nobel Prize-winning expert in machine learning, has warned about the profound economic and ethical implications of this technology. Hinton cautions that, as AI adoption accelerates, tech billionaires like Elon Musk could see substantial financial gains, while millions of workers risk losing their jobs to automation. He emphasises that the challenges lie not only in the technology itself but in how society is structured, highlighting the urgent need to address the social and economic impact of AI alongside its technological development, urging global leaders to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in its integration.In an interview with Bloomberg Wall Street , Hinton has repeatedly highlighted that AI is not inherently harmful, but its unchecked development can lead to major societal disruption. He compares the potential dangers of AI to a “Chernobyl moment,” referring to the 1986 nuclear disaster in Ukraine that released lethal radiation and caused massive casualties. For Hinton, this analogy illustrates how technological progress, if not properly regulated, can create sudden and devastating consequences for society.He warns that the risks of AI extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society. “The reason it’s bad is because of the way society’s organised,” Hinton explained. “Musk will get richer, and a lot of people will get unemployed, and Musk won’t care. I’m using Musk as a stand-in. This isn’t an AI problem; it’s a societal organisation problem.”One of Hinton’s primary concerns is that the rapid development of AI is being driven by corporate greed rather than public interest or safety. Tech giants are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to gain a competitive edge, often prioritising profits over ethical considerations.The four major AI hyperscalers: Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon are projected to increase their combined capital expenditure from $360 billion this fiscal year to $420 billion next year. OpenAI alone has announced partnerships and infrastructure deals valued at $1 trillion with companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. These figures highlight the immense financial stakes tied to AI, which Hinton believes incentivise job replacement over societal well-being.Hinton predicts that large-scale AI adoption will inevitably lead to widespread job losses. He argues that corporations cannot achieve maximum profit without replacing human labour with AI-driven systems. Recent evidence supports this concern. For example, job openings have dropped by approximately 30% since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, especially in entry-level positions.Amazon’s announcement of 14,000 layoffs, predominantly in middle management, further illustrates this trend. While CEO Andy Jassy attributed the decision to “culture,” an internal memo predicted a leaner workforce as the company implements efficiency gains through extensive AI deployment. Hinton’s warnings suggest that this pattern of AI-driven unemployment is likely to accelerate as corporations continue investing in automation technologies.Despite the risks, Hinton acknowledges that AI has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits. In healthcare, AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy, accelerate drug discovery, and improve patient outcomes. In education, AI-driven platforms can personalise learning experiences and broaden access to quality instruction.Hinton stresses that the challenge lies in balancing these benefits against the risks of social inequality and mass unemployment. “It’s a difficult decision because it can do tremendous good too,” he said. “Increasing productivity in many industries should be beneficial, but society must manage these changes to prevent vast numbers of people from being left behind.”When asked whether he would halt AI development altogether if possible, Hinton expressed uncertainty. “I don’t know… it’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he remarked. This highlights the complex ethical considerations surrounding AI: it is neither entirely harmful nor entirely beneficial. Policymakers, industry leaders, and society must navigate a delicate balance between innovation and safety.Hinton’s insights underscore the need for thoughtful regulation and societal planning to ensure that AI technologies enhance human well-being rather than exacerbate inequality and unemployment. The rise of AI presents both extraordinary opportunities and serious risks. While billionaires like Elon Musk may see unprecedented financial gains, millions of workers risk displacement.","Geoffrey Hinton warns that the risks of AI extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society.

PUNE: A major political row erupted in Maharashtra on Thursday over alleged transfer of a 40-acre ‘Mahar Watan’ land belonging to the state in Pune’s Mundhwa area for Rs 300 crore in favour of Amadea Enterprises LLP, a company in which deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s son Parth is one of two partners, prompting Mahayuti govt to order a probe by a five-member committee and suspend a sub-registrar.The state allegedly waived stamp duty of Rs 21 crore payable for the sale deed registration done in May, alleged activists who claimed the land’s market value was Rs 1,800 crore. CM Devendra Fadnavis said he has ordered an inquiry into the land deal. “Prima facie the issue appears to be serious. I have asked for officials concerned from land records, IGR and other revenue offices to share all the details with me,” he said.Govt has suspended sub-registrar Ravindra Taru from IGR’s Haveli IV sub-registrar office on charges of “gross irregularity in registering the sale deed and causing loss to the exchequer”. The IGR authorised joint district registrar (class I) and stamp duty collector Santosh Hingane to initiate criminal proceedings against Taru, Sheetal Tejwani (who held power of attorney for the land), and Amadea Enterprises LLP partner Digvijay Patil, named in the sale deed.Ajit distanced himself from the case. In a statement that further stirred the row, he said he had heard something like this 3-4 months ago and had warned against anything wrong being done. “I had given clear directions that no one should do anything wrong. Directly, as Ajit Pawar, I have no connection with the case by far,” he said.He also said when children grow up, they begin their own profession. He clarified the address of the company concerned was not his but that of his son, Parth. “I have never contacted any official regarding favours to be done for my relatives. If anyone is using my name to do anything against the rules, I do not support it,” Ajit said. He said “the CM has the right to conduct an inquiry.”Supriya Sule of NCP (SP), however, defended her nephew, saying, “I believe in Parth, he won’t do anything wrong.”Pune district collector Jitendra Dudi told TOI, “There has been an illegal transaction and necessary inquiry is being carried out.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Betting against Nvidia and Palantir: A $1 billion gamble

Reactions to Burry’s actions



The bigger picture: A potential AI market correction?







Michael Burry, the investor made famous by predicting the 2008 financial crisis, is back, this time betting against two of the most prominent companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) sector: Nvidia and Palantir. Known for spotting market bubbles before they burst, Burry believes the current AI boom could be the next bubble to pop. His controversial stance has reignited discussions about whether AI valuations have gotten out of hand. The hedge fund manager, portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 movie The Big Short, has placed nearly $1.1 billion in bearish bets on these two companies, sparking concerns that the AI market might be heading for a dramatic fall.Michael Burry’s return to social media has been anything but conventional. After a two-year break, the hedge fund manager behind Scion Asset Management resumed posting on X (formerly Twitter) on October 31, 2025, just two days before his fund’s quarterly filings revealed a massive bet against two of the hottest AI stocks: Nvidia and Palantir. His posts have ranged from ominous warnings and cryptic quotes to ""Star Wars"" memes references, all all centred around his belief that the AI market is in the midst of a dangerous bubble.Burry’s first warning came in the form of a statement he shared alongside an image of Christian Bale portraying him in The Big Short, the 2015 film that dramatized his prediction of the 2008 housing crash. The caption read:The last line is a direct reference to the 1983 movie WarGames, where a supercomputer runs countless simulations of nuclear war, only to find that all outcomes lead to mutual destruction. In the context of today’s stock market, Burry’s use of this quote suggests that the risks of investing in certain sectors, particularly AI, might be so great that it’s better to simply sit out.This post, made on October 31, 2023, marked Burry’s first return to X (formerly Twitter) after a two-year break.As part of his prophetic return, Burry also updated his profile picture with a still portrait of him and changed his bio on X to read:The reference to Cassandra, the cursed Trojan priestess who always spoke the truth but was never believed, highlights Burry’s long-standing reputation as an outsider. His predictions often seem so far-fetched and ahead of their time that they are met with skepticism, much like Cassandra’s warnings, which no one believed until it was too late.Continuing his rebellious stance, Burry also swapped his banner image on X to a still from Star Wars: A New Hope, featuring Obi-Wan Kenobi using his Jedi mind trick to deceive Imperial stormtroopers. This visual was a clear positioning of Burry as a lone figure fighting against the mainstream narrative, in this case, against the widespread optimism around AI.Burry revisited his Star Wars reference in a single follow-up post, where he shared two images. The first was a highlighted excerpt from, a book that discusses the. The passage he shared detailed how the telecoms boom and bust resulted in vast swaths of unused infrastructure, plunging prices, and the downfall of many high-valued companies that ultimately scrambled for creditor protection. This reference was an attempt by Burry to draw a parallel between the telecom collapse of the late 1990s and the current state of AI, suggesting that today's AI infrastructure could suffer the same fate.The second image in the post was a still from Star Wars: A New Hope, featuring a stormtrooper. Burry captioned the slide with the words, “Move along,”As part of his critique of the current AI boom, Burry attached three slides to a post on X on November 4, a day after his filings were revealed. accompanied by the caption: ""These aren't the charts you are looking for. You can go about your business."" The images were intended to explain why Burry is bearish on the AI frenzy, drawing on visual data to support his concerns.The first slide was a chart showing a sharp slowdown in cloud computing growth among major companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. This chart illustrated how the growth rate of cloud services, a key driver of the tech sector, has steadily slowed in the last two years.The second slide highlighted a significant spike in capital expenditures (CapEx) across the US tech sector, particularly in the AI and cloud computing fields. This surge in spending, Burry noted, mirrored the unsustainable growth seen just before the dot-com crash of the late 1990s and the 2008 financial crisis. Companies investing aggressively in infrastructure without a clear path to profitability or return raised alarm bells for Burry, who has seen this kind of behavior lead to disastrous market corrections in the past.The third and final slide depicted the interconnected, circular dealmaking between AI companies like Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, and Microsoft. Burry pointed out how these companies are increasingly intertwined in a web of interdependent partnerships and investments, a form of dealmaking that can create a self-reinforcing bubble. He warned that such arrangements could drive inflated valuations that eventually collapse when the bubble bursts.True to form, Burry backed up his warnings with action. In a regulatory filing revealed on Monday, November 3, the hedge fund manager’s firm, Scion Asset Management, disclosed two striking bearish bets placed during the previous quarter. Scion purchased put options on 1 million Nvidia shares and 5 million Palantir shares, with notional values of $187 million and $912 million, respectively. The combined value of these positions is approximately $1.1 billion.To break this down for readers unfamiliar with the term: a put option is a financial contract that allows the buyer to sell shares at a predetermined price before a certain date. If the price of the stock falls, the put option becomes more valuable. Burry is essentially betting that the stock prices of Nvidia and Palantir will decline, and if they do, his options will pay off.This is a significant move, as Scion’s total US stock portfolio shrank from 15 positions at the end of June to just 8 positions by the end of September. Of these eight, the bets on Nvidia and Palantir account for the bulk of the portfolio, making up nearly $1 billion of Scion’s holdings. Burry’s move is a clear signal that he believes these companies’ massive valuations are unsustainable.In addition to these two major positions, Scion’s portfolio also includes stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb, GeoGroup, and CVS Health. However, the bulk of the attention has been on Nvidia and Palantir due to their significant weight in his portfolio, and their role as symbols of the AI-driven market frenzy that Burry has warned against. The firm managed about $155 million as of March, per its latest regulatory filing.As expected, Burry’s bearish stance has caused a stir. Palantir CEO Alex Karp has since blasted the move, calling the decision to bet against AI ""batst crazy."" ""The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,"" Karp told CNBC.""The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats**t crazy. He’s actually putting a short on AI … It was us and Nvidia.""Meanwhile, analysts like James Kardatzke, co-founder of stock research platform Quiver Quantitative, pointed out that Burry’s track record of making large bearish bets when he perceives a market bubble is well-known. “Michael Burry has a history of making large bearish bets when he perceives there to be a bubble,” Kardatzke said. “This new disclosure suggests that he now believes there is an AI bubble which is due to pop. ”This kind of contrarian thinking is exactly what made Burry famous in the first place. In 2008, he was one of the first to realise that the housing market was heading for disaster. He bet against the entire subprime mortgage market, making billions of dollars when the housing crisis finally hit. That incredible story was immortalised in the book and movie The Big Short, with Christian Bale portraying Burry.Burry’s positions have sparked significant attention, not only because of the companies he’s betting against but also because they raise crucial questions about the future of artificial intelligence. The AI sector is undeniably booming, with valuations of $5 trillion for Nvidia, nearly $500 billion for Palantir, and a similar price tag for OpenAI. But Burry warns that these inflated valuations may be overestimating future growth, suggesting the market is pricing in an almost utopian level of success for these firms. If these companies fail to meet the sky-high expectations, their stock prices could suffer sharp declines, triggering a wider market correction.There are echoes of the dot-com bubble in Burry’s critique. Much like the late 1990s, when tech companies poured billions into building infrastructure that ultimately sat idle after the bubble burst, today’s AI giants are investing massive amounts of capital into creating vast, intricate systems—cloud networks, data centers, and AI tools, on the assumption that demand will continue to grow exponentially. But if that demand falls short or fails to materialize as projected, we could see a repeat of history: a market correction that drags down the sector and wider markets in its wake.Burry’s warnings echo his past actions. Back during the subprime mortgage crisis, he delivered a step-by-step breakdown of how the bubble inflated, how he predicted and placed bets on its collapse, and how the fallout revealed glaring vulnerabilities in the US financial system.In one of his more philosophical statements, Burry reflected: ""We must remember that entire societies can and often do follow the wrong path for a very long time, and that there is nothing wrong with breaking from the social norm to ensure good outcomes."" He added, ""Sober analysis on the part of the individual is paramount.""","Michael Burry, famous for predicting the 2008 crisis, has placed a $1 billion bet against Nvidia and Palantir, predeicting an AI bubble.

Who is Maya Handa?

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

Maya Handa: The architect behind Zohran Mamdani’s historic mayoral victory



Steering Mamdani’s campaign





When Zohran Mamdani made history by securing the mayoralty of New York City, one name was inevitably linked to his victory: Maya Handa. Appointed as Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025, Handa played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw Mamdani defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.The 34-year-old Democrat and state assembly member from Queens became the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, winning more than 50% of the vote in a contest that drew record participation. According to official figures, over two million New Yorkers cast ballots, nearly double the turnout from four years ago and the highest in more than five decades. Mamdani maintained a lead of around nine percentage points over Cuomo, who finished with just over 40%, while Sliwa trailed slightly above 7%. Voter engagement surged across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, reaching near presidential-election levels.Handa, a seasoned political strategist with deep roots in progressive organising, turned Mamdani’s underdog campaign into a citywide force that cut across class and community lines. Working largely behind the scenes, she used her sharp political instincts to refine and amplify Mamdani’s message, one centred on economic fairness, affordable living, and social justice, ensuring it reached and resonated with New Yorkers from every borough.Maya Handa’s rise as a political strategist culminated in her appointment as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager for his historic bid to become New York City’s first Muslim mayor. A seasoned political organiser with a deep commitment to progressive causes, Handa’s background has made her an invaluable asset in Mamdani’s pursuit of the mayoralty.Appointed to lead the campaign in July 2025, Handa replaced Elle Bisgaard-Church, who had served as Mamdani’s chief of staff and led his primary campaign. Her appointment marked a decisive shift in the campaign’s leadership structure. As Bisgaard-Church transitioned to serve as Mamdani’s chief adviser, Handa took over day-to-day campaign management, joining alongside Afua Atta-Mensah, who became political director, and Deandra Khan, director of labour and intergovernmental affairs.Handa’s résumé reads like a map of the modern progressive movement in the United States. She has worked on Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, Representative Mondaire Jones’ congressional run, and India Walton’s mayoral bid in Buffalo. She also managed Nida Allam’s campaign for North Carolina’s 4th congressional district and has collaborated with the influential Working Families Party, a central player in New York’s left-leaning political landscape.In addition to these national roles, Handa has worked with prominent local officials including Queens Assemblymember Claire Valdez and Brooklyn Councilmember Shahana Hanif, both noted advocates for social justice and inclusivity. Some of these roles were not formally listed on her public profile, but multiple reports, including those by The New York Times and CNN, have documented her deep involvement in community-centred politics.When Mamdani entered the mayoral race last year, few expected him to challenge, let alone defeat, political heavyweights like Cuomo and Sliwa. He had minimal name recognition, limited funding, and very little institutional party backing. Handa’s strategic arrival transformed those significant disadvantages into a disciplined, grassroots-driven strategy.Drawing on her extensive campaign experience, Handa reoriented Mamdani’s operation around ground-level outreach, emphasising neighbourhood canvassing, precise messaging, and inclusive communication. She prioritised genuine voter connection over traditional, advertising-heavy tactics, shaping a clear narrative around economic fairness, rent freezes, and affordable childcare.Her focus on authenticity rather than polish helped Mamdani build trust across the city, resonating with working-class families in Brownsville as much as with younger professionals in Manhattan.Handa also helped strengthen the campaign’s coalition. She brought in new advisers and operational leads, including Atta-Mensah, whose role focused on expanding Black voter outreach, and Mr Lerner, a seasoned Washington operative who took charge of communications after the primary. Together, they built a tightly coordinated and disciplined campaign that remained true to Mamdani’s grassroots message while expanding its reach across the city. And though Mamdani was the public face of the movement, it was Handa who quietly engineered its success.","Maya Handa, 34, was appointed as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025. She played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw him defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The 34-year-old Democrat and state assembly member from Queens won more than 50% of the vote.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125132168,imgsize-670761,width-400,resizemode-4/maya-handa.jpg"
UAE gaming authority announces interim CEO appointment after Kevin Mullally steps down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-gaming-authority-announces-interim-ceo-appointment-after-kevin-mullally-steps-down/articleshow/125131787.cms,"Kevin Mullally exits as UAE GCGRA CEO, leaving a strong regulatory framework; Jim Murren becomes interim CEO/Image: X

A seamless transition at the helm





The architect of a new regulatory framework





A personal departure, not a professional goodbye





A regulator built for the long term





Looking ahead









The quiet corridors of Abu Dhabi’s newest federal regulator are witnessing a moment of change. Kevin Mullally, the man who helped design the foundations of the UAE’s General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), has stepped down as its Chief Executive Officer for personal reasons. His departure and the appointment of Chairman Jim Murren as interim CEO come as the Authority moves from its formative stage into a period of operational maturity, a transition that reflects both continuity and confidence.The announcement was made by the GCGRA, confirming that the leadership handover takes effect immediately. Murren, who also chairs the Authority’s board, will temporarily steer the organisation while the Executive Leadership Team maintains the rhythm of daily operations.In a statement, Murren underscored Mullally’s role in shaping the Authority’s early development:“Kevin has played a significant role in the Authority’s early development, helping to establish its core governance and regulatory structure. We thank him for his contribution and wish him continued success in his future endeavours.”The regulator was quick to assure stakeholders that its programmes, licensing activities, and external engagements will proceed without interruption, emphasising the institution’s stability as it continues to refine its regulatory reach across the UAE’s evolving gaming landscape.For much of his tenure, Mullally stood at the intersection of policy, regulation, and innovation. A veteran of over four decades in gaming oversight, his career has spanned law enforcement, policy development, and consultancy to governments worldwide. Before joining the UAE regulator, he led the Missouri Gaming Commission and served as an executive at Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), roles that cemented his reputation as a principled and pragmatic regulator.In Abu Dhabi, Mullally’s mandate was ambitious. He was tasked with creating the UAE’s first unified commercial gaming regulatory framework grounded in integrity, consumer protection, and international best practice. The Authority now regulates a spectrum of activities across five licence categories: lottery, land-based gaming facilities, gaming-related vendors, internet gaming, and sports wagering.Under his guidance, the GCGRA established what he described as “an efficient, modern regulatory framework that upholds the highest standards of integrity and consumer protection while encouraging and enabling innovative gaming technology.” He often spoke of the UAE’s potential to model responsible, transparent regulation in a rapidly globalising gaming industry.In a note posted on LinkedIn, Mullally cited family reasons for stepping down, explaining that he would return to the United States to spend time with his wife, “five children, their spouses, and our eight grandchildren.”He described leading the Authority as “one of the greatest professional honours” of his career and praised his colleagues for their “dedication, expertise, and commitment to public service.” Mullally added that the organisation was now well-positioned for the next phase of its development, promising continued support through the transition.Those who have worked alongside him describe a measured leader who built systems quietly but firmly, ensuring that the GCGRA’s credibility would rest not on ambition alone but on structure and integrity.Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, the GCGRA operates as an independent executive entity under federal law with exclusive jurisdiction to oversee and license all commercial gaming activities in the UAE. Its remit spans regulation, compliance, and supervision of gaming operators and vendors, alongside enforcing standards in responsible gaming and financial crime prevention.The Authority’s team includes specialists from across the globe, experts in technology, law enforcement, policy, and financial regulation, reflecting the UAE’s stated goal of building an institution aligned with global oversight norms.As Murren steps into the interim role, his focus will be on steering the Authority through its next stage, moving from framework to full-scale implementation. “The GCGRA remains focused on the next stage of its growth,” he said, “ensuring regulatory excellence, responsible gaming, and continued confidence in the UAE’s approach.”Mullally’s exit marks more than a change in leadership. It signals a new chapter for a regulator still defining its place in a complex, globally scrutinised industry. The foundation he leaves behind, built on transparency, integrity, and operational rigour, provides the scaffolding for what comes next.With Murren’s interim leadership and an established executive team, the GCGRA now moves forward on steady ground, its early architect stepping aside but leaving behind a blueprint designed for endurance.","Kevin Mullally has stepped down as CEO of the UAE's General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority.

US Airport Shutdown: US losing $15bn each week; 40 airports to be closed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-crisis-deepens-us-losing-15bn-each-week-40-airports-to-be-closed/articleshow/125126785.cms,"Mayhem At US Airports: Americans Suffer As FAA Orders 10% Flight Cuts Amid Govt Shutdown | Watch

40 airports to face closures





Political stalemate continues









The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history. With no agreement between Republicans and Democrats, key services are now being disrupted and the economic impact is growing. Analysts estimate the shutdown is costing the economy about $15bn a week, as per Bloomberg.Air travel is the latest major sector to be affected. The Federal Aviation Administration says it will reduce flights across 40 busy airports from Friday because of severe staff shortages, and officials warn that delays and cancellations are likely to worsen if the shutdown continues.The congressional deadlock centres on funding for healthcare subsidies and broader government spending. Democrats insist that expiring health insurance tax credits must be renewed and cuts to Medicaid reversed before any agreement is signed. Republicans, who control both chambers but lack the Senate votes needed to pass a spending bill alone, are pushing for a short-term funding measure without concessions. Trump has refused to engage in negotiations until the government is reopened, and at the same time has threatened to permanently sack thousands of federal workers.Nearly 1.4 million federal employees are either on unpaid leave or working without pay. Millions of Americans are already feeling the effects: food assistance has been disrupted, national parks shuttered, government-backed loans frozen, and key economic data suspended. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that growth could fall by up to two percentage points in the final quarter of the year — and that if the shutdown extends to Thanksgiving, around $14bn will never be recovered.The most alarming consequences are now being felt in US air travel. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it will reduce flights by 10% across 40 major airports from Friday, citing severe staffing shortages. More than 400 shortages have been logged at FAA facilities since 1 October — four times higher than this time last year. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid for over a month, many forced into mandatory overtime while struggling to pay bills or even transport costs to work.“We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We’re in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”Major aviation unions and airlines warn that hundreds, if not thousands, of flights could be cancelled. Bedford admitted the agency “can’t ignore” the impact of exhausted and unpaid workers, adding that even if the government reopens, normal operations cannot resume immediately. Transport Secretary Sean Duffy has issued some of the starkest warnings so far, saying controllers might miss a second full paycheque next week — a scenario he said could bring “mass chaos”, including the closure of airspace in parts of the country.During the past weekend alone, at least 39 flight control facilities reported potential staffing limits, compared to a pre-shutdown weekend average of just over eight. Travel industry leaders say confidence in America’s air system is being damaged, and the shutdown is “forcing difficult operational decisions” that could ripple across the global aviation network.Despite the mounting crisis, progress in Congress is limited. Senate Majority Leader John Thune claims his “gut” suggests a breakthrough may be near, but Democrats and Republicans remain entrenched. Some moderates in both parties want a deal before Thanksgiving, though repeated Senate votes on a short-term funding plan have failed 14 times.The White House has adopted a more aggressive posture than in previous shutdowns. Trump has not only refused to guarantee retroactive pay for furloughed workers, but has openly sought to permanently fire “non-essential” employees. A federal judge blocked the attempt to lay off around 4,000 workers, but the administration is appealing. “Back pay depends on who we’re talking about,” Trump told reporters. “Some workers don’t deserve to be taken care of. ”Essential services such as border control, hospital care and mail delivery continue, but many others are paralysed. National monuments are shut, government-backed loans stalled, and the suspension of economic reports has fuelled uncertainty among markets and policymakers.During the last shutdown in 2018–19, widespread flight disruptions finally forced an end to the blockade. Analysts warn history could repeat itself — but with air travel already at a breaking point and billions in economic losses mounting, the cost of political stalemate is rising fast. Whether Congress can reach a compromise, and whether the White House will sign it, remains the central unanswered question as the shutdown grinds toward a second month.","The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history.

Significance today









Oman will mark National Day with its first-ever formal two-day holiday starting in 2025, commemorating the historic 1650 expulsion of Portuguese forces that restored the nation’s ports and sovereignty. More than a public holiday, it is a celebration of national identity, cultural pride, and community, giving Omanis an extended period to reflect, rejoice, and spend time with their families.Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country. The Portuguese arrived in Oman in 1507, shortly after Vasco da Gama’s voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to India. They fortified Muscat and established it as a strategic port to protect their Indian Ocean trade routes.Over time, the Portuguese presence faced resistance. The influential Al-Ya’ribi clan, frustrated by perceived exploitation, signed a treaty with the British East India Company granting the British rights in Omani ports. This weakened Portuguese control and paved the way for a successful rebellion. On 18 November 1650, Imam Sultan Bin Saif led forces that expelled the Portuguese from Oman and its ports, restoring the nation’s sovereignty.This historic victory is the foundation of Oman’s National Day celebrations.Traditionally, Oman’s National Day was observed on 18 November. To modernize and consolidate the holiday period, His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik issued Royal Decree No. 15/2025 on 21 January 2025, amending Royal Decree No. 88/2022. The decree established 20 and 21 November as the official National Day holiday, creating a continuous two-day celebration.The decree, published in the Official Gazette (Issue 1581) on 26 January 2025, came into immediate effect. Key points include:This change consolidates the observance into a single holiday period while preserving the historical significance of Oman’s independence.Omanis observe the holiday with patriotic and cultural events:The two-day holiday encourages many Omanis to visit their home villages, often resulting in heavier traffic during the period. These celebrations blend historical remembrance with community engagement, reflecting both pride and unity.Oman’s National Day serves as a reminder of the nation’s historic struggle for independence and a celebration of contemporary national identity. From the historic rebellion against the Portuguese to the modern royal decree consolidating the national holiday, the observance connects Oman’s proud past and vibrant present, highlighting its remarkable journey as a proud, sovereign nation.","Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country.

How much is Michael Burry worth today?





A contrarian once more





Michael Burry, the real-life investor immortalised by Christian Bale in(2015), built his reputation on one of the most daring financial calls in modern history. Long before the 2008 financial crisis hit, Burry identified the fragility of the US mortgage-backed securities market and positioned his hedge fund, Scion Capital, to profit from its collapse. When the crash came, he and his investors made hundreds of millions of dollars.Originally trained as a medical doctor, Burry’s passion for markets began while studying at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. His transition from medicine to money management was grounded in deep, data-driven value investing and rigorous fundamental analysis. By the time he launched Scion Capital in 2000, his contrarian instincts had already set him apart. Even during the dot-com crash, his fund posted strong returns by identifying undervalued stocks and shorting overhyped ones.Today, Burry runs Scion Asset Management, a private investment firm that continues his trademark contrarian strategy, betting against what he sees as overvalued assets and taking long positions on those the market underappreciates. His reputation for spotting bubbles before they burst has made his every move a matter of public fascination.Burry’s unpredictable presence on social media, where he often posts ominous one-liners before deleting them, only fuels this fascination. An X (formerly Twitter) account calledexists solely to preserve his deleted posts. Yet since spring 2023, the legendary investor has gone completely silent online, until a week ago.After two quiet years, Michael Burry has re-emerged with another high-conviction bet, this time targeting the booming AI sector. Through Scion Asset Management, he has placed put options worth a combined $1.1 billion against two of the industry’s most celebrated companies: Nvidia and Palantir Technologies.The latest regulatory filings show Scion purchased:These positions together dominate Scion’s portfolio, accounting for nearly 80 percent of its total US holdings. The portfolio itself has shrunk from 15 positions in June 2025 to just eight by the end of Septembe, a clear sign of Burry’s conviction.Through this move, Burry is effectively wagering that the current AI boom, driven by soaring valuations and investor euphoria, is unsustainable. In his view, the growth of cloud computing is slowing, capital expenditures are ballooning, and the market’s expectations have run far ahead of economic reality. He has even compared the AI rally to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s and the housing bubble he famously shorted in 2008.Whether this new “Big Short 2.0” proves prophetic or premature remains to be seen, but the audacity of the move has reignited debate across Wall Street about whether artificial intelligence is becoming the next great bubble.Burry’s Q3 2025 portfolio reflects extreme concentration and conviction, a hallmark of his investing style.Two-thirds of Scion Asset Management’s entire portfolio rests on the Palantir short alone, an extraordinary level of concentration that rivals Burry’s famous 2008 mortgage trade. With nearly $1 billion tied up in AI-related shorts, this position dominates the firm’s holdings and highlights Burry’s conviction that AI valuations are dangerously inflated.To put this in context, Scion Asset Management now manages a total U.S. stock portfolio of around $1.38 billion, meaning that the Palantir and Nvidia bets alone account for the bulk of the firm’s exposure. The move is either a masterstroke of foresight, if the AI market corrects sharply, or a high-stakes overreach, should valuations continue to rise.As of early 2025, Michael Burry’s personal net worth is estimated at around $300 million. This figure reflects his cumulative earnings from past trades, fund management fees, and personal investments, including the extraordinary profits he made during the 2008 housing market collapse.However, this valuation tells only part of the story. Burry’s wealth could have been considerably higher were it not for the timing of one pivotal trade made through his investment firm, Scion Asset Management, in 2020.At the time, Scion had quietly built a significant stake of about 1.7 million shares, representing roughly 5.3 percent of GameStop Corp, a struggling video game retailer that Burry believed was both undervalued and heavily shorted. His thesis was simple yet prescient: the company’s balance sheet was cleaner than the market assumed, and its aggressive share buybacks and renewed sharp focus on e-commerce could deliver a strong turnaround.Yet just as the now-infamous GameStop short squeeze was about to unfold, Burry exited his position. Scion sold its entire holding in the fourth quarter of 2020, when GameStop’s share price hovered between $10 and $20. The sale likely netted the fund around $100 million, a solid return, but modest compared with what was to follow.Only weeks later, retail traders, galvanised by online forums and zero-commission trading — sent GameStop’s shares soaring to nearly $480 per share in January 2021. Had Burry held Scion’s full position through that peak, the fund could have realised gains exceeding $1 billion.While hindsight makes the missed windfall stark, the decision was consistent with Burry’s disciplined, fundamentals-driven approach: he had invested in GameStop for its intrinsic value, not to chase a speculative frenzy. Still, the timing underscores how even the market’s most contrarian minds cannot always predict the unpredictable.Michael Burry’s decision to short Nvidia and Palantir is a defining moment of his post-crisis career. It brings him full circle, once again challenging market consensus when enthusiasm is at its peak. His record suggests that when he sees irrational exuberance, he acts decisively and often alone.Whether his latest wager against the AI boom becomes another legendary call or a rare misstep, Burry’s conviction remains unmistakable. In a market captivated by artificial intelligence and growth narratives, he stands as a reminder that even in 2025, one of finance’s most famous sceptics still sees reason to bet against the crowd.","Michael Burry, the real-life investor immortalised by Christian Bale in(2015), built his reputation on one of the most daring financial calls in modern history.
