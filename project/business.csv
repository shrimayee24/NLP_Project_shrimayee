What is the case?

The three Indian nationals who went missing in Iran recently, have been rescued, the Iranian embassy in India said on Tuesday.""Three missing Indian citizens freed by Tehran police. Local media in Iran say police have found and released three Indian men who had gone missing in Iran,"" it posted on its X handle.According to the Islamic Republic's Mehr news agency, the men, who are from Punjab, were stopped in Iran on May 1 while on their way to Australia. A local travel company had promised them lucrative jobs in Australia.Citing Tehran-based Tasnim news outlet, the report further stated that the group was ""freed"" in a police operation against the hostage-takers in south Tehran's Varamin.As per a statement by the Indian embassy on May 28, family members of the missing individuals approached the mission with concerns about their relatives’ ""sudden disappearance.""""Family members of 3 Indian citizens have informed theeEmbassy of India that their relatives are missing after having travelled to Iran,"" the statement read.The following day, the Iranian embassy in India announced the case was being followed up by the Consular Affairs Department of their Ministry of foreign affairs. It also asked Indian citizens ""not to be deceived by the promises of unauthorized individuals or illegal Indian agencies offering travel to other countries.""","The three Indian nationals who went missing in Iran recently, have been rescued, the Iranian embassy in India said on Tuesday.

‘Aviation emissions controlneeds strong action by govt’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aviation-emissions-controlneeds-strong-action-by-govt/articleshow/121604852.cms,"The success of the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme hinges on govts stepping up to the challenge, said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh on Wednesday. As airlines brace for the mandatory offsetting of a portion of international flight emissions from Jan 2027, the big question is whether govts will be able to provide enough carbon credits for airlines to purchase and offset the emissions. Offsetting will put a financial burden on airlines, including those from India. However, the current problem for the airline industry is the dearth of purchase options.""If CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) doesn't work the way it should, it won't be because of a lack of action on the part of airlines; it will be because of a lack of action on the part of govts to make credits available,"" said Walsh.""We've been talking to govts and we have realised that many of them do not understand their obligation under the ICAO-CORSIA agreement to make eligible units available to us. (ICAO stands for International Civil Aviation Organization.) We're seeing more and more countries now acknowledge that there is a need to play their part, but also acknowledge that this is an opportunity. There are some credits available, but the volume that is required is going to ramp up significantly.We've highlighted this to ICAO. Our obligation is to buy and redeem carbon credits; their obligation is to make it available. We can't fulfil our obligation on this if govts in the first place don't fulfil theirs,"" he said.While Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production will double to 2 million tons in 2025, it will only meet 0.7% of airline fuel needs, said IATA. ""CORSIA must be successful. It is a credible and verifiable system that requires carbon credits of only the highest standard, making its positive impact on climate unquestionable. But, more govts need to join Guyana, which, to date, is the only state to certify credits for airlines to purchase,"" said Walsh. ""These actions must be accompanied by ringing the alarm bells on SAF production. We need more effective leadership. For govts, that means delivering policy actions and certainty, preferably production incentives, that have a track record of success. Meanwhile, companies that can produce SAF must stop procrastinating and get to work at ramping up production capacity.""","The success of the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme hinges on govts stepping up to the challenge, says IATA director general Willie Walsh.

Why China 'turning off tap' may be another Pakistan bluff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-china-turning-off-tap-may-be-another-pakistan-bluff/articleshow/121607515.cms,"GUWAHATI/NEW DELHI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Monday demolished latest Pakistani scaremongering after India decisively stepped away from Indus Waters Treaty - what if China cuts off Brahmaputra's water supply to India? He called it a myth & cited hard data to prove the river slicing through Assam is a rain-fed watercourse that grows in India, not shrinks.""Let's dismantle this myth - not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,"" Sarma posted on X, adding: ""Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream - it is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory.""According to Sarma, China's contribution to the river's flow is minimal, only 30-35%, mostly from glacial melt and limited Tibetan rainfall. The rest 65-70% is generated inside India by torrential monsoon rainfall across Arunachal, Assam, Nagaland, and Meghalaya.Sarma further listed major Indian tributaries feeding Brahmaputra - Subansiri, Lohit, Kameng, Manas, Dhansiri, Jia-Bharali, and Kopili, along with inflows from Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia Hills via rivers like Krishnai, Digaru, and Kulsi.If China ever does ""turn off the tap"", Sarma said it might actually reduce flood devastation in Assam, which displaces lakhs annually. At Tuting on India-China border in Arunachal's Upper Siang district, Brahmaputra's flow is 2,000-3,000 cubic metre per second - but swells to 15,000-20,000 cubic metre per second in Assam during monsoon.Backed by water governance experts, Sarma's post drew strong support from Nilanjan Ghosh, vice-president of Development Studies and senior director at Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata. Ghosh said China's upstream interventions will have ""negligible or almost no effect"" on Brahmaputra's overall flow.Brahmaputra originates at Angsi Glacier in Tibet, flows 1,625km as Yarlung Tsangpo before entering India where it runs 918km - as Siang, Dihang, then Brahmaputra - and finishes its 2,880km journey with a 337km stretch in Bangladesh, before meeting Ganga.Though China has announced plans to build a massive hydropower dam on Yarlung Tsangpo, Indian experts said Brahmaputra's scale and Indian monsoon strength make fears of water cuts largely unfounded.IDSA senior fellow Uttam Sinha, citing peer-reviewed data, said even during lean periods Yarlung Tsangpo's annual outflow from China is far lower than Brahmaputra's total discharge in India.""India’s lower riparian position does not necessarily mean acute disadvantage,"" said Sinha. He, however, believes that irrespective of whether China eventually builds a super dam or not, India must be prepared by building capacity with an integrated approach to storage facilities, embankments, flood diversion, flood mitigation, inland navigation programmes, and monitoring and verifying capabilities of the flows of the rivers that come from China by using superior satellites for flood risk mapping and flood forecasting.He said, ""As the upper riparian state, China is strategically exploiting Pakistan’s position as the lower riparian to needle India so as to serve its own regional ambitions. Beijing is using the Indus Waters Treaty context to amplify Islamabad’s anxieties and indirectly pressure New Delhi, hoping to box India in on multiple fronts.""This is classic China–Pakistan coordination: Islamabad plays the aggrieved party, while Beijing plays the enabler - leveraging geography as a tool of coercive diplomacy. India should see through these tactics. China wants to shape a South Asian water narrative where India is isolated and hesitant, even when acting within its rights.""Referring to the post of Assam chief minister, Anjal Prakash, Research Director of the Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB), said the facts dismantle the myth of dependency on China’s flow, highlighting that over 65% of water originates within India, supported by robust monsoon rainfall and tributaries.""The Brahmaputra’s flow fluctuates naturally, and even if China were to restrict its contribution - an unlikely scenario - it could potentially reduce devastating floods rather than harm India’s water supply. This underscores India's resilience, self-sufficiency, and strategic independence,"" he said.","Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma demolished latest Pakistani scaremongering after India decisively stepped away from Indus Waters Treaty.

PUNE: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan said that ""on 10 May at about 1am, Pakistan aimed to bring India to its knees in 48 hours"" but ""their operation, which they thought would continue for 48 hours, folded up in about eight hours"".""Then they picked up the phone and said they wanted to talk,"" Gen Chauhan said.He said Operation Sindoor was the first time India had engaged in non-contact warfare. ""We didn't see each other. We saw it either through radar or at different ranges, except for what was happening on the LoC. It was a mixture of kinetic and non-kinetic war. When I say non-kinetic, that happened in the information domain and cyber domain. And, of course, there were kinetic operations where destruction was being caused. It was also nonlinear in nature. So there's something happening on the LoC and something happening as far back as Sargodha.""He spoke about how India networked all its air defence architecture and was using AI for predictive analysis.So better and faster information was available to our side. We also tried to kind of network our counter UAS system, which was countering drones.And in the 7-15 days, we were able to do that,"" Gen Chauhan said.The CDS, delivering a special lecture organised by Savitribai Phule Pune University's department of defence and strategic studies on the ""Future of War and Warfare"" on Tuesday, also touched upon data-centric warfare, which will be based on data analysis deciding cognitive or decision superiority. ""Similar green shoots of that were visible in Op Sindoor,"" he said.He also explained how, through Op Sindoor, India raised the bar and redrew new lines for military operations in response to terror.Referring to his previous media statements about India suffering losses, Chauhan said, ""You should be able to understand what went wrong, rectify your mistakes, and go out again despite the initial setbacks. That is a hallmark of a professional force. And that's the kind of thing we displayed. What I said in a couple of my interviews - that losses are not important, it's the outcome which is important."" Chauhan likened it to Test cricket, where, when one side wins by an innings, there are no questions about how many balls or players played.Gen Chauhan said they would share data on the result of Indian strikes based on technical parameters like electronic intelligence and signal intelligence at some point. Stating that it was Pakistan's strategy to bleed India by a thousand cuts, Chauhan said Gen Asim Munir (now field marshal) had spewed similar venom against India and Hindus a few weeks before Pahalgam. ""But these decisions can be retracted as Pakistan is faced with a different kind of prospect, that it faces military action in case we find terror happening against us. So we have kind of raised the bar. We have connected terror to water and we have drawn out new lines for military operations against terror.""When Pakistan did ask for talks and de-escalation, Gen Chauhan said India accepted, but not immediately. According to the CDS, Pakistan's decision to talk stemmed from two facts: ""They must have assumed that if they continued in this mode, they were likely to lose much more. And the second, since they struck us on multiple fronts, they still did not have the benefit of understanding what they struck and they wanted to talk. It is only after one or two days that they realised that all their attacks against us had failed.""Revealing details of the night of the first airstrikes on May 7, the CDS said, ""We did it from 11.05pm to about 1.30am, and five minutes later we rang the director general of military operations to say that we've done this, we hit only terror targets, that military establishments are out of the purview of the strikes, and we ensured that there was no collateral damage to civilians. We need to talk to each other.""The CDS said war has expanded into space, cyberspace, the electromagnetic domain, etc. ""A lot of activities took place between both of us for four days in the electromagnetic domain. Interactivity also took place in the cyber domain. We also had a lot of activity in the domain of perception management, information, or maybe you can call it cognitive warfare, in which shaping the mind of the people is more important than the landscape.

2.5 crore 'bogus' IDs solve case of vanishing tickets on IRCTC site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-5cr-bogus-ids-solve-case-of-vanishing-tickets-on-irctc-site/articleshow/121606882.cms,"NEW DELHI: If you have been baffled by how and why railway tickets in certain trains disappear within minutes of the booking window opening even 60 days before the scheduled journey, IRCTC has detected those behind creating this artificial crisis. Only in the past five months, it detected 2.9 lakh suspicious PNRs while analysing ticket purchases done within just five minutes after booking commenced for both general and Tatkal tickets.Top railway officials said between Janand May, they have deactivated 2.5 crore suspected user IDs for booking tickets and put 20 lakh user IDs under revalidation as a part of a special drive. ""A total of 134 complaints have been registered with the national cyber crime portal and over 6,800 disposal email domains have been blocked.

The fraudsters have been resorting to these tactics to book tickets and charge more from unwary passengers.Sources said the problem of all tickets getting booked quickly is confined to certain routes and trains.""So, the focus is on weeding out users who are beating the system. Passengers can't be blamed as there is a genuine shortage of confirmed tickets. So, the effort has been to increase capacity and to run more trains, particularly during peak travel seasons,"" said an official.Officials claimed that IRCTC has taken ""systemic measures"" including engagement of leading content delivering network and anti-BOT applications - security techniques used to distinguish between genuine human users and automated bots or scripts - with cutting edge technology to ensure a smooth booking process for genuine travellers.The officials added that the railways' ticketing and catering arm achieved its highest ever per minute booking of 31,814 tickets on May 22, 2025 at 10am.""Attempt versus booking ratio has increased from 43.1% to 62.2% between Oct 2024 and May 2025,"" said an official.

'What if China stops Brahmaputra water?': Himanta Biswa Sarma shuts down 'Pakistan's new scare narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-if-china-stops-brahmaputra-water-himanta-biswa-sarma-shuts-down-pakistans-new-scare-narrative/articleshow/121584347.cms,"Poll Do you believe India’s water resources are secure despite external concerns? Yes, India’s water is secure No, more precautions are needed

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday hit back at Pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative, calling it a “baseless attempt” to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.Responding to a viral claim, “What if China stops the Brahmaputra’s water to India?”, Sarma issued a fact-driven rebuttal in a strongly worded post on X.His response came as India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in a diplomatic move following the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.“After India decisively moved away from the outdated Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is now spinning another manufactured threat,” Sarma wrote on X.“Let’s dismantle this myth, not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,” he added, emphasising that the Brahmaputra is an Indian river that gains strength downstream, not one diminished by upstream influence.Sarma highlighted that China contributes only around 30 to 35 per cent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, primarily from glacial melt and limited rainfall over the Tibetan plateau. In contrast, 65 to 70 per cent of the river’s volume is generated within India, thanks to monsoon rains and tributaries in the Northeast.Using hydrological data, the chief minister noted that while the river’s flow at the Indo-China border (Tuting) ranges between 2,000 and 3,000 cubic metres per second, it swells dramatically to 15,000–20,000 m³/s in Assam during monsoon season. This, he said, proves India’s dominant role in sustaining the river.“The Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream. It is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory,” Sarma said.He further argued that in the unlikely event China did attempt to reduce the river’s flow, it could even benefit India by reducing the annual floods in Assam that displace hundreds of thousands.Sarma also pointed out that China has never officially threatened to weaponise the Brahmaputra and dismissed such speculation as fear-mongering.Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, he said that the country, which has long relied on the Indus Waters Treaty, is now “panicking” as India asserts its water sovereignty.“Brahmaputra is not controlled by a single source. It is powered by our geography, our monsoon, and our civilisational resilience,” he said.The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river that originates from the Mansarovar region near Mount Kailash in southwestern China. It flows through Tibet, enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, and continues through Assam before making its way into Bangladesh, where it eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.",Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma hit back at Pakistan’s latest water- related scare narrative.

Impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court judge Yashwant Varma in Monsoon session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/impeachment-motion-against-allahabad-high-court-judge-yashwant-varma-in-monsoon-session/articleshow/121601764.cms,"Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: The Centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament, expected to commence in mid-July.Govt sources on Tuesday confirmed motion to be introduced in the upcoming session.The move follows a Supreme Court-appointed inquiry panel’s indictment of Justice Varma over allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at his official residence in Delhi after a fire on March 14, 2025.Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju is set to hold consultations with all political parties to build consensus for the unprecedented motion, which, if passed, would mark the first-ever impeachment of a High Court judge in India.Govt sources said that there is a process of forming a panel to investigate the charges against the accused judge before an impeachment motion. However, that formality is not needed since the Supreme Court has already completed the exercise.The controversy erupted when emergency services, responding to the fire at Justice Varma’s residence, recovered a substantial amount of burnt currency notes, reportedly stacked as high as 1.5 feet in a storeroom.A three-member panel, constituted by then-Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna on March 22, 2025, and comprising Justices Sheel Nagu, G S Sandhawalia, and Anu Sivaraman, found credence in the allegations of misconduct.The panel’s report, submitted on May 4, stated that Justice Varma failed to explain the source of the cash, deeming the misconduct serious enough to warrant impeachment proceedings.Justice Varma, who was transferred from the Delhi High Court to the Allahabad High Court following the incident, has denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy. Despite the Supreme Court’s recommendation to resign, he has refused, prompting the government to initiate the impeachment process.Under the Constitution of India and the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, an impeachment motion requires the support of at least 100 Lok Sabha or 50 Rajya Sabha members to be tabled. It must then pass with a two-thirds majority in both Houses. The government, keen on ensuring bipartisan support, has tasked Minister Rijiju with engaging opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, and DMK, to back the motion.The Allahabad High Court Bar Association has welcomed the move, emphasizing the need to uphold public trust in the judiciary.The case has sparked debates on judicial accountability and the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar stressed the importance of legal due process, stating, “Judicial independence must not preclude accountability.”","The Centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament.

"G7 Summit 2025: PM Modi unlikely at G7 summit, in a first in 6 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-6-years-pm-modi-unlikely-to-be-part-of-g7-meet-hosted-by-canada/articleshow/121556213.cms,"File photo: PM Modi (Picture credit: ANI)

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.The Sikh separatists last week called upon the Carney government to not invite the Indian PM, citing India’s alleged reluctance to cooperate in the investigations into the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau blamed the Indian government for the murder without backing up his claim, as Indian has repeatedly said, with any evidence. The diplomatic row that followed saw the relationship hitting an all-time low as both sides expelled each other’s diplomats for activities hostile to the host nation.Carney has so far not explicitly spoken on the Nijjar issue but, while talking about his plans to use trade to reset ties, has said that Canada is not responsible for the strain on the relationship with India. India is hoping that Carney will act more responsibly than Trudeau in his handling of the case and has said it is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity. India wants Canada to ensure foolproof security for Indian diplomats and also crack down on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities.",PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17.

"‘For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers,’ says Emirates president as Dubai bilaterals not revised for years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-every-seat-we-sell-there-are-probably-10-takers-says-emirates-president-as-dubai-bilaterals-not-revived-for-years/articleshow/121549276.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India and with IndiGo launching long hauls to Europe from next month. The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population.

Amit Kumar Singal, a 2007-batch IRS officer serving as Additional Director General at the Directorate of Taxpayer Services, was arrested alongside his associate Harsh Kotak in connection with an alleged bribe of Rs 25 lakh.CBI officials confirmed on Monday that raids at Singal’s residences in Delhi and Punjab led to the seizure of approximately Rs 1 crore in cash, 3.5 kg of gold, and 2 kg of silver. The operation followed a complaint by Sanam Kapoor, owner of La Pino’z Pizza, who alleged that Singal demanded a total of Rs 45 lakh to settle an income tax notice issued earlier this year.According to the complaint, Singal had leveraged his previous position as Joint Commissioner in the Customs Department, Mumbai, to establish business connections with Kapoor, including a franchise agreement via Parker Impex, a firm registered in his mother's name. Additional contracts were reportedly arranged with other firms linked to Kotak and his family.

Centre OKs 85% quota for locals in jobs in Ladakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-oks-85-quota-for-locals-in-jobs-in-ladakh/articleshow/121607045.cms,"Ladakh Autonomous Council to reserve 33% of seats for women

NEW DELHI: Conceding the longstanding demands of Ladakhi people for safeguarding their economic rights as well as cultural and linguistic identity, the Centre on Tuesday introduced new reservation and domicile policy for the Union Territory, guaranteeing 85% quota to locals in jobs while also reserving one-third seats for women in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils.English, Hindi, Urdu, Bhoti and Purgi languages were notified as official languages of Ladakh, with new regulation also requiring boosting institutional mechanisms for promoting native languages like Shina (Dardic), Brokskat (Dardic), Balti and Ladakhi.Centre's move seeks to assuage the sentiments of Ladakh's native population that had been demanding constitutional safeguards to protect their language, culture and land after the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K, which included Ladakh, under Article 370 was abrogated in 2019, and Ladakh hived off into a separate Union Territory. Though short of their demand for Ladakh's inclusion in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, the 85% reservation for local Ladakhis in govt jobs and seats in professional institutions, was worked out in consultations held by a high-powered committee led by junior home minister Nityanand Rai, with civil society organisations from Ladakh.The safeguards for Ladakh finally implemented on Tuesday, are contained in a set of three separate regulations promulgated by the President of India on Monday.The UT of Ladakh Reservation (Amendment) Bill Regulation, 2025 amends provisions of the parent J&K Reservation Act, 2004, to raise the cap on total reservation in jobs and professional institutions in Ladakh to 85%, excluding the 10% quota for economically weaker sections.The Ladakh Civil Services Decentralisation and Recruitment (Amendment) Regulation, 2025, defines the conditions for domicile status: anyone who has resided in Ladakh for 15 years, or who has studied for seven years and appeared in Class 10 or 12 examination in a school located in UT, or whose parents are central govt officers who served in UT for 10 years. Children or spouses of Ladakhis fulfilling the 15-year domicile condition will also get domicile status. The procedure for grant of domicile certificate, notified in a separate set of rules, makes tehsildar the competent authority to issue domicile certificates; an officer appointed by the UT administrator will do the same for the children of central govt officers with 10-year service in Ladakh.The Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC) Regulation 2025, notified on Tuesday, states that ""not less than one-third of the total number of seats in the council shall be reserved for women and such seats may be allotted by rotation to different territorial constituencies"". The move is in line with spirit of the Nari Shakti Vandan Act, which provides for 33% quota to women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies.Ladakh has two autonomous hill development councils - one each for Leh and Kargil.Centre had assured a delegation from Ladakh in Dec 2023 that it was committed to fast-tracking the development of UT and meeting aspirations of the people in the region. Subsequently, an HPC for Ladakh was constituted under Nityanand Rai. In Aug 2024, Centre created five new districts in Ladakh - Zanskar, Drass, Sham, Nubra and Changthang.","Ladakh Autonomous Council to reserve 33% of seats for women.

EC banks on tech for faster turnout updates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-banks-on-tech-for-faster-turnout-updates/articleshow/121607018.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a reform that promises to fix the delays in updating of voter turnout figures on poll day — a rouse oft raised by the Congress to question the electoral processes and the Election Commission itself — the poll panel on Tuesday said it shall replace the manual reporting methods with a streamlined, technology-driven system that will provide timely updates to the public on approximate poll percentage trends.“This new process significantly reduces the time lag associated with the earlier manual reporting methods. The initiative aligns with the commission’s commitment to ensure timely public communication, which has often been underlined by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar on various occasions,” EC said in a statement issued on Tuesday.The faster voter turnout update system shall kick off with the upcoming Bihar assembly poll.Reiterating its commitment to keep the public informed and ensure faster updation of the approximate voter turnout trends, EC on Tuesday explained that the presiding officer of each polling station will now directly enter voter turnout on the new ECINET app — which brings over 40 different election-related apps, including the voter turnout (VTR) app, on a single platform — every couple of hours on polling day as well as immediately upon the close of poll.These updates will be automatically aggregated at the constituency level.The uploading of voter percentage at the close of poll, just before the presiding officer leaves the polling station, will eliminate the time lag between voter turnout at the close of poll and the last voter turnout figures until now released by EC at around 11.30 pm on polling day. Thus the approximate percentage of votes polled would be available on the updated voter turnout (VTR) app constituency-wise after the close of poll, subject to network connectivity.Until now, voter turnout data was collected manually by sector officers and relayed to returning officers (ROs) via phone calls, SMS, or messaging apps. This information was aggregated every two hours and uploaded to the VTR app. The polling percentage trends were often updated hours later, based on physical records arriving late in the night or even the next day. The time-lags became a source of misperceptions among parties like the Congress, leading it to question the system during the 2024 LS polls as well as Maharashtra assembly polls, despite EC’s clarifications that nothing was amiss.EC on Tuesday said the presiding officers (PROs) will continue to be required to furnish Form 17C, detailing the account of votes recorded, to the candidate’s polling agents at the close of poll, in line with Rule 49S of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961.","The faster voter turnout update system shall kick off with the upcoming Bihar assembly poll.

Waltons’ humble origins of a retail empire

Global wealth that dwarfs nations

Beyond Retail: The Waltons' influence in sports

Luxurious life of Walton family members





The Walton family, heirs to the Walmart retail fortune, have once again cemented their position as the wealthiest family in the world, with a jaw-dropping collective net worth of $432 billion. This figure exceeds the entire gross domestic product (GDP) of nations such as Greece, Hungary, and Iran. It is a staggering comparison that highlights the sheer scale of the family's fortune. From humble beginnings in Arkansas, USA, the Waltons have built a retail empire that not only dominates the global market but also holds significant influence across industries including sports, real estate and entertainment.The story of the Walton family begins in 1962, when brothers Sam and Bud Walton opened the first Walmart store. Their vision was simple: offer low prices and great value. What followed was a retail revolution. Today, Walmart operates over 10,750 stores worldwide, including more than 4,600 in the United States alone, making it one of the most powerful corporations on the planet.Sam Walton, known for his discipline and work ethic, was often in the store by 4:30 a.m.and had a reputation for treating employees with respect. This ethos played a major role in Walmart's meteoric rise. Although Sam died in 1992 and Bud in 1995, their legacy lives on through their descendants, who continue to oversee and expand the business.The $432 billion fortune of the Walton family, as reported by Bloomberg, is greater than the GDPs of entire countries. For comparison, Greece’s GDP is around $300 billion, Hungary's is approximately $200 billion, and Iran’s is just above $400 billion. These figures put the Waltons’ personal wealth into dramatic perspective.Despite their riches, the family keeps a relatively low profile, though their financial moves speak volumes. Walmart continues to generate massive profits, and the family's shareholding in the company ensures that the fortune grows steadily year after year.The family’s influence now extends far beyond the supermarket aisle. In 2022, they made headlines by purchasing the Denver Broncos NFL team for a record-breaking $4.7 billion. It remains one of the most expensive franchise deals in sports history. This acquisition was led by Greg Penner, Sam Walton’s son-in-law and current chairman of Walmart.Additionally, the Waltons have strong ties to sports mogul Stan Kroenke, who is married to Ann Walton, Bud Walton’s daughter. Kroenke’s portfolio includes Arsenal Football Club, the Los Angeles Rams, the Denver Nuggets, and the Colorado Avalanche. This gives the family indirect stakes in several top-tier sports franchises across the globe.Reflecting their immense fortune, family members own a number of ultra-luxurious assets. Notably, Nancy Walton Laurie owns Kaos, a $300 million superyacht said to be the largest yacht in the world owned by a woman. Previously owned by Qatari royalty, the vessel was extensively customised and is a floating symbol of the family’s vast wealth and exclusivity.As their empire continues to grow, the Waltons remain emblematic of the widening gap between ultra-wealthy dynasties and the rest of the world. They are a modern dynasty whose wealth has outstripped entire nations.","The Walton family, heirs to the Walmart retail fortune, have a collective net worth of $432 billion.

Previous Disney layoffs and cost-cutting measures

The Walt Disney company has initiated another significant round of layoffs, with hundreds of employees reportedly losing their jobs across various departments. As reported by BBC, the professionals in the film, television and finance departments are impacted in this fresh round of layoffs. This latest move marks a continuation of the company's broader restructuring efforts aimed at streamlining operations and achieving cost efficiencies.""As our industry transforms at a rapid pace, we continue to evaluate ways to efficiently manage our businesses while fuelling the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney,"" a Disney spokesperson told the BBC.""We have been surgical in our approach to minimise the number of impacted employees,"" added the spokesperson.This is said to be the fourth largest layoff of the company and it follows the prevision rounds implemented over the past year as Disney navigates a challenging media landscape characterised by evolving consumer habits and intense competition in the streaming sector.The focus on TV and streaming divisions suggests a strategic recalibration as Disney continues to optimize its direct-to-consumer businesses, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. The company has been emphasizing profitability in its streaming segment, which has involved a re-evaluation of content strategies, production pipelines, and overall workforce allocation.Earlier this year, Disney reduced its workforce by nearly 6%, affecting employees at ABC News and Disney Entertainment Networks. The company has been strategically trimming costs, following a broader industry trend of consolidation and efficiency measures.Despite the layoffs, Disney’s financial performance remains strong, with its streaming services and theme parks contributing to better-than-expected earnings.","Walt Disney company has initiated another significant round of layoffs.

US heat alert! Why summer 2025 could be the most dangerous in decades according to NOAA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-heat-alert-why-summer-2025-could-be-the-most-dangerous-in-decades-according-to-noaa/articleshow/121579586.cms,"US Heat Alert

US to experience coast-to-coast heatwaves, NOAA warns



The West and Southwest, including Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada

The Gulf Coast and Florida, where high humidity will exacerbate heat index values

The Northeast and New England, regions historically less prepared for extreme heat events

Which US cities will face the worst heat in 2025



1. Northeast and New England

Cities like Boston, Hartford, and New York City could experience more frequent 90°F+ days than usual. These areas lack widespread air conditioning compared to hotter climates, making heat preparedness critical.

2. The Southwest and Four Corners

This region, already accustomed to hot summers, is expected to see record-breaking high temperatures. Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque could face days topping 115°F.

3. The Pacific Northwest

Typically known for mild summers, Seattle and Portland are under threat of multiple heat domes, similar to the deadly 2021 event. Infrastructure in these areas is still adapting to extreme heat.

4. Florida and Gulf Coast

High heat combined with tropical moisture could lead to oppressive heat indices over 110°F, creating a “wet sauna” environment. The risk of heat stroke and heat exhaustion is high.

Why cities feel like ovens: The urban heat island effect

Philadelphia is expected to exceed 40 days over 90°F, up from a historical average of 34

Chicago may experience back-to-back days above 95°F

Houston and Dallas could face “dangerously hot” periods with overnight temperatures staying above 80°F

Why heat causes more deaths than storms



Seniors over age 65

Young children

People with cardiovascular or respiratory conditions

Outdoor workers, especially in agriculture and construction

Wildfire threats: Fueling the fire season

High-risk zones in June:

Coastal Southeast

Central Texas

Four Corners region

Northern and Southern California

Later in the summer, wildfire threats could expand to:

Hawaii

The Great Basin

Southern Plains

Power grid and infrastructure challenges



Adaptation and safety measures



Personal safety tips

Stay hydrated with water, not sugary or alcoholic drinks

Avoid strenuous outdoor activity between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Wear light, breathable clothing

Use fans and air conditioning, or seek cooling centers

Community-level adaptations

Expanding green spaces and tree cover

Installing reflective rooftops and pavements

Establishing early warning systems for heat alerts

Subsidizing access to air conditioning for low-income households

Climate change and the bigger picture

The last 10 summers have all ranked in the top 15 warmest on record

Sea surface temperatures in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico are near historic highs, fueling atmospheric changes

Heatwaves are lasting longer, starting earlier, and occurring more frequently





As meteorological summer officially begins on June 1, 2025, the United States is preparing for what may become one of its hottest summers in recorded history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued an alarming seasonal outlook through its Climate Prediction Center (CPC), forecasting significantly above-average temperatures across nearly the entire country, as per The Economic Times report. Unlike past years that showed regional variability, the 2025 summer projection offers little reprieve anywhere in the US or even in most of Alaska. Driven by persistent atmospheric patterns, elevated sea surface temperatures, and the residual effects of climate change, this summer is shaping up to test the nation’s resilience to heat, wildfires, and health crises like never before.From densely packed urban neighborhoods to arid rural lands, the effects of this prolonged heat event are expected to ripple across infrastructure, agriculture, public health, and emergency services. Here's an in-depth look at what to expect, where the worst heat will strike, and how cities and individuals can prepare.According to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, model simulations show overwhelming support for a hotter-than-average summer across the continental US and much of Alaska. Areas most at risk of experiencing prolonged heat waves include:Johnna Infanti, a meteorologist with NOAA’s CPC, stated that “model guidance was overwhelmingly above normal across the US,” suggesting this forecast is one of the most confident summer projections ever released.Urban areas are uniquely vulnerable due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect—caused by concrete, asphalt, and limited green space retaining heat. According to NOAA:Lack of tree canopy, dark rooftops, and minimal airflow intensify the heat, disproportionately affecting low-income and elderly populations.Heat remains the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and floods. Vulnerable populations include:Heat stroke, dehydration, and heat exhaustion are all life-threatening conditions that can escalate quickly. Emergency departments are urged to prepare for spikes in admissions during heat waves.NOAA also projects below-normal precipitation for the Northern Rockies, Northwest, and central parts of the Great Plains. As vegetation dries out under extreme heat, wildfire risk surges.Wildfire smoke also presents a public health threat, worsening air quality for millions.Extreme heat drives up energy demand as households rely on air conditioning. States like Texas, California, and Arizona are particularly vulnerable to blackouts or rolling brownouts due to increased electricity usage.Water utilities, transportation infrastructure (such as buckling roads and warped train tracks), and emergency services may also struggle under the stress of high temperatures.Cities like Phoenix and Los Angeles have already implemented “heat officers”—government positions dedicated to heat mitigation planning. More cities are likely to follow.While seasonal weather variations play a role, the long-term warming trend driven by climate change continues to amplify the severity of summer heat. According to NOAA’s 2025 State of the Climate Report:Scientists agree that extreme summer heat is no longer an anomaly—but a new normal.","US to experience coast-to-coast heatwaves, NOAA warns.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

BATHINDA: Dr Swaiman Singh, who played a vital role during the struggle against farm laws at the borders of Delhi in 2020-21, tried to be heckled by some Pro-Khalistan persons at a Gurdwara in New York on Sunday afternoon. The pro khalistan elements were angry why he displayed Indian Tricolor during the farmer protest as they were angry with the happenings of June 1984 when Indian Army had stormed the Golden Temple to flush out extremists.Despite opposition by certain office bearers of some Gurdwara committees, Dr Swaiman stood his ground and delivered a speech for which he was invited by the committee of New York Sikh Cultural Society.A big congregation was held at NY Sikh Cultural Society Gurdwara on Sunday afternoon (wee hours of Monday in India). Dr Swaiman along with former Governor Andrew Cuomo, was invited by the gurdwara committee to deliver a lecture. During the event, a pro-Khalistani group attempted to prevent Dr Swaiman from speaking, citing his display of the Indian flag during the recent farmers' protests as their reason for objection.Undeterred, Dr Swaiman delivered his response, challenging the group to open dialogue. He boldly invited them to bring the media from across United States to pose any questions, urging them to present concrete proof to support their claims.Dr Swaiman speaking to TOI over phoner from USA said that it is true that Sikhs living in various parts of world are angry over the way the revered religious place was attacked by Indian state in 1984 and justice has not been delivered till now. But being an Indian, he displayed Tricolor a number of timers and I am proud of it. Whatever happened in 1984 was an attack by a government of a particular political party, it does not denote the entire India.We may be angry with the government or party but not with India. I too was branded as Khalistani which is not right and the country should look into the grievances of Sikhs and deliver justice but opposing me by some people could not undermine India or my commitment towards people especially in India where my team is regularly working”.The NY Sikh Cultural Society Gurdwara remains a vital community hub, fostering dialogue and cultural unity.

Gurgaon: MCG is evaluating the feasibility of constructing a new road to create an additional access route to the newly developed sectors. The road would stretch from CRPF Chowk to Kamdhenu Gaushala in Sector 10, eventually linking to Dwarka Expressway. ""It can reduce the time taken to reach Dwarka Expressway by 15 minutes,"" Gurgaon MLA Mukesh Sharma said on Tuesday.Once constructed, this route would not only serve as an alternative connection to the new sectors around Dwarka Expressway but would also enhance accessibility for bus services and private vehicles, Sharma said. The MLA told the officials that the unpaved route was earlier known as Old Najafgarh Road and was used by the locals. ""The reconstruction of the Old Najafgarh Road is not just a road construction project, but a symbol of the potential transformation that planned urban development can bring,"" Sharma said.Sharma and MCG commissioner Pradeep Dahiya, accompanied by other corporation officials, conducted a site inspection. The commissioner directed the officials to liaise with relevant departments, including the revenue department, to develop a land acquisition proposal.The commissioner directed the officials to determine the length of the proposed stretch to make the proposal.The Gurgaon MLA said, ""This road would help reduce pressure on other routes.

Renowned educator Khan Sir celebrated a joyful new chapter with a grand wedding reception in Patna on June 2. The event quickly captured public attention as it marked the first public appearance of his bride, AS Khan. Images from the celebration went viral, sparking widespread admiration for the couple’s poised presence and timeless style. AS Khan, dressed in a traditional red bridal lehenga with intricate embroidery, drew particular praise for her graceful look. Khan Sir complemented her in a sophisticated brown suit. The lavish celebration reflected not only their union but also their deep-rooted cultural elegance and simplicity.In the wake of a low-profile wedding in May, the reception provided an opportunity for the couple to rejoice with well-wishers in an open environment. Khan Sir had previously disclosed in an online class that the wedding was purposely kept low-key because of the sensitive geopolitical realignments. The reception, however, was far from being low-profile. It was graced by some of the most leading lights from political and academic backgrounds such as Bihar Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary, and Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav. The event mirrored the broad respect and admiration Khan Sir enjoys across communities.All attention was focused on AS Khan when she made her public appearance in a classic bridal red lehenga. From Siwan, Bihar, and a government officer by profession, she stunned guests with deeply traditional and regal appeal. Her ensemble had heavy gold zardozi embroidery punctuated with sequin details and delicate jaal work, exemplifying the opulence of Indian bridal ornamentation.She paired a half-sleeved, heavily embroidered blouse of round neckline and fitted, cropped silhouette with her dupatta-clad lehenga skirt in an A-line cut, with layered design, full ghera, and sweeping floor-length hem. She draped a dupatta elegantly across her body, like a saree pallu, and a separate veil covered her head, beautifully covering most of her face. Both the fabrics had ornate embroidery in great detail and edged with glimmering gold patti work.AS Khan's wedding outfit was aptly complemented by a choice of classic jewelry that heightened the royal beauty of her appearance.

A Russian subsidiary of Microsoft is planning to file for bankruptcy, a report claims. This comes after President Vladimir Putin recently said that foreign service providers like Microsoft and Zoom should be ""throttled"" to improve domestic software solutions. The planned bankruptcy declaration for one of Microsoft's Russian units was reportedly published via a note on Fedresurs, Russia's official online registry for legally significant corporate information. However, the tech giant has yet to share a comment regarding the potential bankruptcy of its Russian subsidiary or President Putin's remarks. Microsoft maintained critical services in Russia following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but in June 2022 announced a major reduction of its operations there due to shifts in the economic outlook and their effects on its business.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company had already pulled RT’s mobile apps from the Windows App Store and prohibited ads on Russian state–sponsored media shortly after the invasion. A recent notice posted on Fedresurs indicated that Microsoft Rus LLC plans to file for bankruptcy, the report claimed.According to the Russian news agency TASS, Microsoft also operates three additional Russian entities in the country, which are: Microsoft Development Centre Rus, Microsoft Mobile Rus, and Microsoft Payments Rus. However, the report doesn’t mention the status of these subsidiaries.In 2022, Alphabet-owned Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after Russian authorities seized its bank account, rendering operations, such as paying local employees, suppliers, and vendors, impossible.","A Russian subsidiary of Microsoft is planning to file for bankruptcy, a report claims.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates has announced to donate most of his estimated $200 billion fortune on improving health and education services in Africa over the next two decades. Speaking at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Gates said: “I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. The majority of that funding will be spent on helping you address challenges here in Africa.”Graça Machel, former First Lady of Mozambique, welcomed Gates’ pledge during what she called a “moment of crisis.”“We are counting on Mr Gates' steadfast commitment to continue walking this path of transformation alongside us,” she said.The 69-year-old billionaire emphasized the importance of investing in people to unlock progress. “By unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity,” he added.Gates, whose foundation has long worked across Africa, said the key to better outcomes lies in supporting women and children, especially around pregnancy and early childhood.“What we've learned is that helping the mother be healthy and have great nutrition before she gets pregnant, while she is pregnant, delivers the strongest results,” he explained.“Ensuring the child receives good nutrition in their first four years as well makes all the difference.”The Gates Foundation will focus on three main goals: preventing deaths of mothers and babies, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and helping millions escape poverty.Gates also called on Africa’s youth to use technology to improve lives, noting how mobile phones had transformed banking on the continent. He urged the next generation to think about how AI could do the same for healthcare.“Africa largely skipped traditional banking and now you have a chance, as you build your next generation healthcare systems, to think about how AI is built into that.”He cited Rwanda’s use of AI-powered ultrasound to detect high-risk pregnancies as an example of technology-driven progress.Speaking at the event, the Microsoft founder revealed that the Gates Foundation plans to “sunset” operations in 20 years, aiming to complete its mission by 2045.Last month, Gates said he would speed up his giving. “People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that ‘he died rich’ will not be one of them,” he wrote in a blog post.Despite giving away 99% of his wealth, Gates is likely to remain a billionaire, according to Bloomberg.","Gates Foundation will focus on three main goals: preventing deaths of mothers and babies, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and helping millions escape poverty.

"New norms, fresh strategy give Bandhan Life a level playing field",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-norms-fresh-strategy-give-bandhan-life-a-level-playing-field/articleshow/121612313.cms,"MUMBAI: Bandhan Life Insurance is using the opportunity presented by the new regulatory caps on management expenses and minimum surrender value rules to reposition itself alongside peers as it begins afresh under a new strategy.“The regulations coinciding with the company rolling out with its new strategy provides it the advantage of making processes more efficient,” said Satishwar B, managing director and CEO. He added that the new regulations have put all companies at par, requiring everyone to review their products even as Bandhan Life brings out a slew of new offerings. However, he acknowledged that the company “will need to have economies of scale to meet the cap on expenses. ”Following its acquisition by Bandhan Financial Holdings, the insurer has repositioned itself as a full-spectrum player offering participating, non-participating, unit-linked and pension products. The focus is now on expanding into tier-2 and tier-3 cities, using Bandhan Bank’s rural reach.Bandhan Life, formerly Aegon Life, has adopted a fully digital underwriting model. Its system pulls data directly from utilities and service providers, eliminating paperwork and easing access for self-employed customers—historically a segment underserved by the life insurance industry.“Many self-employed individuals find it difficult to buy term insurance because they are not able to meet the financial criteria because they do not have the documentation,” said Satishwar. “Today, 50% of our customers are buyers of term insurance and a large part of them are self-employed.” The company uses around 20 data points to assess an applicant’s financial position without requiring conventional documents.Moving away from its earlier digital-only approach, the insurer is now positioning itself as a multi-channel company. While Bandhan Bank remains a key partner, Bandhan Life is in talks with other banks to expand its distribution network. “We are definitely interested in health insurance if the composite licences,” Satishwar added, indicating plans to diversify once regulations permit.The company plans to grow at 100% annually over the next three years, targeting a fourfold increase in assets under management from Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore in five years. On costs, Satishwar noted that life insurance expenses seem high mainly because they are front-loaded. “If the pricing of traditionally sold policies are compared with those sold digitally, the premium is not very different,” he said.Bandhan Life will also restate its balance sheet this year. The full acquisition by Bandhan means accumulated losses can no longer be carried forward for tax purposes, potentially changing its capital structure.Meanwhile, the proposed Bima Sugam platform—a unified digital infrastructure for insurance services—is expected to enhance operational efficiency. According to Balakrishnan, the platform’s one-to-many architecture could make it easier to integrate with a single payment gateways.","Bandhan Life Insurance is using the new regulatory caps on management expenses and minimum surrender value rules to reposition itself.
