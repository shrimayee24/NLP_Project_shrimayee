"As poll campaign ends, SC readies to examine validity of freebies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-poll-campaign-ends-sc-readies-to-examine-validity-of-freebies/articleshow/110578073.cms,"NEW DELHI: As campaigning ends for the last phase of general elections marked by announcements of freebies and cash doles, the Supreme Court readies to hear a bunch of two-year-old PILs that demand political parties to compute the fiscal burden and fund mobilization for these freebies.From free education and meals for students in the 1950s, to free ration in the 1960s, free colour TVs, laptops and mixer-grinder by the turn of the century, it quickly escalated to free electricity, water and bus ride in the present day, political parties have scaled new heights with every general and assembly elections to pitch freebies as vote-catching tactics.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had heard detailed arguments on a bunch of PILs, led by one filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhya, consecutively on November 22-23 last year. But, thereafter, the cases remained part-heard. Senior advocate Vijay Hansaria on a couple of occasions requested the CJI, prior to voting, for completion of the hearing. However, the matter remained off the bench’s roster.SC registry sources said the matter is likely to be listed for hearing shortly after the court resumes normal work on July 8 after a month and half long summer vacation. The PILs were referred to a three-judge bench on Aug 26, 2022, by a bench headed by then CJI N V Ramana, as it realized that adjudicating the reliefs sought in these petitions would require reconsideration of a two-judge bench verdict in S Subramaniam Balaji judgment of 2013.In Balaji judgment, the SC while examining the petitioner’s plea that competitive announcement of freebies by DMK and AIADMK, amounted to bribing the voters to influence their voting and hence a corrupt practice under the Representation of People Act.The SC had disagreed and said, “It is well settled that the concept of livelihood is no longer confined to bare physical survival in terms of food, clothing and shelter but also now necessarily includes basic medicines, preliminary education, transport, etc. Hence, the State distrusting largesse in the form of distribution of colour TVs, laptops, etc. to eligible and deserving persons is directly related to the directive principles of the State policy.”In contrast, the SC while dealing with Upadhyay-led PILs on Aug 26, 2022, said, “Freebies may create a situation wherein the State Government cannot provide basic amenities due to lack of funds and the State is pushed towards imminent bankruptcy. In the same breath, we should remember that such freebies are extended utilizing taxpayers’ money only for increasing the popularity of the party and electoral prospects.”On the same breath, it had said, “all promises cannot be equated with freebies as they relate to welfare schemes or measures for the public good. Not only are these a part of the Directive Principles of state policy but are also a responsibility of the welfare state.”The EC, after initial reluctance to take a stand recently filed an affidavit in the SC proposing that parties can be asked to provide data on estimated number of beneficiaries, likely expenditure and total financial burden and the means to generate the amount required to fulfil the promises. But the political parties have suggested to the court not to venture into the arena of electoral politics and said the parties are responsible enough to understand the fiscal burden while announcing freebies.If the EC proposal finds workable in the eyes of the SC, then political parties would have to employ economists to answer queries about the impact of financing implementation of freebies on the fiscal sustainability of state/country, its effect on debt servicing, and whether the party, on coming to power, would resort to additional borrowings.",The Supreme Court readies to hear a bunch of two-year-old PILs that demand political parties to compute the fiscal burden and fund mobilization for these freebies. The matter is likely to be listed for hearing shortly after the court resumes normal work on July 8 after a month and half long summer vacation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110578087,imgsize-48196,width-400,resizemode-4/110578087.jpg"
Will Mirzapur roll out ‘kaleen’ thrice in a row for Anupriya?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-mirzapur-roll-out-kaleen-thrice-in-a-row-for-anupriya/articleshow/110577912.cms,"Water, a deciding factor

Caste matrix in poll play

The underdog

Urban voters

MIRZAPUR: Mirzapur , made famous by the OTT series, has never given an incumbent MP a third term. Anupriya Patel , 43, the sitting MP since 2014 and the candidate from Apna Dal (Sonelal), an NDA constituent, is aiming to break the jinx this time. Anupriya’s main contender is BJP turncoat and sitting MP from neighbouring Bhadohi seat, Ramesh Chand Bind, 50, who has entered the fray from SP after being denied the ticket in his constituency.Mirzapur comprises five assembly segments — Chhanbey, Mirzapur, Majhawan, Chunar and Marihaan. While gun-toting mafia dons like ‘ Kaleen Bhaiya ’ are limited to reel life, the real-life kaleen (carpet) traders are keen on an MP who can address their business concerns. Rajesh Kumar, vice-president of All India Carpet Manufacturers’ Association, says: “The one district, one product scheme has certainly created a brand value for Bhadohi-Mirzapur carpets, but the industry is not getting the support it needs. Incentives have been rolled back and additional compliances and regulations introduced in recent years have impacted the business.”SP candidate Bind has an uphill task to consolidate voters beyond Muslims, Yadavs and Binds. The three communities account for about five lakh votes. Although Bind has deep roots in politics — he was BSP MLA from Majhawan, dominated by Binds, Dalits and Brahmins, for three consecutive terms (2002, 2007 and 2012) — he has also been mired in controversies for making inappropriate remarks against upper castes.For Mirzapur, the driest region in Uttar Pradesh, the shortage of water — both potable and non-potable — is one of the main election issues. Farmers in Mirzapur — which sits by the Ganga — rely heavily on monsoon-fed dams and reservoirs for agriculture. Presence of red sandstone and rocky terrain make drilling of borewells difficult in this region.The sluice gates of the reservoir, which is the primary source of irrigation in more than three dozen villages of Marihaan sub-division of Mirzapur, were last raised during 2022 Rabi season. The starting point of the canal near the gates has now dried up and algae has covered its bed.Baba Yadav, a local resident and a worker of Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction, says: “For the past two years, we have been struggling in every cropping season as no water comes through the canal. In remote areas of Mirzapur, every family depends on agriculture for livelihood. Ahead of the paddy cultivation in Jan and Feb, power supply was also irregular because of which borewells could not be operated.” Yadav adds that he has been unable to convey these concerns to the party brass due to lack of access.Scheduled Caste voters, who account for 26% of the 19 lakh electors, can be the deciding factor for any party in Mirzapur. Half of them are Jatavs, old loyalists of BSP, which has fielded Manish Kumar Tripathi in the seat. Mirzapur also has a higher population of Kol voters compared to Pasis.OBCs, particularly Patels, constitute the largest chunk in the district and are expected to stand by Anupriya firmly for the third time. Rajesh Patel, a businessman in Rajgarh development block of Chunar, says, “I will support Anupriya because she is our community leader and a minister. Her margin may drop but she will sail through.” Patel, however, adds: “No steps were taken when we needed water and electricity for our crops in Jan and Feb. Water crisis is perennial and we hope Anupriya will find a permanent solution in her third term.”Backing SP’s Bind, Mithlesh Prajapati from Danti village of Majhawan says, “Bulldozers were used to bring down houses of 40 rural families in Danti in Jan last year. Nobody paid heed to our pleas, and it is time to teach a lesson to the local MLA and MP.” Local administration had identified the land in Danti for setting up a university and razed the houses to clear the land. However, the project was later shifted to Deori Kalan.Unlike Kaushambi, Fatehpur and some parts of Bundelkhand where Patels split up between Apna Dal (S) and its rival faction Apna Dal (Kamerawadi), the community stands united behind Anupriya in Mirzapur. However, Apna Dal (K) is also putting up a fight and has fielded 71-year-old Daulat Ram Patel — a retired maths professor, a former pradhan and a socialist associated with both SP and Congress — from Mirzapur.He has been instrumental in providing employment to youths in Chunar through his company which converts biomass into biofuels. Along with BSP’s Brahmin candidate Manish Tripathi, Daulat might shrink Anupriya’s vote bank.Urban voters in Mirzapur say work on the upcoming Vindhyavasini shrine corridor, proposed investment projects and improved connectivity through national highways might go in favour of the BJPApna Dal (S) alliance. Shyam Kumar Dubey, who runs a battery shop near Mirzapur railway station, says, “You should have seen the railway station earlier to realise what has changed. The only issue which I can recollect was frequent closure of the Lal Bahadur Shastri bridge (pucca pul) over the Ganga during the past three years for repair works.”","Mirzapur, the driest region in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the main election issues.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Wednesday reported an unprecedented temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in Delhi's Mungeshpur area, claiming it to be the highest ever recorded in India. This extreme heatwave has sparked widespread concern and debates on its accuracy and implications, prompting a closer examination of the data and its effects on daily life in the city.While the IMD's automated weather station recorded the temperature, meteorologist Soma Sen Roy indicated that the accuracy of this reading is under review. This extreme temperature surpassed the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. As the national capital grapples with this intense heat, officials have issued red alerts, emphasizing the severe health risks and urging precautions.""The maximum temperature over Delhi NCR varied from 45.2° to 49.1°C in different parts of city, Mungeshpur reported 52.9°C as an outlier compared to other stations. It could be due to error in the sensor or the local factor. IMD is examining the data and sensors,"" the IMD said in a statement.In a post on X, Union Minister of Earth Sciences Kiren Rijiju flagged the error, saying that the temperature of 52.3 degree Celsius in Delhi is ""very unlikely.""""It is not official yet. Temperature of 52.3°C in Delhi is very unlikely. Our senior officials in IMD have been asked to verify the news report. The official position will be stated soon,"" Kiren Rijiju said in the post.Yes, according to the IMD, Delhi's Mungeshpur area recorded a temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius on May 29, 2024.However, IMD meteorologist Soma Sen Roy mentioned that they are ""checking out"" the accuracy of the recording.The recorded 52.9 degrees Celsius surpasses the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. It also broke the 50C threshold for the first time in Delhi's history.The IMD has issued a red alert for Delhi, warning of ""severe heat-wave conditions"" and highlighting the ""very high likelihood of developing heat illness and heat stroke in all ages"". They are also reviewing the accuracy of the recorded temperature.Residents are adopting various measures such as staying indoors, using traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice), taking multiple baths, and keeping hydrated. Amit Kumar from Najafgarh mentioned, ""We're taking traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice) and using wet towels to stay cool and prevent fainting.""High temperatures increase the risk of heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke and dehydration. Dr. Atul Mathur warned, ""If you have not been drinking water, you will be dehydrated. For those who have pre-existing heart issues, their BP becomes high.""The intense heat has strained daily activities and essential services. The electricity grid faced a record peak demand of 8,302 megawatts. Water shortages are a significant issue, with authorities ordering measures to prevent wastage. People are also facing severe challenges in commuting and outdoor work, as highlighted by residents like Jay Pandit, who said, ""The hot wind feels like burning the skin, and it's affecting my health.""Years of scientific research suggest that climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent, and more intense. This trend poses a growing threat to public health, infrastructure, and daily life in urban areas like Delhi.The Delhi government has issued red alerts and health advisories, urging people to stay hydrated and avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours. They have also deployed teams to prevent water wastage and manage the city's strained resources.The IMD has warned of continuing severe heatwave conditions across several northern states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The trend indicates that extreme weather events will likely become more frequent due to climate change.","The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Wednesday reported an unprecedented temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in Delhi's Mungeshpur area.

Verdict 2024: Has BJP Already Cruised To A Majority? Exit Poll Predictions I Lok Sabha Election

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday appealed to Punjab voters , two days ahead of their vote, to 'protect democracy and Constitution from repeated assaults' by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Calling the people of Punjab warriors, the Congress leader said that BJP has been targetting 'Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat' over the withdrawal of the three farm laws.Congress shared Singh's appeal to Punjab voters on X. ""My dear fellow citizens, India is standing at a crucial juncture. In the impending last phase of voting, we have one final chance to ensure that Democracy and our Constitution are protected from the repeated assaults of a despotic regime, trying to unleash dictatorship in India. Punjab and Punjabis are warriors. We are known for our spirit of sacrifice. Our indomitable courage and innate belief in the Democratic ethos of inclusiveness, harmony, amity, and brotherhood can protect our great nation,"" wrote Singh.""In the past ten years, the BJP government has left no stone unturned in castigating Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat. 750 farmers, mostly belonging to Punjab, were martyred while incessantly waiting at Delhi borders, for months together. As if the lathis and the rubber bullets were not enough, none less than the Prime Minister verbally assaulted our farmers by calling them ""Andolanjeevis"" and ""Parjeevi"" (Parasites) on the floor of the Parliament. Their only demand was the withdrawal of the three farm laws imposed on them without consulting them.Singh said that PM Modi had promised to double the income of farmers by 2022 but his policies in the last ten years have eroded the earnings of farmers. ""The national average monthly income of farmers is a meagre Rs. 27 rupees per day, while average debt per farmer is Rs. 27,000. High cost of input, including fuel and fertilizers, coupled with GST on at least 35 farm related equipment and a whimsical decision making in farm export and import, has destroyed the savings of our farm households and left them on the margins of our society. The Congress-UPA government had provided a loan waiver worth Rs 72,000 Cr to 3.73 Cr farmers, increased the MSP, widened its spectrum, increased production, while encouraging exports. All this resulted in double the growth in Agriculture in our period, as compared to the last ten years.""Explaining Congress party's 5 guarantees under 'Kisaan Nyay', the former PM said, ""These include-a legal guarantee of the MSP, a stable export-import policy for agriculture, a Permanent Commission on Agricultural Finance for loan waivers, direct transfer of insured compensation to the farmers in 30 days in case of crop losses and removal of GST on farm input products and equipment. In my opinion, these steps would create an environment for the second generation of agricultural reforms.""Speaking on GDP growth in India, Singh said, ""In the past 10 years, the nation's economy has witnessed unimaginable turmoil. The imposition of the demonetisation disaster, a flawed GST, and the painful mismanagement during the COVID pandemic has resulted in a miserable situation, where an expectation of a subpar 6-7 per cent GDP growth has become the new normal. Growth under BJP Government has plunged to under 6 per cent, while during Congress-UPA tenure, it was about 8 per cent (New Series). Unprecedented unemployment and unbridled inflation have greatly widened inequality, which is now at a 100-year high.""Comparing this with the Congress-UPA govt, Singh said that they managed to increase the purchasing power of people despite challenges. ""The misrule of the BJP Government has resulted in depletion of household savings to a historic 47-year low. Rural wages have witnessed a systematic fall, and wage disparity has led to widespread distress.""Criticising the Agniveer scheme of the armed forces, Singh said, ""Our youth is the most neglected section of society under the present dispensation. There are 30 lakh Government vacancies. Innumerable paper leaks have cast a dark shadow on their future, even as they are forced to wait for recruitment for years. The ""Yuva Nyay"" guarantees of Congress party is a course correction in this regard. The Right to Apprenticeship proposed by us will cross the barrier between learning, training, and employment. We have committed that 30 lakh vacancies would be systematically filled according to a job calendar, half of those jobs would be reserved for women, and we will. establish fast-track courts for paper leak cases.""""The BJP government imposed an ill-conceived Agniveer Scheme on our Armed Forces. The BJP thinks that the value of patriotism, bravery and service is only 4 years. This shows their fake nationalism. Those who trained for regular recruitment were woefully betrayed by the outgoing regime. The youth of Punjab, the son of the farmer, who dreams of serving the motherland through the Armed Forces, is now thinking twice about getting recruited only for a 4-year stint. Agniveer Scheme endangers National Security. Congress party has therefore promised to abolish the Agniveer Scheme,"" Singh added.""My dear fellow citizens, the Congress-UPA government made all possible efforts to help the people of Punjab. The Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor, which is now part of Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, and passes through Amritsar, Jalandhar, and Ludhiana was implemented during our tenure. A new oil refinery in Bhatinda was established in 2011, wherein GAIL's 2200 km cross-country pipeline was dedicated to the nation. We established an IIT at Ropar in 2008 and a National Law University in Patiala in 2006. In 2009, the Shaheed Bhagat Singh memorial was inaugurated at his native place at Khatkar Kalan. The UPA government released to the Government of Punjab for development of Talwandi Sabo and Anandpur Saheb as part of the tercentenary of Guruta-Gaddi of the Guru Granth Saheb.""""Even though there was an Akali-BJP government in the state for most part of my tenure, following true spirit of cooperative federalism, we left no stone unturned in providing the rightful share of resources to the people of Punjab. On the other hand, for five years, when the Congress party was in power, the BJP government at the Centre was consistent in denying funds to Punjab. Whether they were meant for debt restructuring, a legacy issue of the previous BJP-Akali government, or for farm loan waiver, or the pending wage liabilities for MGNREGA.""Heavily criticising PM Modi over his 'hateful, unparliamentary' speeches, Singh said that his speeches are 'purely divisive in nature.' Singh, who claimed to have been keenly following the political discourse during campaigning, said, ""Modi ji is the first Prime Minister to lower the dignity of public discourse, and thereby the gravity of the office of the Prime Minister. No Prime Minister in the past has uttered such hateful, unparliamentary and coarse terms, meant to target either a specific section of the society or the opposition. He has also attributed some false statements to me. I have never in my life singled out one community from the other. That is the sole copyright of the BJP.""""People of India are seeing through all of this. This narrative of dehumanization has now reachedits peak. It is now our duty to save our beloved nation from these forces of discord. With folded hands, I appeal to each one of you to give love, peace, fraternity, and harmony a chance in India. I appeal to each voter in Punjab to vote for development and inclusive progress. I appeal to all the young minds to exercise caution and vote for a brighter future Only Congress can ensure a growth-oriented progressive future, where Democracy and the Constitution shall be safeguarded.""Singh ended his appeal with a quote from Allama Iqbal,","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed to Punjab voters to 'protect democracy and Constitution from repeated assaults' by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Calling the people of Punjab warriors, the Congress leader said that BJP has been targetting 'Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat' over the withdrawal of three farm laws.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110564219,imgsize-1124894,width-400,resizemode-4/110564219.jpg"
"Punjab sinking, youth eye flight with visa power",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-sinking-youth-eye-flight-with-visa-power/articleshow/110577806.cms,"AMRITSAR/JALANDHAR/LUDHIANA: At Gurdwara Shaheedan Baba Nihal Singhji in Talhan village , about 13km from Jalandhar in Punjab, the dreams of those who want to go abroad and start a new life are pinned on a plastic wing and a prayer at ‘hawaijahaj wale gurdware’ (airplane gurdwara).In a state where the measure of one’s success depends on how many of your relatives are ‘NRIs’ (non-resident Indians), the gurdwara gets thousands of toy planes every day which are later distributed to children who visit the shrine.While the gurdwara has never claimed any such divine powers to issue visas, believers like Ravinder Kaur from Raya city in Amritsar district keep hoping for a miracle. Her nephew’s visa has been rejected thrice by Canadian authorities. He filed his fourth application for a tourist visa in the morning and Ravinder brought him to the gurdwara, an hour away from their home, for blessings. “He is a plumber. He has all the required documents and has even shown property in his name. But he has been unlucky so far. I thought coming to the gurdwara will help,” said Ravinder.She has reasons to be hopeful. Her son had applied for a visa to Australia and Canada in 2019 and visited the gurdwara. “He got acceptance letters from both. He settled for Canada and works as a cab driver there,” said Kaur. Now all her children, two sons and a daughter, are in Canada or Australia. She says the travel agency in her city sells 150-200 air tickets every month to these two countries.Talhan lies in the Doaba region known as Punjab’s NRI belt . Every street corner advertises English language exams like IELTS necessary for admission in foreign universities. Agencies pitch their “visa first, pay later” or “full family visa guaranteed” schemes through billboards, insta reels and YouTube videos. There are tall promises of converting tourist visas into a work permit, “full packages” that include admission in a college to getting a job that costs several lakhs.But the harsh truth is that not everyone is flying high. For every successful application, there are thousands that are rejected. So, how about those who are left behind?Punjab, once the poster boy of the country’s success in self-reliance, has crashed and burnt, and how. According to a study, the state’s agriculture grew by 5% from 1971 to 1986 even as Indian agriculture grew at 2.3%. Between 2006 and 2014-15, its output grew by only 1.6% while India averaged 3.5%. It has stagnated since then. The state’s GDP too has nosedived. It topped all states in 1981 and was ranked fourth in 2001. It is currently ranked 16 with a GDP of about Rs 8 lakh crore.With agricultural growth stagnating, few youngsters want to become farmers. Salvinder Singh, a farmer from Ajnala’s Jagdeep Khurd village, an hour away from Amritsar, admits there are no young men left in his village. “There is no work.Agniveer scheme has blocked their chances for an army job. Farming cannot sustain our families anymore. Whoever could afford it have sent their children abroad. In frustration, children are tempted to take chitta (drugs),” he said.Most young people feel ignored by po litical leaders and frustrated by the lack of employment opportunities in the country. Industry too has given Punjab the miss. Once famous for production of sports goods, Ludhiana’s industry has slowly withered away. Federation Of Punjab Small Industries Associations president Bandish Jindal says states like UP, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have beaten Punjab by providing cheap land, labour, and power. “The input costs in Punjab are so high that they make our products unviable,” he says. If competition from Chinese products was not enough, closure of trade with Pakistan has also hit businesses badly. Farm protests have created supply problems.In an example of how states have leaped forward in progress where Punjab has barely crawled, Jindal says GST collection in Haryana and Punjab in 2016 was Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 16,200 crore, respectively. “Now Haryana has a collection of Rs 80,000 crore whereas we are at Rs 20,000 crore,” he says.This is also reflected in govt data for 2022-23 that recorded an unemployment rate of 6.7% in the state as compared to the national average of 3.4%.Lack of employment opportunities is a major talking point in every poll rally, but whether it is BJP, Congress or AAP, there is a public perception that these are empty promises and little has changed on the ground.Twenty-four-year-old Ishika (uses one name) who is pursuing post graduation in Punjabi language in Amritsar, is already worried. “I still have a year to complete my studies but the thought of getting a job is so stressful. There appears to be no options for young people who have stayed back,” she says. Ishika’s brother and her cousin have moved to Russia and Canada, respectively, and are unlikely to come back.In Jalandhar’s Model Town, 22-year-old Neha (uses one name), who started as a sales staffer soon after finishing school, was lucky enough to find a job but without much of a future. As she folds clothes and hangs them back in their racks, she knows she will never be able to afford the international brand she works 12 hours for. She can see the gleaming SUVs zipping past her on the road outside. “My husband is also in a sales job and we both work long hours but there is hardly enough to meet expenses and there is no scope for growth,” she says.Neha tried her luck and filled forms for the police and railway recruitment exams but was not successful. Every year, lakhs appear for a few thousand govt posts which are quickly filled up.Punjab Travel Agents Association former president Kuldip Singh Hayer, who runs Universal Travels in Jalandhar city, says, “Degrees in India, whether public or private colleges, are easily available but they have no value. Unemployment is so high that despite challenges like large amounts of money required, people are desperate to go overseas.” The recent capping of visas by Canada for instance is likely to hit students who desire to go abroad.

Balasore pins hopes on polls to rocket it towards better days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/balasore-pins-hopes-on-polls-to-rocket-it-towards-better-days/articleshow/110577732.cms,"Apart from the defence ministry’s missile testing facility, Balasore , a constituency in Odisha bordering West Bengal, is known for its industries. However, with many factories and MSME units in the area tottering, the development of the industrial sector becomes a hot topic during every elections only to be forgotten after voting. BJP turncoat in BJD mantle is up against two former Union ministers, from Congress and the saffron party.BJP candidate Pratap Chandra Sarangi ’s simplicity, BJD nominee Lekhasri Samantsinghar ’s people connect, and Congress veteran Shrikanta Jena’s experience are drawing crowds to their campaign events.Interestingly, both Jena and Sarangi have represented this constituency and served in the UPA and the Modi ministries, respectively. Adding to the plot, three-time BJP MP Kharabela Swain is seeking mandate as an Independent.Balasore constituency comprises seven assembly segments: Balasore, Remuna, Jaleswar, Bhograi, Basta, and Nilgiri in Balasore district, and Badasahi in Mayurbhanj district. Congress has won the seat nine times and BJP on four occasions, including in 2019. BJD had the last laugh in 2014.Sitting MP Sarangi believes people want change and will bring BJP to power both in Odisha and at Centre. He highlights the need to address corruption, hooliganism, and the lack of development in sectors such as agriculture, education, health, and drinking water. Sarangi also emphasises the importance of reviving closed industries and MSMEs in the region.“Balasore is famous for ‘dhana (paddy), pana (betel leaf), and mina (fish)’. BJD govt could not add value to any of these sectors. People are compelled to leave the state to eke out a living. Democracy in the state is in danger. Irrigation facilities are in doldrums despite having rivers. Farmers need support,” Sarangi said.Former state BJP vice-president Lekhasri, who joined BJD recently, criticised the two former Union ministers for not delivering goods. She has prepared a manifesto for the economic transformation of Balasore, focusing on developing the region as an MSME hub, logistics centre, and an IT services hub. Lekhasri also stressed the need to treat agriculture as an industry to increase farmers’ income.“What BJD promises, it delivers in time. This time, we are getting a very good response from the people of Balasore. Development of this constituency is my priority. I am com mitted to work towards achieving all the sustainable development goals for my area. I am reaching out to all voters of Balasore with this approach,” the BJD nominee said.Jena, who has worked with former chief minister Biju Patnaik, said no new industry has been set up in Balasore while the existing ones were struggling. He highlighted the potential of the CIPET-Centre for Skilling and Technical Support (CSTS) and the software technology park in Balasore, which were set up during the UPA govt. Jena also criticised the state govt’s industrial policy which she said has failed to support small-scale industries and emphasised the need to utilise the region’s land, water, long coast, and tourism potential for growth.“There is no remarkable improvement in the irrigation facility in Balasore. An old canal, the coast canal of the British era, if revived, will help industries, transport of minerals, pisciculture, and agriculture in several districts including Balasore. A big asset has been left idle,” he said.Residents are seeking better irrigation facilities, employment opportunities, quality education, and healthcare services. Ramanath Panda, a 41-year-old farmer, expressed concerns about the lack of irrigation facilities in the constituency.“There is huge untapped potential for irrigation. If the irrigation issue is solved, farmers’ income will increase. People go outside the state in search of employment because we do not have any jobs here.Industries are winding up their operations. Politicians promise many things, but they do not fulfil them once they are elected,” he said. Social activist Pankaj Jena, 48, said the standard of govt school education has been falling. Large hospital buildings were constructed but there are no doctors there,” he said.The largest city in northern Odisha and a significant urban hub, Balasore also houses the Integrated Test Range (ITR) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). ITR boasts missile testing facilities at two locations: Chandipur in Balasore district and Abdul Kalam Island (Wheeler Island) in the adjacent Bhadrak district.The expansive Chandipur range is equipped with advanced technical facilities and features three distinct missile launch complexes, enabling DRDO to conduct comprehensive testing and evaluation of various missile systems.From a Congress-CPI bastion in its early days, Balasore has voted for Janata Dal, BJP and BJD in the past. Congress won the seat six times, the last being in 2009. BJP won the seat four times while CPI won twice and BJD only once in 2014.","Balasore, a constituency in Odisha bordering West Bengal, is known for its industries.

Desi co launches world’s 1st rocket with one-piece 3D-printed engine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desi-co-launches-worlds-1st-rocket-with-one-piece-3d-printed-engine/articleshow/110575268.cms,"BENGALURU: In a big boost for India’s private space industry, Agnikul Cosmos , an IIT-Madras-incubated startup, successfully launched on Thursday the world’s first rocket with a single-piece 3D-printed engine.The single-stage rocket, called ‘Agnibaan - Sub-Orbital Technology Demonstrator ( SOrTeD )’, lifted off from India’s first private launchpad, Dhanush, at Sriharikota at 7.15am, marking the country’s first semi-cryogenic engine-powered rocket launch. It was powered by Agnikul’s Agnilet engine.In the past two months, the startup had to call off the mission minutes before the scheduled lift-off twice — on April 7 and May 28. Thursday’s historic mission, Agnikul’s inaugural flight, demonstrated indigenous technologies, gathered crucial flight data and ensured optimal functioning of systems for their orbital launch vehicle, ‘Agnibaan’, in the future.Agnikul co-founder and CEO Srinath Ravichandran called it the culmination of the team’s thousands of hours of reviews and hard work. Co-founder and COO Moin SPM said the project owes its success to the unwavering support of the firm’s advisors, investors, vendors, customers and well-wishers.Unlike traditional-sounding rockets that launch from guiderails, SOrTeD lifted off vertically and followed a predetermined trajectory while performing a precisely orchestrated set of manoeuvres during flight.Isro chairman S Somanath said: “The Department of Space and Isro congratulate Agnikul. The success involved many firsts, including a 3D-printed semi-cryogenic engine, flight-control systems demonstrating the prowess of indigenous design and innovation. It motivates Isro to support space startups and non-governmental entities for innovation to create a vibrant space ecosystem in the country.”The Agnikul team, consisting of more than 200 engineers, is guided by 45 former Isro scientists. Satyanarayanan R Chakravarthy of IIT-Madras (IITM), Agnikul’s founding advisor, said the firm was proud to present India’s first semi-cryo rocket engine, which is also the world’s most integrated single-shot 3D-printed piece. “It signals the ability to rapidly assemble rockets that is unparalleled.”IITM director V Kamakoti noted the sky was no longer the limit for startups. “Very innovative, first time in the world, deep-core technology demonstrated today by Agnikul – a great inspiration for all young students to boldly take the entrepreneurship route and become employers,” Kamakoti said.The success takes Agnikul a step closer to test-flying its flagship launch vehicle Agnibaan, a two-stage rocket designed to be highly customisable. “It is compatible with the mobile launchpad Dhanush, allowing for launch flexibility regardless of location and accommodating payloads ranging from 30kg to 300kg,” Agnikul said.The firm has plans for an orbital mission towards the end of the financial year 2024-25 and regular customer flights from 2025.Aside from showcasing the country’s first semi-cryogenic engine-powered rocket launch and utilising the first single-piece 3D-printed engine, SOrTeD had another first — Dhanush, established at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Isro’s spaceport in Sriharikota, on Nov 25, 2022.Conceived and built as a product that enables the process of launching to be reliable and repeatable with consistency, Dhanush has two sections: The Agnikul Launch Pad (ALP) and the Agnikul mission control centre (AMCC). Critical systems connecting these two sections, which are 4km from each other, are designed to ensure 100% operationality during countdown.IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka said: “The successful launch of SOrTeD is not just a milestone for Agnikul but marks a significant moment for private players contributing to growing India’s space sector… At IN-SPACe, we are committed to support all young pioneers as they help propel India to a leadership position in the global space arena.”","Agnikul Cosmos, an IIT-Madras-incubated startup, successfully launched on Thursday the world’s first rocket with a single-piece 3D-printed engine.

The legislature or the executive may decide the method for filling vacancies to promotional posts based on the nature of employment and the functions that the candidate will be expected to discharge.""It said the judiciary cannot sit in review to decide whether a policy adopted for promotion is apt for selecting the 'best candidates', except on the limited ground where such a policy appeared to violate the principle of equal opportunity, guaranteed under Article 16 of the Constitution.While deciding disputes over selection of district judges in Gujarat, the bench said the principle of seniority as a parameter of selection for promotion derived from the belief that competence is related to experience and that it limits scope of favouritism.Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala said, ""There is always an assumption that long-serving employees have demonstrated loyalty to employing organisation and so are entitled to reciprocal treatment."" He said over the years, SC has consistently ruled that where promotion is based on the principle of 'merit-cum-seniority' a greater emphasis is placed on merit. Similarly, in the principle of 'seniority-cum-merit', a greater emphasis is laid on seniority.""The terms 'merit-cum-seniority' or 'seniority-cum-merit' are not statutorily defined by legislature. These principles are judicial connotations that have evolved over a period of years through various decisions of this court & HCs whilst dealing with matters of promotion pertaining to different statutes and service conditions,"" bench said.It was quick to clarify that the above two parameters are not mandatory since these are not backed by law enacted by legislature. These are products of judicial interpretation, which evolved while dealing with different types of promotion policies, SC said.""The principle of 'merit-cum-seniority' and 'seniority-cum-merit' are a flexible and a fluid concept akin to broad principles within which the actual promotion policy may be formulated. They are not strict rules or requirements and by no means can supplant or take the place of statutory rules or policies that have been formulated, if any. These principles are dynamic in nature very much like a spectrum and their application and ambit depends upon the rules, the policy, the nature of the post and requirements of service,"" SC stated.","Constitution silent on criteria for granting promotion to govt servants, says Supreme Court.

NEW DELHI: The north Indian states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave with temperatures in excess of 50°C in Rajasthan and Haryana. Delhi on Tuesday recorded its highest ever temperature with mercury reaching 49.9°C. Indian Metrological Department (IMD) has predicted the heatwave to continue for another two days.Rajasthan continued to suffer a blistering heat wave for the 17th consecutive day on Tuesday, with Churu being the hottest place in the state where the mercury touched the 50.5°C mark.In most places, the maximum temperature remained almost 5 degrees above the normal for this season.Health department confirmed three deaths caused by heatstroke in Jaipur on Tuesday, taking the official toll to four in the state so far. Two women from Delhi and Karnataka, both aged 63, and a 40-year-old man from Agra were undergoing treatment for heatstroke at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur. The hospital administration said despite all possible efforts, they could not be saved.Sirsa’s maximum temperature on Tuesday touched 50.3°C in a heatwave-gripped Haryana, where mercury crossed 44°C during peak hours at 18 stations and electrical infrastructure couldn’t take the load. The last time it was so hot in Hisar, the first Maruti car had not come out yet from Gurugram.The next three hottest districts after Sirsa were Hisar, Narnaul and Rohtak, while even the Shivalik ranges couldn’t shield foothill stations Panchkula and Chandigarh from temperatures that baked them like Ambala and Karnal. The day temperature crossed 48°C in NCR districts Faridabad, Gurugram, and Sonipat, which was 1.1-to-6.1°C above normal.The grilled spots included Balsamand in Hisar (49.3°C), Nuh (49°C), Mahendragarh (48.8°C), Jind (48.7°C), Narnaul (48.5°C), Hisar and Faridabad (48.4°C), Jhajjar (48.2°C), Charkhi Dadri (48.1°C), Ottu in Sirsa (48°C), Bawal in Rewari (47.7°C), Rohtak (47.5°C), Mahendragarh outer (47.2°C), Gurugram (47°C), Karnal (46.5°C), Palwal (46.4°C), Sonipat (46.1°C), Karnal outer (45.9°C), Panipat outer (45.4°C), and Panchkula (45°C). Just three locations recorded temperature between 44 and 45°C during peak hours.Scorching heat, cloudless skies and searing winds blowing from Rajasthan sent Tuesday’s day temperature soaring to an all-time high on record in Delhi. While the mercury shot up to 49.9°C — nine notches above normal — in Mungeshpur and Narela, it was 49.8°C in Najafgarh.Apart from Mungeshpur, Narela and Najafgarh, several areas of the city, including Pitampura, Pusa and Jafarpur, also recorded severe heatwave on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature eight to nine notches above normal.With temperatures exceeding 42 degrees Celsius, people are prone to heat stroke, which is a medical emergency characterised by an elevation in core body temperature, often exceeding 104°F (40°C). Doctors say the heat stroke may lead to central nervous system dysfunction. When the body’s ther moregulatory mechanisms fail, extreme dehydration ensues, signalling an alarm.There is little respite in sight in the next two days, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a red alert for heatwave and severe heatwave for Wednesday and an orange alert for Thursday, when the day temperature may witness a very slight drop. However, there’s a glimmer of hope: the capital may receive very light rain on Friday and Saturday, according to IMD.Punjab is due to elect its MPs on June 1, in a severe northwestern heat wave in which extreme highest temperatures have made daytime campaigning hazardous.The India meteorological department recorded the state's highest temperature of Tuesday to be 49.3°C at the Bathinda Airport, which was 8°C above normal. At many places in the state, the maximum temperature was between 44 and 47°C. In Bathinda town, the reading was 47.2°C. On Monday as well, Bathinda had recorded the highest temperature from across the state, at s little above 48°C.The IMD says that the temperature at the airports normally is observed to be 2 to 3°C more than the reading in the plains, since it is recorded from instruments placed at a height. The IMD has issued weather advisory, asking people to remain hydrated and avoid coming out between 11am and 4pm.In Safdarjung, the city’s base observatory, maximum temperature was 45.8 degrees, five degrees above normal, and the highest this year.","Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave.

NEW DELHI: Authorities have ramped up security for the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match scheduled for June 6 in New York after ISIS-K called for a ""Lone Wolf"" attack on the event. The terror group has released a video urging independent attackers to act, prompting an urgent response from local and state officials.Patrick Ryder, the Police Commissioner of Nassau County , where the match will take place, confirmed the threat and outlined the steps being taken to ensure safety.""In a video that has gone global, the terror group is calling for that 'Lone Wolf' to act out,"" said Ryder. ""When you have a game and a crowd as big as this, everything is credible.""Ryder explained the nature of the threat, which has evolved since April. Initially, it was a broad, international threat from ISIS-Khorasan, but it recently became more specific to the India-Pakistan match .""Then it got a little bit more specific towards the actual game of India versus Pakistan but did not name the place,"" he said. The latest development includes a video showing drones flying over the cricket stadiumwith the date ""9/6/2024"".In response, New York Governor Kathy Hochul has directed the New York State Police to implement heightened security measures.""There is no credible public safety threat at this time,"" Hochul said, but added, ""We continue to monitor the situation closely. My administration has been working for months with federal law enforcement and Nassau County to ensure New Yorkers and visitors are safe.""Bruce Blakeman, the head of Nassau County, assured that every precaution is being taken. ""We take every threat seriously. There are the same procedures for every threat. We don't minimize threats.

Additional police officers will be mobilized, and local hospitals are on alert. ""We will go to every fine detail when it comes to the security and safety of the residents here,"" said Ryder.The threat includes potential drone attacks, leading county officials to request the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to designate Eisenhower Park as a no-fly zone for drones.ISIS-K, an offshoot of the Islamic State operating in South and Central Asia, has a history of violent attacks, including a deadly assault on a Moscow concert hall in March. This context underscores the severity of the current threat.The India-Pakistan match is a key fixture in the T20 World Cup, which starts on June 1 with a warm-up match between India and Bangladesh.NBC New York TV reported that the security preparations for the World Cup event are the largest Nassau County has ever undertaken, comparable to those for presidential debates.The British newspaper Express first reported the threat, indicating it also extends to sporting venues across Europe, including Wembley Stadium. According to the Express, ISIS followers are being encouraged to target major events, including the Cricket World Cup, using tactics like drone attacks.""We make sure that we are on top of every situation that could potentially arise. Now to that end, we have taken many, many precautions,"" Blakeman assured the public.Authorities continue to treat every lead with utmost seriousness to ensure the safety of all attendees and participants in the T20 World Cup.","ISIS-K calls for a ""Lone Wolf"" attack on the event.

Stone sculptures found in Sattari showcase the rich heritage of Kadamba as well as the Vijayanagar dynasties that ruled over the region.From 10th to 14th century, Kadambas ruled over Goa besides some bordering areas. In Gulle, a village which submerged under the Anjunem dam reservoir area, two sculptures of Gajalaxmi were located by Vivekananda Puratatva Abhyas Mandal. Both had the royal emblem of Goa Kadamba dynasty .The hero stone that is worshipped in Bhuipal, depicts the influence of the Kadamba art.Rohit Phalgaonkar, associate professor of History, informed that the sculpture has four panels, one above the other, depicting war scenes.The base panel shows a contingent of army and the one above it, displayed the hero defending the troop. The panel above it showed the hero, who had lost his life in the war, reaching heaven and dwelling in the company of divine damsels.The uppermost panel showed the hero worshipping a Shivling, indicating that his soul had attained salvation. It could be dating back to the Kadamba rule.In Sonal-Kadtari, on the way to Uste, there lies the biggest hero stone.Whencontacted Varad Sabnis, an archaeologist from Goa, he said, “It is unique in its art work, depictions and context. Locally, this stone is known as Bonelkarache Pashaan. The engravings of camels and other animals marching towards a war zone are worth watching.”“Art works, execution as well as the theme of this stone carry the stamp of Kadamba rule. There are known references of use of camels in Kadamba military expeditions. This heritage stone needs more attention and recognition too.”The Vijaynagar dynasty ruled Goa from 1370 AD till the 15th century. The Archaeological Survey of India’s museum at Old Goa displays two stone inscriptions belonging to the Vijayanagar period of 1403 and 1408 AD.

US GDP growth was slower last quarter on soft consumer spending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-gdp-growth-was-slower-last-quarter-on-soft-consumer-spending/articleshow/110569714.cms,"Metric Revision Initial Estimate GDP +1.3% +1.6%

Consumer spending +2.0% +2.5%

Nonresidential investment +3.3% +2.9% Residential investment +15.4% +13.9% Government spending +1.3% +1.2%

The US economy grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially reported, primarily reflecting softer consumer spending on goods.Gross domestic product rose 1.3% annualized in the first three months of the year, below the previous estimate of 1.6%, Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published Thursday showed. The economy’s main growth engine — personal spending — advanced 2.0%, versus the previous estimate of 2.5%.The numbers underscore a loss of momentum to start 2024 after continual upside surprises in 2023. High interest rates, waning pandemic-era savings and slower income growth are some of the key factors weighing on American households and businesses.Consumer spending was marked down as outlays for goods — particularly autos — were much softer. Federal government spending slowed, while imports picked up compared to the first estimate. Net exports subtracted from growth for the first time in two years.The downward revision to consumer spending was partially offset by stronger business and residential investment. A key measure of underlying domestic demand known as final sales to private domestic purchasers rose 2.8%, versus the initially reported 3.1% increase.Economists have pointed to the strength in this metric as reason to believe that demand is still strong, even if the headline GDP figure looks weak by comparison.“Monthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion . We anticipate continued GDP gains this year and a healthy advance in 2024 overall,” Nationwide Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin said in a note.“Some warning signs regarding the economic outlook are visible beneath the surface, but nothing that makes us pessimistic about the road ahead.”Alongside its second estimate of GDP, the BEA also publishes data on gross domestic income, its other main measure of economic activity. GDI rose 1.5% in the first quarter, according to the report. GDP measures spending on goods and services, whereas GDI measures income generated and costs incurred from producing those same goods and services.The GDI data include figures on corporate profits. In the first quarter, adjusted pre-tax profits fell 0.6%, the first decline in a year. After-tax profits as a share of gross value added for non-financial corporations, a measure of aggregate profit margins, were little changed at 15.2%.On the inflation front, the Federal Reserve’s preferred metric — the personal consumption expenditures price index — rose at a 3.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, slightly down from the initial projection. Excluding food and energy, the core PCE gauge rose 3.6%, versus 3.7% in the previous estimate.Growth in disposable personal income was marked up to 1.9% versus 1.1% initially. That may bode well for consumer spending and GDP going forward.Economists are looking ahead to the release of monthly PCE data for April, due Friday from the BEA, after reports published earlier this month showed a stalling in growth of retail sales and a slower pace of increase in consumer prices to start the second quarter.Fresh merchandise trade figures for April suggest little room for improvement in the second quarter. Separate data out Thursday showed the gap in goods trade last month widened to the largest since May 2022.Meantime, initial applications for unemployment benefits were little changed in the latest week at low levels.",Gross domestic product rose 1.3% annualized in the first three months of the year. The economy’s main growth engine — personal spending — advanced 2.0%. The numbers underscore a loss of momentum to start 2024 after continual upside surprises in 2023.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110570014,imgsize-1000828,width-400,resizemode-4/110570014.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday slammed the BJP government for the implementation of the Agniveer scheme , claiming that the policy had led to the family of the jawans becoming 'helpless'.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Rahul said that he met with the family of Ajay Singh who had a lifelong dream of serving his nation by joining the army permanently. However, according to the Congress MP, PM Modi shattered Ajay's aspirations by implementing the Agniveer scheme, which limited his service to a shorter duration.""He wanted to serve the country by joining the army permanently, but Narendra Modi broke his dreams and made him Agniveer, and when he made the supreme sacrifice, The government left his family helpless,"" said Rahul.Rahul said the nation would never forgive the government for this 'injustice.'The former Congress chief has strongly opposed the Agniveer scheme and has said on multiple occasions that when the INDIA bloc comes to power, they will scrap the policy.Speaking at a public meeting in Haryana's Mahendragarh, Gandhi accused PM Modi of neglecting the welfare of Indian soldiers under the scheme.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reduced India's jawans to mere labourers with his Agniveer scheme. The Army does not endorse this scheme; it is a creation of the Prime Minister's Office. Once the Congress forms the government at the Centre, we will discard this scheme,"" Gandhi asserted.""We will cancel Agniveer and will do it like it used to happen before.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Who plotted to sell Elvis’ Graceland? An identity thief raises his hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-plotted-to-sell-elvis-graceland-an-identity-thief-raises-his-hand/articleshow/110578652.cms,"The writer said he was an identity thief — a ringleader on the dark web, with a network of “worms” placed throughout the US. In an email to NYT, he said his ring preyed on the dead, the unsuspecting and the elderly, using birth certificates and other documents.“We figure out how to steal,” he said. Recently, the writer suggested, the group had turned its attention to a major target: the estate of Lisa Marie Presley , which last week faced a threat that Graceland was about to be foreclosed on and sold by a mysterious company, Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC. Media outlets often recei ve unsolicited emails from people who make outlandish claims. But this email arrived Friday in response to one sent by NYT to an email address that Naussany listed in a legal filing.In its email, NYT referred to the company’s claim that Presley had borrowed $3.8 million from it, using Graceland as collateral. In the responses, which came from the email address NYT had written to, the writer described the foreclosure effort not as a legitimate attempt to collect on a debt, but as a scam. “I had fun figuring this one out and it didn’t succeed very well,” the email writer said. He said he was based in Nigeria, and his email was written in Luganda, a Bantu language spoken in Uganda. But the filing with the email address was faxed from a number to serve North America.Since the news broke last week that a company was trying to sell Graceland — Elvis Presley ’s former home and a beloved tourist attraction — the Naussany company has been a persistent puzzle. It is difficult to find any public records that prove that the company exists. In Sept, eight months after Lisa Marie Presley’s death, Naussany said it would agree to settle what it described as the debt for a discounted $2.85 million. But the family trust, now led by Lisa.Marie’s daughter, actress Riley Keough, did not view the debt as legitimate. That led Keough to court last week, declaring in a legal filing that the loan was a fiction, the company “a false entity” and the bid to sell Graceland a fraud. At a hearing Wednesday, the judge blocked any immediate foreclosure on Graceland, saying he needed to review more evidence. No one representing the Naussany company attended the hearing.When NYT sought clarification on the issue, the email writer wrote, “You don’t have to understand.” The writer was only keen on taking credit. “I am the one who creates trouble.”","The writer said he was an identity thief on the dark web.

"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down massive global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries.

Hush money trial: Donald Trump is convicted on all 34 charges. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-donald-trump-is-convicted-on-all-34-charges-now-what/articleshow/110577474.cms,"What happens now

The next step is for Judge Juan Merchan to approve the verdict and enter a final judgment. This is usually a formality. Sentencing typically follows within several weeks, but legal arguments can delay this process. Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

It is more common in men and older adults.The expanded approval for Bristol's drug is based on data from a study that showed it helped clear all signs of cancer in 67.6% of MCL patients who had previously received two or more treatments.Breyanzi belongs to a class of treatments known as CAR-Ts and works by modifying white blood cells or T-cells to attack cancer. It is also approved for use in treatment of other types of blood cancers including large B-cell and follicular lymphoma.Bristol expects the addressable market for Breyanzi to roughly double after the recent approvals.To cater to higher demand arising from the approvals, the company is working on expanding its manufacturing capacity for its CAR-T therapies - Breyanzi and Abecma.""We continue to proactively expand our capacity to support increased patient demand and now have more than 100 treatment centers throughout the country certified to administer Breyanzi,"" said Lynelle Hoch, president, Cell Therapy Organization at Bristol.Hoch said the company would take bookings for the new indication within a day of the approval.Breyanzi, like other CAR-T therapies, comes with a serious warning about the risk of secondary malignancies, or cancers, in patients who use the drug.","Bristol Myers Squibb's Breyanzi is approved for mantle cell lymphoma.

"Jury in Trump hush money trial resumes deliberations after rehearing instructions, testimony",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jury-in-trump-hush-money-trial-resumes-deliberations-after-rehearing-instructions-testimony/articleshow/110570627.cms,"NEW YORK: The jury in former president Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed deliberations Thursday after revisiting portions of the judge's instructions and rehearing testimony from multiple key witnesses about the alleged scheme at the heart of the history-making case. The judge responded to a jury request by rereading 30 pages of jury instructions related to how inferences may be drawn from evidence.The 12-person jury, which deliberated for about 4 1/2 hours Wednesday without reaching a verdict, also reheard testimony Thursday morning from a tabloid publisher and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer.It's unclear how long the deliberations will last. A guilty verdict would deliver a stunning legal reckoning for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to reclaim the White House while an acquittal would represent a major win for him and embolden him on the campaign trail.Since verdicts must be unanimous, it's also possible the case ends in a mistrial if the jury can't reach a consensus.In a memo Wednesday evening, Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles blasted the proceedings as a ""kangaroo court"" and argued the case would not matter in November.""The bottom line is this case doesn't have an impact on voters,"" they wrote.Trump, who on Wednesday appeared to be priming supporters for the possibility of a guilty verdict by saying that ""Mother Teresa couldn't bear these charges,"" struck a pessimistic tone again Thursday.""It's all rigged. The whole thing, the whole system is rigged,"" he said. It's the same language he used to try to inoculate himself against losses in the 2020 presidential election and Iowa's 2016 GOP primary.Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records at his company in connection with an alleged scheme to hide potentially embarrassing stories about him during his 2016 presidential election campaign.The charge, a felony, arises from reimbursements paid to then Trump lawyer Michael Cohen after he made a $ 130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to silence her claims that she and Trump had sex in 2006.Trump is accused of misrepresenting Cohen's reimbursements as legal expenses to hide that they were tied to a hush money payment.Trump has pleaded not guilty and contends the Cohen payments were for legitimate legal services. He has also denied the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Daniels.To convict Trump, the jury would have to find unanimously that he created a fraudulent entry in his company's records or caused someone else to do so and that he acted with the intent of committing or concealing another crime.The crime prosecutors say Trump committed or hid is a violation of a New York election law making it illegal for two or more conspirators ""to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.""While the jurors must unanimously agree that something unlawful was done to promote Trump's election campaign, they don't have to be unanimous on what that unlawful thing was.The jurors, a diverse cross section of Manhattan residents and professional backgrounds often appeared riveted by testimony in the trial, including from Cohen and Daniels. Many took notes and watched intently as witnesses answered questions from prosecutors and Trump's lawyers.Jurors started deliberating after a marathon day of closing arguments in which a prosecutor spoke for more than five hours, underscoring the burden the district attorney's office faces in needing to establish Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.The Trump team need not establish his innocence to avoid a conviction but must instead bank on at least one juror finding that prosecutors have not sufficiently proved their case.In their first burst of communication with the court, jurors asked to rehear testimony from Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about an August 2015 meeting with Trump at Trump Tower, where the tabloid boss agreed to be the ""eyes and ears"" of his fledgling presidential campaign.Pecker testified that the plan included identifying potentially damaging stories about Trump so they could be squashed before being published. That, prosecutors say, was the beginning of the catch-and-kill scheme at the heart of the case.Jurors also want to hear Pecker's account of a phone call he said he received from Trump in which they discussed a rumor that another outlet had offered to buy former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story that she had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Trump has denied the affair.Pecker testified that Trump told him, ""Karen is a nice girl,"" and asked, ""What do you think I should do?"" Pecker said he replied: ""I think you should buy the story and take it off the market."" He added that Trump told him that he doesn't buy stories because they always get out and that Cohen would be in touch.The publisher said he came away from the conversation thinking Trump was aware of the specifics of McDougal's claims. Pecker said he believed the story was true and would have been embarrassing to Trump and his campaign if it were made public.The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., eventually paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story in an agreement that also included writing and other opportunities with its fitness magazine and other publications.The fourth item jurors requested is Pecker's testimony about his decision in October 2016 to back out of an agreement to sell the rights to McDougal's story to Trump through a company Cohen had established for the transaction, known as an ""assignment of rights.""""I called Michael Cohen, and I said to him that the agreement, the assignment deal, is off. I am not going forward. It is a bad idea, and I want you to rip up the agreement,"" Pecker testified. ""He was very, very, angry. Very upset. Screaming, basically, at me.""Pecker testified that he reiterated to Cohen that he wasn't going forward with the agreement.He said that Cohen told him: ""The boss is going to be very angry at you.""",Jurors want to rehear testimony from tabloid publisher and Trump's former lawyer. The 12-person jury deliberated for about 4 1/2 hours Wednesday without reaching a verdict.

However, they made their stance clear, refusing to leave the premises until they received a firm assurance regarding the supply of the promised six hours of electricity. The siege continued as the grid staff filed the report, unable to provide any assurance without the presence of responsible Tesco officials.Meanwhile, in a related incident, prisoners in the overcrowded Bara sub-jail also raised concerns about the suffocating conditions caused by excessive load shedding, as reported by Dawn. The approximately 200 prisoners communicated their plight to media persons through their relatives, stating that despite having a meter installed at the sub-jail and regularly depositing monthly bills, they were still subjected to excessive load shedding.

Nawaz Sharif signals peace as India awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/nawaz-sharif-signals-peace-as-india-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110542804.cms,"NEW DELHI: While former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has in the past too accused his own country (read Pervez Musharraf ) of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999, his reiteration of the same on Tuesday is significant because of the timing. The elder Sharif, who is now the most powerful civilian leader in the country, spoke about Pakistan having sabotaged the agreement through its Kargil adventurism while taking back the reins of his ruling party after 6 years, and days before the outcome of the Indian elections.“Once Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests in reply to India’s [then Indian premier] Atal Bihari Vajpayee sahib came here and made a [peace] agreement with us ... but we violated it and it was our fault,” said Nawaz, after being re-elected PML-N president, according to the Dawn newspaper.Nawaz, whose brother Shehbaz Sharif is Pakistan PM, has long maintained that he learnt about Musharraf’s Kargil “misadventure” only from a phone call by his then counterpart A B Vajpayee and that the Pakistani military operation scuttled the peace process he had initiated with Vajpayee in the form of the Lahore Declaration early that year.The latest remarks by Nawaz, who has even otherwise been making favourable noises about ties with India, are seen as significant also because they come in the middle of Indian elections, and just before the results are declared on June 4. “It must be read as a significant signal from Pakistan’s currently most important civilian leader for India’s incoming government,” says former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria.Nawaz enjoys a strong rapport with Indian PM Narendra Modi and it was under him, in 2015, that the 2 countries last had a substantive bilateral engagement, although the comprehensive bilateral dialogue they launched to address all issues, including J&K and terrorism, was quickly undone by the Pathankot terrorist attack.The Sharif brothers may hope to break the deadlock in ties if the Modi government returns next week but, for India in that case, the onus will remain squarely on Islamabad to make the first move as it was Pakistan that recalled its high commissioner and called off trade ties, after India revoked the special status of J&K in 2019.There was a hint of some forward movement by Pakistan in March when foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad would seriously consider restoring trade ties with India. That Pakistan remains conflicted about ties with India was evident again when his own ministry quickly clarified there was no change in Pakistan’s position and that the responsibility to improve ties lied with India. Pakistan officially maintains that talks are possible only if India reverses its actions in Kashmir.No Indian government of course will accede to any such demand by Pakistan, except for working towards an early return to statehood as asked for by the Indian Supreme Court in a verdict last year that upheld the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state. For the Modi government, the judgment was an endorsement of its position that Pakistan is not a stakeholder in the internal administrative process of J&K. Pakistan of course maintains statehood and elections cannot be a substitute to the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. Whether it can show any flexibility on the issue, without recourse to cross-border terrorism, may determine the road ahead if the Modi government indeed returns.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has accused his own country of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999.

DHAKA: Bangladesh forest experts warned Tuesday a key tiger habitat hit by a deadly cyclone had been submerged by seawater deeper and longer than ever before, raising fears for endangered wildlife.Cyclone Remal, which made landfall in low-lying Bangladesh and neighbouring India on Sunday evening, killed at least 38 people in both nations and affected millions more.More than a million people fled inland to concrete storm shelters before the cyclone hit.But it was the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea that took the brunt of the force.The forest, which hosts one of the world's largest populations of Bengal tigers, was swamped, said Mihir Kumar Doe, the head of Bangladesh's southern forest department.""The entire Sundarbans was under water for more than 36 hours during the cyclone,"" Doe told AFP.""All its freshwater ponds, numbering more than 100, were washed away by saline tidal water.""At least 114 Bengal tigers live in Bangladesh's portion of the Sundarbans, according to official figures.Abu Naser Mohsin Hossain, Bangladesh's senior forest official for the Sundarbans, had said he feared for the wildlife if the freshwater lakes were tainted.""We are worried,"" said Hossain.

PATUAKHALI: Tens of thousands of Bangladeshis left their coastal villages Sunday for concrete storm shelters further inland as the low-lying nation prepared for the expected landfall of an intense cyclone , officials said.Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening, with Bangladesh 's weather department predicting crashing waves and howling gales with gusts of up to 130 kilometres (81 miles) per hour.Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its low-lying, densely populated coast have increased sharply from one a year to as many as three due to the impact of climate change .""The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four metres) above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous,"" senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik told AFP.Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level, warning fishermen against going to the sea and triggering an evacuation order for those in at-risk areas.As people fled, police said that a heavily laden ferry carrying more than 50 passengers double its capacity was swamped by rough waters and sank near Mongla, a port in the expected path of the storm.""At least 13 people were injured and were taken to a hospital,"" local police chief Mushfiqur Rahman Tushar told AFP, adding that other boats plucked the passengers to safety.""Our plan is to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from unsafe and vulnerable homes to the cyclone shelters ,"" the government's disaster management secretary Kamrul Hasan told AFP.The authorities have mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers to alert people to the danger.He said some 4,000 cyclone shelters have been readied along the country's lengthy coast on the Bay of Bengal, with the cyclone expected to hit a 220-kilometre stretch from India's Sagar Island to Khepupara in Bangladesh.The state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department said Cyclone Remal would make landfall Sunday between 6:00 pm and midnight (1200-1800 GMT).In addition to the villagers and fishermen, many of the multi-storey centres have space to shelter their cattle, buffaloes and goats, as well as their pets.""Some 78,000 volunteers have been mobilised to alert coastal people and evacuate the vulnerable people,"" Hasan said.Helal Mahmud Sharif, the chief government administrator of Khulna province, told AFP some 20,000 people had been evacuated to shelters in the most vulnerable coastal regions.Another 15,000 people and about 400 domesticated animals have been evacuated in the coastal Patuakhali and Bhola districts.On the low-lying Bhashan Char island, which is home to 36,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, 57 cyclone centres have been readied, deputy refugee commissioner Mohammad Rafiqul Haque told AFP.The country's three seaports and the airport in the second-largest city Chittagong were closed, officials said.India's Kolkata airport closed from noon Sunday until Monday morning ""predicted heavy winds and heavy to very heavy rainfall"", airport authorities said, while beaches near the area have been ordered shut.While scientists say climate change is fuelling more storms, better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced the death toll.In the Great Bhola Cyclone in November 1970 an estimated half a million people died -- mostly drowned by the storm surge.In May last year, Cyclone Mocha became the most powerful storm to hit Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr in November 2007.Sidr killed more than 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage.Last October, at least two people were killed and nearly 300,000 fled their homes for storm shelters when Cyclone Hamoon hit the country's southeastern coast.","Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening. Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level, warning fishermen against going to the sea. A heavily laden ferry carrying more than 50 passengers sank near Mongla, a port in the expected path of the storm.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110437868,imgsize-1149945,width-400,resizemode-4/110437868.jpg"
