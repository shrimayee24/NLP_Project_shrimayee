NEET-UG re-test

will ensure there is no change in number of toppers

NEW DELHI: 60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score, excluding the grace marks. They include 4 of 5 whose score after the addition of grace marks totalled 720, the maximum possible in the test. Marks of another member of the 720 club came down by just 4.However, none of them could match the scores they had with the addition of grace marks.The increases over what they had scored minus the grace marks range between 10 and 40 marks. Although the NTA , unlike in the case of the general NEET, has not released scores, 11 candidates are learnt to have scored 670 or above.These students were among the 1,563 who were given grace marks because they had initially been given a wrong set of question papers and could not get the full three hours and 20 minutes allotted for the test.The grace marks for them sparked an uproar with many led by well-known coaching institutes alleging corruption, leading the National Testing Agency (NTA) to reverse the award of grace marks and give the 1,563 students the choice of appearing for a fresh test or settling for their scores without any grace marks. In the event, only 813 volunteered to take the test afresh.The results of the re-test, announced on Monday, will ensure that there is no change in the number of toppers, which came down to 61 after the exclusion of six whose score had reached 720 after the addition of grace marks.Of the 1,563 candidates, 750 opted to retain their scores without the grace marks. Though their ranks slipped, their original marks; i.e, what they achieved without grace marks, are good enough to land them seats in good govt medical colleges .Allegations of scam gained ground after six of the students who scored 720 were found to have appeared at the same centre, leading the NTA to reverse its decision on grace marks. The change was accepted by Supreme Court .The official statement on Monday read: ""Pursuant to the Order ... a Re-Test was held for 1,563 candidates on 23 June 2024 ..., out of which a total of 813 candidates appeared therein,"" adding, ""It is now informed that revised Score Cards of all Candidates of NEET (UG) 2024 (including of 1,563 Candidates who appeared in the Re-Test on 23 June 2024), are being hosted on the website...""Chandigarh, which had just two candidates registered, saw zero attendance. The Jhajjar centre, which was under scrutiny, registered 58% attendance, with 287 of the 494 candidates taking the test.The NEET-UG exam, held on May 5 across 4,750 centres, saw a little over 23 lakh of the 24 lakh candidates taking the exam. 67 students initially scored a perfect 720, an unprecedented number in NEET's history, with six from one centre in Haryana, raising suspicions of irregularities and the role of grace marks.The NEET-UG exam, conducted by the NTA, is for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in govt and private institutions across India.The agency is currently under scrutiny for alleged irregularities in the exam, including a paper leak, with various groups calling for a retest.","60% of the 813 NEET applicants who took the re-test after the grace marks awarded to them were rescinded have improved upon their original score.

Entire India under monsoon cover 6 days before schedule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/entire-india-under-monsoon-cover-6-days-before-schedule/articleshow/111440961.cms,"NEW DELHI: Southwest (summer) monsoon covered the entire country on Tuesday, six days before its normal date, said India Meteorological Department on Tuesday. It’s the third consecutive year in which the monsoon covered the entire country by July 2.The onset of monsoon over Kerala and most parts of northeast happened simultaneously on May 30 ahead of its normal date of June 1 and June 5, respectively.It covered the entire country in 34 days despite its sluggish progress during June 10-18. Normally, monsoon covers the entire India in 38 days .Early/delayed onset or early/delayed coverage, however, doesn’t impact quantitative or spatial aspects of rainfall during the four-month monsoon season. It, however, guides the progress of kharif (summer sown crops such as paddy, sugarcane, coarse cereals and cotton) sowing operations and choice of crops as farmers have to take a call on the basis of the irrigation cycle a crop may need.IMD records show that this is the seventh time in the past 12 years and 14th time in the past 25 years that the monsoon covered the entire country ahead of time, with the earliest one being recorded in 2013 when it did so as early as June 16 — the day country witnessed a major disaster in Kedarnath (Uttarakhand).Monsoon normally starts retreating from northwest India around Sept 17 and fully withdraws by Oct 15. Besides farming activities, water and hydro-power management also depends on the onset, coverage and withdrawal of monsoon.Though June recorded nearly 11% deficit rainfall in the country, it did not affect the overall acreage last month due to adequate pace of sowing operations in peninsular India which reported over 14% more than normal rainfall in the month.Agriculture ministry data shows that the overall acreage of all kharif crops put together in the country as on June 28 was 240 lakh hectares which was 59 lakh hectares more than the acreage during the corresponding period last year. It happened due to higher acreage of the less water consuming crops — pulses and oilseeds — last month.","The onset of monsoon over Kerala and most parts of northeast happened simultaneously on May 30 ahead of its normal date of June 1 and June 5.

'Overcrowding led to stampede'

NEW DELHI: In a horrifying incident, over 100 people were killed after a stampede broke out during a ' satsang ' (religious prayer meeting) in Uttar Pradesh 's Hathras .Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken note of the incident and formed a committee to investigate the incident.The satsang was reportedly being held by Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba , formerly known as Saurabh Kumar.According to Navbharat Times report, the baba had previously served in the intelligence department of Uttar Pradesh Police.After 17 years of service, he quit his job to embark on spiritual journey as a preacher. He is often seen giving lessons in white suit and tie.He organises satsang programs with his wife and is also known as 'Sakar Vishwa Hari Baba of Patiali'. Hundreds of people usually attend his events.While his following extends beyond UP to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, both the preacher and his acolytes maintain a distance from the media.According to a devotee, Bhole Baba had no religious mentor and soon after he took voluntary retirement from service, he had a 'vision' of the deity and since then he became inclined to spiritual pursuits. He used to hold his satsangs every Tuesday and before Hathras, he held a similar event in Mainpuri district last week.He courted controversy during the Covid pandemic period when he sought permission for a satsang in Farrukhabad district in May 2022 to be attended by only 50 people. However, the congregation grew to over 50,000, causing a major headache for the local administration.As per reports, the stampede in the Hathras event on Tuesday broke out as servitors of Bhole Baba stopped people from leaving the venue amid the heat and humidity, so that the preacher and his retinue could leave first. As permission was given to people to leave, chaos broke out, leading to the stampede.Victims, dead or unconscious, were brought to the Sikandara Rao Trauma Centre in trucks and other vehicles. The bodies were laid outside the health centre as people milled around them.One video clip showed a woman crying, sitting among five or six bodies in a truck. Another picture showed a man and a woman lying lifeless in another vehicle.Eyewitness Shakuntala Devi told PTI Videos that the stampede took place while people were leaving the venue at the end of the satsang. They fell atop each other, she said.The stampede apparently occurred due to overcrowding, Sikandra Rao police station SHO Ashish Kumar said.According to officials, a team comprising the Agra additional director general of police and the divisional commissioner of Aligarh will probe the incident.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the stampede and instructed officials to reach the accident site and carry out relief measures. He announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh ex gratia for the families of the dead and Rs 50,000 each for the injured.","The satsang was reportedly being held by Sakar Vishwa Hari Bhole Baba.

He was questioned about the Bali trip when he was kept in a Jharkhand jail. “CBI is verifying his travel details, his spendings during the duration of the trip, and all bank transactions,” an official said.CBI has already found information of Haque being in contact with the Bihar paper-leak gang. “His call details reveal connections with numerous individuals, necessitating a thorough investigation,” the official said.","New evidence purportedly emerged of arrested principal Ehsanul Haque ’s alleged shady dealings.

Due to large pendency of cases in the courts, disproportionate ratio of judges vis-a-vis population, routine adjournment of cases merely on asking of an advocate and lack of use of technology, more particularly in lower courts, are big constraint in maintaining the timelines provided in the law for deciding cases,"" said former law secretary PK Malhotra.Though Section 346(2) of BNSS gives unfettered powers to a judge to adjourn hearings even after commencement of trial ""for such time as it considers reasonable..."", in Section 346(2)b, the BNSS for the first time limits the adjournments to two: ""where the circumstances are beyond the control of a party, not more than two adjournments may be granted by the court after hearing the objections of the other party and for the reasons to be recorded in writing.""The directives to limit adjournments have been issued earlier too by the apex court to subordinate courts but these are seldom followed.Quoting from the findings of a 2017 study by Bengaluru-based legal think tank Daksh, TOI had earlier reported that an average 87 cases got listed each day before a subordinate court judge, and almost half of them were adjourned. ""This is far too many, given that the judge sits in an open court for only about five-and-a-half hours.

Govt makes a new category of ‘combo’ three-wheeled vehicle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-makes-a-new-category-of-combo-three-wheeled-vehicle/articleshow/111440692.cms,"NEW DELHI: After a gap of nearly six years, govt has added a new category of vehicle, L2-5. This ‘combo’ category of three-wheeled vehicle can be used interchangeably as a two-wheeler or a three-wheeler, as per requirement. These vehicles can now be registered with transport authorities across the country.It was in Nov 2018 that the govt had included ‘quadracycle’ as a new vehicle in the four-wheeler class, though it has not found many takers.Officials said creating new categories of vehicles and allowing their registration are aimed at promoting innovative transportation solutions .The ‘combo’ vehicles can be used for personal and commercial purposes.As per the current automotive standards, the combo vehicles would be electric-powered only. Sources said new standards can be included if any manufacturer opts for using any other fuel. The ministry in July 2022 had initiated setting the standards for this category of vehicles.As per a road transport ministry notification, a combo vehicle “means a three-wheeled motor vehicle, with a 2 wheeler-3 wheeler combination module, constructed in such a way that a two-wheeled vehicle of category L2 is combined with a non-self propelled rear module unit”.Though it’s a detachable combination of a two- and three-wheeler, there would be one single registration number for both the vehicles. But each of the vehicles would have two number plates, one in the front and the other in the rear side.Sources said the new category of L2-5 has the potential to meet the requirement of a section of users considering the flexibility to use the vehicle as per their requirement. For example, in congested areas, the owners can detach the three-wheeler portion and use it as a two-wheeler. Those who run a shop or a small commercial entity, they can use it as a three wheeler to carry goods. At the workplace, they can detach the two-wheeler and use it for commuting.","After a gap of nearly six years, govt has added a new category of vehicle, L2-5.

The case from 1720 that CJI D Y Chandrachud highlighted to underscore the importance of following the rule of law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-case-from-1720-that-cji-d-y-chandrachud-highlighted-to-underscore-the-importance-of-following-the-rule-of-law/articleshow/111439731.cms,"MUMBAI: Rama Komathi , during pre-Independence India, was a wealthy and influential resident of Bombay as it then was, known also for his philanthropy and public spiritedness. Till one fine day in 1720, he stood convicted based on ""fabricated evidence"" for allegedly conspiring with a naval pirate. His case stands as one of the earliest Notable Trials in the annals of law, during the British regime in India.The trial is ‘notable’ not for its fairness but the contrary, as Chief Justice of India Chandrachud highlighted on Monday at an event in New Delhi.Rama Kamath, was better known as Rama Komathi. Some write his name as Kamati.His ties were said to be close with the erstwhile East India Company. He was known to be the only Indian from Bombay to get an invite to the inauguration of the Cathedral of St. Thomas.In his later years, however, he was charged as an alleged traitor and an allegedly dangerous conspirator; and stood trial before a tribunal of the Company. He was charged with being in secret correspondence with Kanhoji Angre. Letters alleged to have been addressed by Rama to Kanhoji were intercepted and seized. The charge was that he had allegedly conspired to seize the then Governor of Bombay and deliver him to Kanhoji who was considered a “menace to the security of Bombay.’’The only evidence against Kamati was “hearsay evidence'' of a girl that he conspired with Angre. Hearsay evidence is not good or admissible evidence. The other evidence was a statement of his ‘servant’ who was allegedly “tortured’’. Based on it he was sentenced to life imprisonment, his large warehouse in the Fort area was allegedly demolished, his properties seized and “auctioned”. He died eight years later in prison. It was later ""conclusively proved outside court'' that the letters were fabricated and the case against Kamati was false, said the CJI Chandrachud.The then Governor Charles Boone presided over the Tribunal, wrote the two lawyers. The legal principle of no man can be a judge in his own case, was given a go by said lawyers.“This case was tried in what might be called a process far removed from the modern notion of rule of law-- where equality under law and principles of natural justice and fairness form the backbone of justice ,’’ says solicitor Dhaval Mehta, of DM Legal Associates who in 2021 had posted on social media an article from another website in 2009 by a Chennai based lawyer Prakash Yedhula on the Kamati case.The first Earl of Chatham William Pitt, and Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1766-678 is attributed to have famously said , “…the end of law is the beginning of tyranny,"" to stress on the importance of rule of law . Kamati’s misfortune was that he was tried when the modern legal systems were in their infancy and he, a sacrificial lamb of sorts, was caught in public miscarriage of justice.Mehta said the case offers crucial judicial lessons. It underscores the importance of ensuring due process, impartiality, and reliable and admissible evidence in trials to ensure justice itself is not sacrificed. “The historical case serves as a reminder of the necessity for robust legal safeguards to protect individual rights and maintain the integrity of the judicial system,’’ he said on Tuesday.","Rama Komathi was a wealthy and influential resident of Bombay as it then was, known also for his philanthropy and public spiritedness.

50k doses of semen & counting: Meet UP’s elite breeder bull,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/50k-doses-of-semen-counting-meet-ups-elite-breeder-bull/articleshow/111374226.cms,"Having contributed over 50,000 doses of semen , Gorakh, the lone Gangatiri bull at the Uttar Pradesh government’s Hapur farm, has emerged a pioneer in the conservation and propagation of high quality Gangatiri germplasm in UP .Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar. The breed, resistant to a lot of diseases and also economical, has high adaptability to the region and lesser input cost.A Gangatiri cow weighs about 300-350 kg and yields 8-10 litres of milk every day.The genetically improved breed, however, may have a higher yield. The breed was registered by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) in 2015.Born on Jan 29, 2014, Gorakh has his parentage verified and that’s what made him qualify as the donor for production of sexed semen (in which 90% Y chromosomes are removed) for Gangatiri breed of cows in the state. The two female Gangatiri calves, which were born at the govt’s Varanasi farm on March 26 and March 27, using embryo transfer technology and IVF for Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, are Gorakh’s progenies. The bull produces over 2200 doses of semen every month.Having a specific ID number, 287020, Gorakh will go strong for at least three more years, says his record. He was born at a gaushala in Mirzapur to Rahu and Pinki, both of whom were elite cows themselves. His induction at the Hapur farm took place in Jan 2015, when he was only a year old. His training for semen collection programme started in August 2019 and two months later, the farm started collecting his semen.Considering that bulls become sexually productive mostly by age of three and may go on to be productive for minimum for up to eight years of age and maximum for up to 15 years or even 18 years, as has been seen in a few cases, Gorakh may have a lot left in him still to give to the programme that he is already contributing to, especially when his record says that he is a bull with good libido and good quality semen.As far as his temperament is concerned, his keepers call him gentle. If Gorakh has been able to donate over 50,000 doses of semen till now, it’s because he has been on a herbal libido enhancer and a balanced diet. His daily diet comprises 7.5 kg of balanced concentrate with 12 kg dry fodder and premix of vitamins, minerals and probiotics. His exercise regimen is also strict and regular to keep him healthy and fit. The farm spends around Rs30,000 on his upkeep every month.It is a tough scan that a bull goes through to qualify as a sperm donor. The first stage is rearing. Many bulls get ousted at this very stage as they may not match the physical standards, or their sperm concentration may be low. The second is the training stage, where the bulls are trained to ejaculate with dummy partners present around to stimulate them. It is the final stage, the collection stage, in which the bull starts donating sperm.There are standards defined for the collection stage as well. The sperm count should be at least 500million per ml of semen for the bull to qualify as the donor. Each ejaculation gives 3-4ml of semen. Gorakh may have already matched the minimum standards to emerge as the pioneer sperm donor for Gangatiri cows. At present, he is the only male contributor to the programme. Officials said that there was one more male, but he died a few years ago.Dr Neeraj Gupta, CEO, UP Livestock Development Board, said, “There are norms defined for every stage. Each stage is monitored by experts. The collection is done scientifically and under the supervision of the experts.”The dummy partners for Gorakh are other male bulls, who are given an artificial vagina, which has a standard temperature of 37 degrees C to provide natural warmth to the male during ejaculation. Gorakh would mount the dummy partners each time he issexually stimulated. The process is done in the presence of experts and it has to be a swift collection of semen. The sperm is flushed twice a week, if done more, the semen quality might deteriorate. Every time the semen is flushed, it gives at least 200 doses, which is 400 doses in a week. Going by the standards, 2 lakh doses of semen may be taken from a bull in its lifetime.Gorakh is ten years but fit to go long. When embryo transfer technology (ETT) and IVF were used to produce Gangatiri cows for the first time in the country, at UP’s Varanasi farm, in July-August 2023, four elite females at the farm were selected as the egg donors, after their records of lactation and parentage were verified. The sexed semen from Gorakh was used to fertilize the eggs in-vivo (inside the body).Later, after about seven days, the embryos were flushed from the donor cows and transferred into four recipient cows, who may not have been of high merit for being merely the surrogate. At the end, because only two pregnancies were successful, two calves were born.The ETT is being extensively used for improvement of indigenous cow breeds at various places as elite cows are used as egg and sperm donors. The standard gestation period for cows is over nine months. Going by that standard, one female may produce one calf in a year, mostly. Through ETT, an elite cow can produce multiple progenies in a year. Ravinder, principal secretary, animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, said, “In the current booming era of Artificial Intelligence, future strategy and better planning on artificial insemination (AI) will bring significant improvement in the entire livestock herd and reduce the risk of financial insecurity of farmers from unpredictable loss of agriculture returns. In the near future, the calf born through AI with elite genetics is going to pay a premium to farmers as predictive analytics can be made much before the progeny comes into production.”","Gangatiri (Hindi for Ganga banks) is a dual-purpose indigenous breed native to eastern UP & western parts of Bihar.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems. They must also conduct thorough scans of all information systems to detect viruses and malware, and ensure that the latest patches are installed after necessary testing.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low!

Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans. It's the same this time”.The regulatory communication emphasizes the importance of banks having robust offline backup and recovery strategies in place, and testing their effectiveness.The official further stated, ""Given the numerous instances of attacks, some of which may go unreported, authorities and institutions can't take intelligence input lightly.""","The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks.

3 reasons why Roman Reigns can return at WWE Money in the Bank 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/3-reasons-why-roman-reigns-can-return-at-wwe-money-in-the-bank-2024/articleshow/111437868.cms,"Roman Reigns is the hot topic among wrestling fans. Fans are anxiously awaiting the comeback of The Tribal Chief , but it won't be an ordinary one. After what The Bloodline did to Paul Heyman , Roman won't spare the squad members. However, that's just one reason for his return. There are also unresolved issues between him and Solo Sikoa that may lead to his appearance at Money in the Bank.Here are the reasons why Roman Reigns can return at WWE Money in the Bank 20241) For Paul HeymanPaul Heyman is someone Roman Reigns has always admired. He serves not only as Reigns' Wiseman but also as a mentor, a role Roman openly acknowledges. The chemistry between them is extraordinary, and Roman has never mocked or disrespected Paul during his time in the WWE. Solo is fully aware of this and understands that attacking Paul Heyman is something Roman would never tolerate. He knows that by targeting Paul, they have indirectly disrespected Roman. Consequently, Roman is certain to appear at Money in the Bank to demonstrate to Solo and the Bloodline the gravity of their mistake.2) War to become the Tribal ChiefBelieve it or not, the war between Solo and Roman has already begun, with the main issue being the position of The Tribal Chief. Roman earned this title through an undefeated championship streak against the top competitors in the business, and the WWE Universe recognizes his spectacular performances. In contrast, Solo has claimed the position of The Tribal Chief without demonstrating the same level of achievement as Roman.There is speculation that a match between Solo and Roman for The Tribal Chief title might take place at SummerSlam 2024 in August. Roman's return to Money in the Bank would signal the start of his rivalry with Solo Sikoa, making it a significant reason for his comeback at Money in the Bank 2024. Upon his return, Roman plans to teach the Bloodline members a lesson and show them what it means to be a true Tribal Chief, marking the beginning of Roman's babyface era.3) The Bloodline vs The Bloodline 2.0The current members of The Bloodline include Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and Jacob Fatu, now known as The Bloodline 2.0, a much more ruthless incarnation than the previous members. Previously, The Bloodline consisted of Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Roman Reigns, and Solo Sikoa. With Sikoa forming a new alliance, Jey, Jimmy, and Roman are now considered part of the original Bloodline. An epic clash is anticipated when these two factions collide.Roman Reigns might need assistance from Jey and Jimmy Uso to defeat Solo Sikoa. While he can handle Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa, Sikoa and Jacob Fatu pose a greater challenge. Therefore, it's likely that Roman will ally with Jey and bring Jimmy along to take down Bloodline 2.0.Recently, there have been rumors about Zilla Fatu, son of the late great Umaga, joining WWE. If this happens, Roman would have Jimmy, Jey, and Zilla backing him against Solo, Tama, Tanga, and Jacob. A clash between The Bloodline and Bloodline 2.0 would be a spectacle to watch at SummerSlam 2024, with the outcome hinging on the Money in the Bank event.",Roman Reigns is expected to return to WWE at Money in the Bank 2024. There are unresolved issues between him and Solo Sikoa that may lead to his appearance. Roman plans to teach the Bloodline members a lesson and show them what it means to be a true Tribal Chief.

Rs 670 crore cost rise for LNJP hospital block: Delhi LG for CVC probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rs-670-crore-cost-escalation-for-lnjps-newblock-lg-seeks-technical-probe-by-cvc/articleshow/111439662.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking note of loss of public money due to “procedural violations”, leading to a huge cost overrun of Rs 670 crore in the construction of a new block of the state-owned Lok Nayak Hospital , LG VK Saxena has approved a proposal to refer the case to central vigilance commission for a detailed technical examination.The LG has also constituted a committee to examine procedural violations which led to the increase in cost.The committee, which will submit its report within two months, will also examine all such ongoing projects in different Delhi govt hospitals.The cost of building the new block was initially pegged at Rs 465 crore but increased to Rs 1135 crore, an escalation of nearly 143%.“It is beyond justification that such huge cost overruns were effected at the level of the engineers of the department though it should had gone to the finance department and the cabinet,” the LG said in his note.Addressing a press conference, Delhi health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj slammed the LG for ordering inquiries. “The LG orders inquiries day and night. What other work has he done for Delhi? The vigilance department is under him. He does this so that the media asks us (AAP govt) questions,” Bharadwaj said.Welcoming the inquiry, Delhi govt sources said if there was any illegality, the officers concerned should be punished. “In his note, the LG is himself saying that the cost escalation happened at the level of officers without the knowledge of govt. We welcome any inquiry into this matter and strictest punishment should be given if any illegality is found,” said a Delhi govt official.“These officers are directly under the control of LG. The vigilance department is directly under LG. He and his department should have been more proactive instead of coming into action after media reports,” the official added.The hospital’s new block, which is being constructed by PWD, will have 22 floors with 1,427 beds and will have a parking capacity of around 400 vehicles. Construction was scheduled to start on Nov 4, 2020 and get completed within 30 months. The LG’s office claimed only 64% work has been completed so far. PWD attributed the cost overruns to increase in the scope of work, officials said. The LG has in his note to the chief secretary asked the directorate of vigilance to request CVC to constitute a special team of chief technical examiners to conduct a detailed examination in the case.Raj Niwas officials said LG wrote to CM Arvind Kejriwal on June 22, 2023, flagging reports of “inordinate delays” in hospital projects highlighting cost overruns running into crores of rupees. They added that it was only after this communication that the health department moved a cabinet note in March 2024 for endorsement/approval of the cost overruns in the case.The LG also mentioned that a dispute between PWD and the private construction company engaged for the work had arisen following which an arbitral tribunal constituted for adjudication gave an award of Rs 82.45 crore in favour of the contractor. However, PWD chose not to challenge the award that further increased the financial burden.The LG has also asked for formation of a four-member committee, headed by retired IAS officer BK Prasad, to undertake a detailed examination of the matter.","LG VK Saxena has approved a proposal to refer the case to central vigilance commission for a detailed technical examination.

"Poverty dips to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12, says NCAER paper",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/poverty-dips-to-8-5-from-21-in-2011-12-says-ncaer-paper/articleshow/111443807.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new survey has estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12 and pointed out that chronic poverty has come down but there is a significant proportion of people who can slip back into poverty due to “accident of life”.Based on the initial findings of the just-concluded India Human Development Survey, it has estimated headcount ratios of poverty using inflation-adjusted poverty line by the Tendulkar Committee, which is used by govt to formulate and implement its schemes.This is lower than the World Bank’s $2.15 international poverty line using the 2017 purchasing power parity.A paper by economists led by Sonalde Desai of think tank NCAER , which was released on Tuesday, estimated a sharper fall in headcount poverty ratios in rural areas — from 24.8% in 2011-12 to 8.6% now. In urban areas it decreased from 13.4% to 8.4%.The estimates are higher than SBI Research, which used the NSSO’s Household Consumption Expenditure Survey to estimate rural poverty at 7.2% and urban at 4.6%. In March, former RBI governor C Rangarajan and economist S Mahendra Dev have estimated India’s poverty rate to have declined to 10.8% in 2022-23, compared to 2011-12, based on HCES. Niti Aayog CEO B V R Subhramanyam had recently indicated that the poverty level could be less than 5% based on preliminary estimates on the household consumption expenditure data released by the statistics office.Desai’s paper estimated that there was a significant in crease in food subsidy through the public distribution system and other benefits through multiple schemes run by the Centre as well as the states.It, however, suggested that the approach to social protection must pay greater attention to circumstances of life, such as illness, marriage and natural disasters, which push people into poverty rather than circumstances of birth associated with social identity or region of birth.Using IHDS data for 2011-12 and 2022-24, the paper estimated that out of 8.5% poor, 3.2% were poor by birth, while 5.3% became poor due to “accident of life”.“Historically, India’s approach to social safety nets has involved identifying the poor and providing them with priority access to various social protection programmes that include both in-kind and cash assistance—however, the nature of poverty changes with economic growth,” says the paper presented at India Policy Forum on Tuesday, adding that identifying the poor is often a challenge.The paper said economic growth and poverty decline create a dynamic climate that requires nimble social protection programmes. “Ensuring that social protection systems keep up with the pace of social transformation will be a key challenge facing India as it strives towards equitable development,” it said.It said that flexibility remains key to ensuring effective programme design that can respond to changing conditions. Rights-based approaches that institute pro grams through legislative acts sometimes create such inflexible systems that they fail the purposes for which they were designed and cites the example of MGNREGS.The paper has suggested three principles for thinking about safety which include universal programs for a limited set of basic safety nets, risk insurance and building in flexibility and institutional framework.It proposed that identifying and keeping the core set limited and fully funded is the challenge. “Massive expansion of the number of programs without concomitant resource increase would render this approach futile,” the paper said while detailing the reasons for making universal programs for a limited set of basic safety nets.",A new survey has estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12.

The accused were hired by the Chinese nationals. We will get lookout circulars issued against the Chinese citizens,” commissioner of police Sanjeeb Panda told TOI.He said law enforcement agencies of 23 states, including Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir, are on the pursuit of the cyber criminal gang , whose members allegedly defrauded several people of nearly Rs 25 crore across the country.“We took the accused on 3-day remand for interrogation. The remand ended on Monday. We found that at least 313 complaints were registered against the gang in different states. While police personnel from a few states have already reached Bhubaneswar to question the accused, we facilitated a virtual interrogation facility for cops of other states via video conference on Tuesday,” Panda said.The scammers, masquerading as courier company executives, called up victims to inform them that parcels in their names were intercepted with drugs or other contraband. The fraudsters immediately connected the victims via video calls to fake law enforcement officials who threatened them to pay to avoid arrest or legal action. Assuming the callers are genuine cops, many people transferred money to the accounts shared by the scammers.","The accused impersonated Mumbai police officers and extorted Rs 36 lakh from a Bhubaneswar airport officer.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

The turbulence resulted in several injuries among the passengers , prompting the emergency diversion, the airline said on X.The affected passengers received immediate medical attention, with some being transported to Monsenhor Walfredo Gurgel hospital in Natal.The Uruguayan foreign ministry reported that several of the injured passengers have already been discharged.A diplomatic source from Uruguay indicated that ""between 25 and 30"" people sustained injuries, although this figure is not yet final. Most of the injuries were classified as ""mild trauma,"" and there were no immediate life-threatening cases, the source added.Air Europa announced that a replacement plane would depart from Madrid later on Monday to continue the journey to Montevideo with the remaining passengers.Air safety experts emphasize the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during flights to mitigate the risks associated with sudden turbulence. Scientists have noted an increase in clear air turbulence, attributed to climate change, with a 2023 study showing a 17 per cent rise in annual turbulence duration from 1979 to 2020, and severe cases increasing by over 50 per cent.Earlier this year, a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX, and two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 resulted in the deaths of 346 people. These events have intensified scrutiny on Boeing's safety and manufacturing practices.In response to the ongoing safety concerns, Boeing announced the departure of CEO Dave Calhoun in March and revealed plans to acquire its subcontractor Spirit to enhance safety and quality control.Boeing is also under scrutiny from the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which concluded in May that the company could face prosecution for violating a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement related to the 737 MAX crashes. The DOJ has reportedly offered Boeing a plea deal to avoid a trial, but victims' families are calling for criminal prosecution and seeking a nearly $25 billion fine.","Air Europa Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner made an emergency landing in Natal, northeastern Brazil, on Monday after encountering strong turbulence.

US inks vaccine deal with Moderna as bird flu threat looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-inks-vaccine-deal-with-moderna-as-bird-flu-threat-looms/articleshow/111437801.cms,"Moderna Inc. secured nearly $200 million from the US government to speed development of an mRNA vaccine for pandemic influenza as a dangerous strain of bird flu sweeps through the nation’s dairy farms, fueling concern about a budding health crisis.The Department of Health and Human Services awarded Moderna $176 million to help pay for late-stage clinical trials that will start in 2025, Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said in an exclusive interview.The vaccine will be tailored so it can target several influenza strains with pandemic potential, including the family of bird flu viruses currently in circulation.Already one such virus, called H5N1, was detected in 136 cattle herds across 12 states and has infected three farmworkers this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nation’s top health officials maintain the risk of H5N1 to the general public remains low. No human-to-human transmission has been identified and vaccination isn’t currently recommended, O’Connell said.“Our job is to be prepared should that change,” she said. “If you had asked any expert in 2018 what they expected to be the next pandemic, they would have said a highly virulent flu.”Moderna shares rose as much as 2.8% in early trading in New York on Tuesday. They are up 18% so far this year.While the focus of the government award is dangerous influenza strains, that could shift should a different pandemic threat emerge, she said.The benefit of mRNA technology, which was the foundation of Covid-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer Inc., is that it can be quickly adapted if the virus mutates. That creates a potential advantage over traditional vaccines, many of which are grown in chicken eggs.Results from Moderna’s early studies of the bird flu shot are expected in the next few weeks. The US government contract is a win for the company, which is looking for new sources of revenue and trying to shake its reliance on the fading market for Covid vaccines.O’Connell said the US wants to help Moderna generate the data it would need to get clearance from US regulators. But the contract, which was made through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, goes much further, she said. It includes options for the US to purchase vaccine supplies, which would be produced domestically and require additional funding.The US has already reached terms with the biotechnology company to ensure “fair pricing” for the American taxpayer, O’Connell said, though she declined to describe the specific details of the contract.Moderna likely isn’t the only pharmaceutical company that will reach a contract to develop mRNA vaccines for pandemic flu. The US anticipates making additional announcements about other awards, she said. Asked about negotiations with Pfizer, O’Connell declined to comment.","The Department of Health and Human Services awarded Moderna $176 million to help pay for late-stage clinical trials that will start in 2025.

Wickremesinghe responds to critics on Sri Lanka's debt restructuring deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/wickremesinghe-responds-to-critics-on-sri-lankas-debt-restructuring-deal/articleshow/111427573.cms,"COLMBO: Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday countered the Opposition's criticism of the cash-strapped country's external debt restructuring agreement with major bilateral creditors and promised to table all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to a parliamentary panel for scrutiny. The planned two-day debate in Parliament on the deal was, however, postponed as Opposition members protested the lack of transparency regarding the agreements reached.Dismissing the Opposition's criticism as inaccurate, Wickremesinghe argued, ""No bilateral creditor would agree to a reduction of principal amount.Instead, concessions are allowed through extended repayment periods, grace periods and lower interest rates .""The president, who also holds the portfolio as the finance minister, said the agreements with bilateral creditors include extending principal repayments until 2028, maintaining interest rates below 2.1 per cent, and extending the full debt resettlement grace period until 2043.Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka's external debt now totals USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt is USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds. The debt restructuring, he said, aims at making the debt sustainable, freeing up funds for public services.President Wickremesinghe said he would submit all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to the Public Finance Committee of Parliament, emphasising the need for thorough scrutiny and broad attention to the matter, his office posted on X.He said the restructuring of debt was to make it sustainable and would make way for allocating more funds for public services.""The country is now able to secure foreign loans and resume projects that had been halted midway due to lack of foreign funding,"" Wickremesinghe said.Foreign lending to Sri Lanka ceased in April 2022 when the government declared a sovereign default.Wickremesinghe acknowledged the short-term credit assistance provided by India and Bangladesh during that period. ""At that stage we were helped by two friendly nations -- India and Bangladesh -- who gave us short term credit assistance. No other country was permitted to extend long term loans,"" he said.Wickremesinghe assured that all debt restructuring agreements would be presented to Parliament once the ongoing talks with sovereign bond holders concluded.Wickremesinghe's statement was followed by the main opposition leader, Sajith Premadasa, who reiterated that the government has failed to secure the best possible deal in the debt restructuring process.","Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe promises to table all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to a parliamentary panel for scrutiny.

"At UN meeting, Taliban asked to include women into public life",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/at-un-meeting-taliban-asked-to-include-women-into-public-life/articleshow/111424273.cms,"UN Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo on Tuesday defended the decision to exclude civil society groups, including women's rights activists, from the two-day meeting on Afghanistan in Doha. She stated that the Taliban authorities were informed that women must be included in public life, despite their refusal to sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format.The UN-hosted meeting, which began on Sunday, is the third such gathering to be held in Qatar in just over a year, but the first to include the Taliban authorities who regained power in Afghanistan in 2021.The talks were intended to discuss increasing engagement with Afghanistan and a more coordinated response to the country, including economic issues and counter-narcotics efforts. However, the international community has struggled with its approach to the Taliban since their return to power, with no country officially recognizing their government.The Taliban refused an invitation to Doha talks in February, insisting on being the only Afghan representatives, to the exclusion of civil society groups. However, their condition was accepted in the build-up to this latest round. The United States agreed to participate in Monday's talks after receiving assurances that the talks would meaningfully discuss human rights.US representatives ""made clear that the Afghan economy cannot grow while half the population's rights are not respected"", according to State Department spokesman Vedant Patel.DiCarlo, who chaired the UN talks in the Qatari capital, expressed hope that ""there'll be new consideration"" of Taliban government policy on women in public life, including girls' education.The UN and international delegations will have the chance to meet with civil society representatives, including women's rights groups, following the close of the main meetings. However, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard criticized the decision to cave in to the Taliban's conditions, stating that it ""would risk legitimising their gender-based institutionalised system of oppression"".The head of the Taliban delegation, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, urged diplomats to ""find ways of interaction and understanding rather than confrontation"", despite ""natural"" differences in policy. He also pressed to end sanctions, saying Afghans are ""being ganged up on"".Russia, which has maintained an embassy in Kabul, hinted it could drop its own sanctions, stating that the Taliban are the de facto authorities and must be recognized as such. DiCarlo said the issue of sanctions was raised but not discussed in depth, as it is a member-state issue whether they will continue certain sanctions or not.","The Taliban refused an invitation to Doha talks in February, insisting on being the only Afghan representatives.

The formal announcement of this new alliance is expected soon. “Agreement has been signed between Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli overnight to form a new government. As per which Oli will lead the government for the next one and a half years and Deuba the remaining time until the election which lies three years ahead,” a senior Nepali Congress leader present at the meeting told news agency ANI.The two parties also agreed on the division of ministries. According to a UML leader, the party leading the government will not get the home ministry. Apart from the central government, the two parties also agreed on the distribution of leadership in various provinces. The CPN-UML will lead the governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces, while the Congress will lead in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will head the government in Madhesh Province. The UML leader confirmed, “The party who will be leading the government will not get the Home Ministry has been agreed. Apart from the union government, the CPN-UML will be forming a government in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces while the Congress will lead the Bagmati, Gandaki and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will lead the government in Madhesh Province has been agreed between the two leaders.”Additionally, the new alliance has established a committee to suggest amendments to the election procedures and the constitution. The committee is led by former Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha. The largest and second-largest parties in the parliament also drafted a constitutional amendment agreement, which states that the Vice President would be made the chairman of the National Assembly.Before signing, leaders from the Congress and UML briefed President Ram Chandra Paudel about the coalition change. During their meeting, the leaders informed the President about activating Section 76 (2) to form a new government if the incumbent Prime Minister, Prachanda, failed to take a vote of confidence after UML withdrew its support.Prachanda, who came to power after the 2022 general elections and has tested the floor of parliament four times, must now seek a new vote of confidence. There has been no immediate reaction from the Maoist Center, led by Prachanda, regarding the change in coalition. However, during Monday's cabinet meeting, Dahal assured the ministers that the current alliance would remain intact.The minister for communication and information technology Rekha Sharma, quoting Dahal, said, “The reports in the media are just rumors. We are still in dialogue with our coalition partners.” “The Prime Minister briefed us on the internal situation and dismissed external rumors. There are concerns about what will happen to this government, but there will be no changes. Some want this coalition to be short-lived, but we are determined to keep this government stable for a long time,” she added.Earlier on March 4, Prachanda revived a coalition with the CPN-UML, surprising the largest coalition partner, Nepali Congress. A new coalition, including the CPN-UML, CPN-Maoist Center, Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Janata Samajwadi Party, was initially formed. However, the Nepali Congress formally withdrew its support the following day, activating Article 100 Sub-section (2). According to this article, a Prime Minister is required to secure the threshold of 50 percent, which is 138 votes as per the present number of parliamentarians.As a result of the coalition split, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also left the government and joined the opposition. Pushpa Kamal Dahal came to power in December 2022 by aligning with arch-rival CPN-UML, after previously forging an alliance with the Nepali Congress for the November 2022 election.The vote of confidence on January 10, 2023, saw extensive support for Dahal, with 268 out of 270 present parliamentarians voting in favor, marking the highest percentage in the known history of the Nepali parliament since the establishment of democracy. However, within three months, Dahal realigned with the Nepali Congress, securing a majority in the vote of confidence on March 20, 2023. In this second vote, Dahal received 172 votes out of 262 lawmakers present, with 89 votes against him, while one abstained.","The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) ( CPN-UML ) struck a deal to form a new coalition government.
