Bullet Train Gets August 15, 2027 India Launch Date, Minister Shares Details On Tunnel Breakthrough

NEW DELHI: A delay of over four years has pushed up the cost of the country’s first Bullet Train project by around 83% to Rs 1.98 lakh crore. The first leg of the project, between Surat and Bilimora, is scheduled to be inaugurated in Aug 2027, while the entire 508-km corridor is likely to be completed by Dec 2029.Responding to a question on the cost escalation for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai High Speed Rail Corridor project being implemented by NHRSCL, at a briefing on govt’s Pragati initiative, Railway Board CEO and chairman Satish Kumar said, “While the final sanction for the revised cost is yet to be taken, it’s around Rs 1.98 lakh crore. It’s still under revision... It will be finalised within a month or two.”Initially, the project was sanctioned at a cost of around Rs 1.1 lakh crore. The project has faced time and cost overruns due to different reasons, including delay in land acquisition, statutory clearances and finalisation of the rolling stock (trains).In a statement last week, railways said that overall physical progress in the project stood at 55.6% until Nov 30 and financial progress at 69.6%. Until Nov end, Rs 85,801 crore had been spent on the project. TOI has learnt that PM Narendra Modi , while reviewing work of railway ministry last month, had directed it to expedite completion of the project.Earlier on Friday, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw virtually witnessed from Rail Bhawan the final breakthrough in a 1.5-km-long mountain tunnel, a part of the project, in Maharashtra’s Palghar district. “A big milestone has been achieved today (Friday). This achievement is the breakthrough of the mountain tunnel 5,” he said.In an official release, the ministry said that it is among the longest in Palghar district, being located between the Virar and Boisar bullet train stations. “It is the second tunnel breakthrough in Maharashtra, as the first 5-km-long underground tunnel between Thane and BKC was completed in Sept 2025,” it said. The project passing through Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli is designed to operate bullet trains at a speed of 320 kmph.The corridor will also be fit for operating the advanced Japanese E10 series Shinkansen trains as it is being designed to allow trains to run at 20 kmph higher speed. Once completed, the corridor will lead to an estimated reduction of nearly 95% in carbon dioxide emissions compared to road transport.","The first leg of the project, between Surat and Bilimora, is scheduled to be inaugurated in Aug 2027.

Underwater tunnel across Brahmaputra gets govt nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/underwater-tunnel-across-brahmaputra-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/126315989.cms,"The tunnel would be of great strategic significance due to its proximity to Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China. (AI image for representative purpose)

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam.

Development won't be at cost of democracy: Cabinet secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/development-wont-be-at-cost-of-democracy-cabinet-secretary/articleshow/126315965.cms,"TV Somanathan

'No change in policy'

Removing hurdles

NEW DELHI: While land acquisition, and forest and wildlife clearances are the main hurdles for delay in infrastructure projects that have been addressed by Pragati, the platform for large projects led by PM Modi, Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan made it clear Friday that development won't be at the cost of democracy.Asked about amendments to the current policy, Somanathan said: ""In a democracy we need to strike a balance... We want to implement projects with the consent of people and after public consultation.""The comment comes amid demands from a section of the business community to review the land acquisition policy to speed up the implementation of projects, with the corporate sector often citing the Chinese model of infrastructure creation.While BJP govt did seek to amend land acquisition law in its first term, it left it to the states to offer a simpler regime. Responding to a question, cabinet secretary TV Somanathan said govt has no plans to change its land acquisition policy.The data shared by Somananthan at a press conference showed 35% of 7,735 issues raised under multi-layer Pragati were related to land acquisition, followed by 20% dealing with wildlife and forest clearances.Manoj Govil, secretary coordination in the cabinet secretariat, said the average time taken for forest and wildlife clearance has come down from over 600 days to around 75 days as learnings from Pragati have been part of the administrative process.Of 382 projects reviewed by the PM in 50 meetings, almost two-thirds related to land and forest. Among the sectors, roads was on top (114 projects), followed by railways (109) and power (54). For railways and roads, at least half the issues are related to land acquisition.In a rare press conference, Somananthan said so far projects of Rs 85 lakh crore have been cleared by the PM-led panel as states and Centre have worked together to resolve the issues. Citing the example of Jammu-Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link, the country's highest-ranking civil servant said the project was approved in 1994 and by the time it reached Pragati in 2015, only 40% of the work had been done. It was finally commissioned last June after being monitored at the highest level. He said had the project not been taken up under Pragati, it would have been completed only by Jan 2038.He said by removing bottlenecks, Pragati had created a platform for higher capital expenditure by govt. ""All states, irrespective of political dispensations, want to complete their projects and all chief secretaries have been very responsive in resolving issues,"" he said.On impact of review of projects by PM under this initiative, Somanathan said on average, one issue was resolved every working day after review under Pragati.Besides projects, the platform is used to review 61 govt schemes such as One Nation, One Ration Card, PM Jan Aarogya Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, PM Swanidhi Yojna, Swachh Bharat Mission, Rera, and grievances across 36 sectors were taken up for review.",Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan says development won't be at the cost of democracy.

New Labour Codes pre-published: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances. Any allowance, excluding gratuity and retrenchment compensation, that exceeds 50 percent of total remuneration will be added back to wages for statutory calculations, while items such as performance incentives.Puneet Gupta, Partner, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India says that the draft central rules under the four labour codes provide clarity on several operational aspects that employers have been awaiting.“For instance, the Code on Social Security Rules specify that gratuity will be calculated on ‘wages’ last drawn, excluding components such as annual performance-linked pay, medical reimbursements, stock options, and meal vouchers. This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126281235,imgsize-360839,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

What the agreement says

Why the annual exchange matters

Historical context

Limits of the agreement

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad. The agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126285389,imgsize-1364220,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Tribunal ruling mum on surplus flood waters, Andhra's projects cut into our share: Telangana

NEW DELHI: Disputes over sharing of river water among states is common, but India's newest state Telangana, while objecting to Andhra Pradesh's Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project (PBLP), has raised an interesting question before the Supreme Court - can a state unilaterally attempt to utilise flood water on an inter-state river? Telangana said the project violates the binding award of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal and would deprive the residents of Telangana their due share of Godavari water, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Telangana said the tribunal award has not dealt with surplus flood waters and AP's projects, constituted in the guise of using flood water, would reduce the Godavari water share of Telangana.No mechanism exists in the country to determine whether a project utilises flood water or the assured share of water allocated to states by the award of a water disputes tribunal award, the A Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt said.Telangana said AP govt's decision to utilise more water through projects in the guise of harnessing excess flood water would have a chain reaction across the country. It said Karnataka intends to use more water of Krishna in the same manner which would accentuate water shortage for Telangana.""Maharashtra has also said that in case AP is allowed to plan projects based on flood waters, it would also like to plan projects on so-called flood waters.This would completely destabilise the utilisation pattern in the co-basin states violating the binding award of GWDT,"" it said.A bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Monday will hear a writ petition filed by Telangana govt which challenged the decision of the Central Water Commission (CWC) to grant consent to AP govt to prepare detailed project report for PBLP even though there had been no in-principle consent for project feasibility report (PFR), which must be obtained prior to preparation of DPR.The Polavaram project was to be executed on the Godavari river as per the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal which was to carry 80 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water to the Krishna river through its canal system for use in the Krishna delta system.""Now, instead of approved diversion of 80 TMC of water to the Krishna river, AP govt is expanding infrastructure of the Polavaram project without any approvals to carry additional 200 TMC (intended to increase to 300 TMC later) of water to the Krishna river and beyond through Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project/Polavaram- Nallamalasagar Link Project in the guise of carrying flood waters of the Godavari,"" it said.Accusing AP govt of undertaking expansion work for PBLP and PNLP prior to submission of pre-feasibility report to the CWC, Telangana govt said AP has floated tenders for undertaking work despite CWC specifically informing it to wait for approval of PFR. It requested SC to stay the tendering process initiated by AP and the ongoing expansion works of Polavaram Right Bank Canal.",India's newest state Telangana objects to Andhra Pradesh's Polavaram- Banakacherla Link Project (PBLP) It says the project violates the binding award of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal and would deprive the residents ofTelangana of their due share of water.

Article 21

: SC

NEW DELHI: Underlining that an investigative agency must be given freedom to conduct a probe, Supreme Court has held that courts should ordinarily refrain from setting timelines for agencies to complete the investigation as it would amount to stepping on the ""toes of the latter"".A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said that courts should step in to impose timelines only if there is delay on part of the agency to wrap up the investigation. ""In sum, timelines are imposed reactively and not prophylactically,"" it said, quashing the order of Allahabad HC that set a timeline of 90 days for the state police to complete the probe in a criminal case pertaining to procurement of arms licences on the basis of forged documents.Supreme Court said judicial directives fixing timelines are warranted only where there is evident stagnation, unexplained inaction or a pattern of delay that cannot be justified by the nature or complexity of a case.Referring to various judgments of SC, the bench said, ""Necessary conclusion to be drawn from the discussion is that timelines are not drawn by court to be followed by investigators/executive right from the beginning, for that would clearly amount to stepping on the toes of the latter.Timelines are, therefore, imposed at a point where not doing so would have adverse consequences i.e. there is material on record demonstrating undue delays, stagnation or the like. ""At the same time, it stressed speedy trial, which necessarily includes timely and diligent investigation, has been recognised as an integral part of Art 21 of Constitution and cannot be ignored as it is essential to maintain fairness and credibility of criminal justice system.""The challenge, therefore, lies in balancing the practical realities of investigation with constitutional mandate that criminal proceedings, from investigation through trial, be conducted with reasonable promptitude and care. It is this balancing role that judiciary plays. It is for those reasons that while on the one hand, there is a statutorily laid down process in place which is generally followed, powers such as that of Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 482, Code of Criminal Procedure, have been kept open in their widest sense possible - to secure the ends of justice,"" the bench stated.Court said the process of investigation is long and winding and legal proceedings also frequently intersect with the investigation and affect its pace and direction, and hinted that it might be difficult to complete a probe within a fixed timeline.""Applications for anticipatory bail, regular bail, or the like can result in temporary pauses or changes in strategy. Courts may call for further investigation, ask for clarification on specific aspects, or even direct a change of the investigating officer. Each such intervention requires the investigating agency to revisit its work and sometimes take a fresh path altogether,"" it said.""So, it can be seen that the investigative process is at times straight, at other times one of lots of twists, turns and recalibrations and in yet others, frustratingly round-about like before it can come to a somewhat definitive conclusion to present the case for trial before the concerned, and sometimes, even at that time the definitive conclusion, at least from an investigator's standpoint, remains elusive,"" it added.",Supreme Court quashes order of Allahabad HC that set a timeline of 90 days for the state police to complete the probe in a criminal case. Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said courts should step in to impose timelines only if there is delay on part of the agency to wrap up the investigation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126315370,imgsize-279710,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court-of-india.jpg"
Rent authority has jurisdiction even if tenancy pact absent: Allahabad HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rent-authority-has-jurisdiction-even-if-tenancy-pact-absent-allahabad-hc/articleshow/126315353.cms,"Allahabad HC

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad HC has held that absence of written tenancy agreement or not furnishing particulars of tenancy do not bar jurisdiction of rent authority. HC has also said that under Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Urban Premises Tenancy Act, 2021, rent authority has jurisdiction to entertain a landlord's application for eviction of tenant where no written tenancy agreement has been executed and the landlord has also failed to furnish particulars of tenancy.HC emphasised state legislature's conscious decision to omit ""fatal consequences"" found in Central Model Tenancy Act ensured landlords were not deprived of their right to seek expedient eviction due to technical documentation failures.With this judgment dated Dec 16, HC partly allowed writ petitions filed by Canara Bank's branch office and others. The issue in writ petitions was whether rent authority, constituted according to the 2021 law, had jurisdiction to entertain applications filed by landlords in cases where a tenancy agreement had not been executed, if not executed, the landlord having failed to file particulars of tenancy with the rent authority.Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal said, ""This provision leads to the conclusion that jurisdiction of rent authority under the Act of 2021 cannot be narrowed down only in cases of written agreement and its intimation to rent authority. Had the legislature thought of giving limited access to landlord or tenant to approach rent authority only in cases of written agreement or its intimation, then proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 9 would not have been there in the statute book.The intention of the legislature cannot be ascertained merely on the basis of single provision, and regard must be given to other sections as well as the context, subject-matter and the object of the provision.""On behalf of the landlord, it was argued the 2021 Act was intended to balance the rights of owners and tenants. They maintained the legislature deliberately omitted the ""consequences"" for failing to intimate an agreement to ensure landlords were not stripped of their right to seek eviction. Essentially, they argued rent authority should handle disputes even in unwritten tenancies to prevent the law's objectives from being frustrated by technicalities.HC observed the proviso further clarified the position to the extent that, in case of failure to present the agreement jointly or failing to reach an agreement, only particulars submitted separately with rent authority by the parties would suffice as to tenancy.For cases where eviction was sought directly under the new law, HC set aside orders that had previously deemed such applications non-maintainable due to a lack of written agreements. While some matters were remanded for fresh decisions, others resulted in eviction orders. In certain petitions, tenants were granted a six-month grace period to vacate the premises, provided they submitted a formal undertaking and cleared all financial dues.","Allahabad HC has held that absence of written tenancy agreement or not furnishing particulars of tenancy do not bar jurisdiction of rent authority. HC has also said that under Uttar Pradesh Regulation of Urban Premises Tenancy Act, 2021, rent authority has jurisdiction to entertain a landlord's application for eviction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126315361,imgsize-10268,width-400,resizemode-4/hc-absence-of-tenancy-agreement-doesnt-bar-rent-authority-jurisdiction.jpg"

How we exercise that right is up to us. Nobody can tell us what we should or should not do,"" Jaishankar told a gathering of IIT Madras students at the launch of the institute's Global Research Foundation.Referring to the now suspended Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, he said goodwill couldn't coexist with hostility. ""It was a gesture of good neighbourliness. But if you have had decades of terrorism, there is no good neighbourliness... You can't say, 'Please share water with me, but I will continue with terrorism'.

NEW DELHI: Former Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Anil Kakodkar has allayed fears that a nuclear device, lost in an avalanche over 60 years ago after a failed attempt to place it near Nanda Devi peak in the Himalayas as part of a mission to monitor Chinese nuke tests, could cause radiation in Uttarakhand and the Ganga.“Absolutely nil,’’ Kakodkar told TOI on Friday when asked specifically if there was a chance of the lost device later causing an environmental disaster in areas near Nanda Devi. The statement assumes significance as reports have resurfaced -- some as recent as last month -- suggesting the SNAP-19-C device of Oct 1965 could cause radiation. The top-secret mission to install the portable nuclear generator was a joint operation of India’s Intelligence Bureau and the US spy agency CIA.Kakodkar asserted the device was “very strong and, above all, corrosion-free”. “So, as per my understanding, there was an extremely slim chance of it getting breached. I know that the integrity of the nuclear capsule was very good so there was no cause for alarm.”The former Indian nuclear chief explained the deployment further, saying “there was a need for power supply for the mission and nuclear power was the answer”.Led by well-known Indian mountaineer MS Kohli, the mission was essentially a response to a nuclear test Beijing had carried out on Oct 16, 1964, at Lop Nor in China’s Xinjiang region.The challenging project was conceived at a cocktail party at National Geographic Society’s office in Washington DC during a conversation between General Curtis Le May, former head of the US Air Force, and eminent American mountaineer Barry Bishop.The story was first broken in US magazine Outside in April 1978 by an investigative reporter, Howard Kohn. It was titled “The Nanda Devi Caper”. India came to know about the super-secret operation when former PM Morarji Desai made a disclosure about it in Parliament on April 17, 1978.Recently, the Uttarakhand tourism ministry expressed fears that the lost device could prove an environmental hazard and requested PM Narendra Modi to take up the issue with US officials.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has also brought up the matter, wondering on social media whether the device “was causing environmental havoc”. A former RAW official, RK Yadav, had expressed similar fears, publishing a book on the subject in 2019 called Nuclear Bomb In Ganga.",A nuclear device was lost in an avalanche over 60 years ago after a failed attempt to place it near Nanda Devi peak in the Himalayas.

The train, marking a major upgrade in overnight train travel running at 120-130 kmph, will also reduce the travel time between two eastern capitals by more than three hours.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the first route of the indigenously built modern train that has a design speed of 180 kmph. PM is likely to visit Assam and West Bengal in the third week of this month. Responding to a question on the reason for choosing the route connecting two poll-bound states, Vaishnaw said the decision is part of PM's thrust on development in east and northeast India under the ""purvodaya"" scheme.The minister said that in the next six months eight more such trains catering to 1,200-1,500 km routes will be rolled out and by December this number will reach 12. ""From next year onwards, production will be ramped up rapidly as the entire supply chain will be in place by then,"" he added.Giving details of the first service, he said it will run six days a week and the one-way fare will be Rs 2,300 for 3AC, Rs 3,000 for 2AC and Rs 3,600 for 1AC travel.He added for the first time, the national transporter has decided to have a fixed rate of fare for each class of travel in these trains - Rs 2.4, Rs 3.1 and Rs 3.8 per km for third, second and first AC, meaning there will be no dynamic pricing. ""You will see several reforms in railways in 2026. This is one of them,"" Vaishnaw said. While passengers originating from Guwahati will be served Asamese cuisine, those starting from Kolkata will get Bengali food.On the special features of the train, Vaishnaw said the riding comfort can be compared with best trains across the globe and the AC system ensures there is adequate oxygen content in air to ensure passengers face no discomfort.Vaishnaw also gave details of progress made in fencing of tracks, upgradation of around 79% network and upgradation in the Over Head Equipment (OHE), the system of overhead cables, masts, and insulators that supplies high-voltage electricity to power electric trains, enabling trains to run at a higher speed. He added that with the expansion of railway infrastructure, they are hopeful of running more trains and they are hopeful of ending waitlisted tickets in some sectors in the next 2-3 years.","PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month.

Kolkata wakes up to season’s worst air as New Year fireworks push AQI into ‘very poor’ zone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-wakes-up-to-seasons-worst-air-as-new-year-fireworks-push-aqi-into-very-poor-zone/articleshow/126297528.cms,"Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness







Kolkata woke up to the foulest air of the season on the first day of the year as midnight firecracker revelry pushed pollution levels deep into ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ zones at a time when cold air tends to hold pollutants closer to breathing height. The only silver lining was the presence of a breeze that dispersed some of the pollutants and prevented the air from turning worse.While the scale of fireworks was lower than Diwali, experts said the impact was far more severe due to prevailing winter conditions. Chill causes thermal inversion, a meteorological phenomenon that traps pollutants close to the ground by restricting vertical air movement and preventing their dispersal.At noon, readings at two air-quality monitoring stations were in ‘very poor’ category (AQI 301–400) and just one level below the ‘severe’ category. The remaining five stations recorded ‘poor’ AQI ( 201–300). Jadavpur, in particular, touched AQI 314, matching pollution levels seen in Delhi at the peak of its recent smog crisis, even as the national capital showed signs of recovery. Salt Lake was not far behind with AQI of 308 while Victoria Memorial came close to breach-ing the ‘very poor’ threshold, recording an AQI of 292.Barely 24 hours ago, AQI at Jadavpur was 159 and Salt Lake 154, both in the moderate range (AQI 101-200).A scientist from West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) warned that fireworks during winter are especially dangerous. “During winter, firecracker revelry is suicidal as far as air pollution is concerned. Low ground temperature causes thermal inversion, suppressing vertical wind movement. Wind speed often drops below 2 metres per second, allowing pollutants to accumulate near the surface,” the scientist said. Experts also cautioned that recovery would be slow. With cold conditions expected to persist, pollution from successive days is likely to pile up in the lower atmosphere, worsening air quality.Environmentalists warned that repeated violations pose serious risks to public health, particularly for children, senior citizens and people with respiratory ailments, and stressed the need for stricter enforcement and greater public awareness in future celebrations.The night also witnessed rampant violations of noise pollution norms, particularly during the first hour of the New Year. Monitoring data showed noise levels breaching 80 decibels in several residential and silence zones—nearly double the permissible night-time limits.Jadavpur University, a designated silence zone, recorded noise levels as high as 84.1 dB, while Flora Fountain in a residential area touched 81.5 dB shortly after midnight. Several colleges and educational institutions, classified as silence zones, reported noise levels ranging between 70 and 80 dB. Under existing rules, the permissible night-time noise limit is 45 dB for residential areas and 40 dB for silence zones.Besides the high-decibel firecrackers, there was rampant use of loudspeakers without sound limiters and DJ music. At Madhyamram’s Deshbandhunagar, Suman Roy’s plea against the use of loudspeakers that was affecting his elderly parents, fell on deaf ears.",Kolkata woke up to the foulest air of the year as midnight firecracker revelry pushed pollution levels deep into ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ zones.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Almost all of that is made up of his Premier League salary alone, which is said to be worth several million pounds per season, plus signing bonuses and performance-related bonuses linked to appearances and results. Moreover, endorsement and sponsorship deals, usual for players of top clubs, are alleged to add to his earnings with specific commercial figures being unbroken secret.Lily Phillips is a well-known influencer and adult-content creator with an active following.

It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing.I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said.

Manus, a versatile AI agent, achieved rapid growth and significant revenue, prompting Meta to integrate its technology across its platforms. The deal, however, carries geopolitical undertones due to Manus's Chinese origins and subsequent move to Singapore.

Meta's $2.5 billion bet on AI agents signals new era

Chinese roots raise geopolitical concerns despite Singapore move





The co-founder of Manus, the AI startup recently acquired by Meta for $2.5 billion, has drawn parallels between himself and Mark Zuckerberg , highlighting their shared journey as college dropouts who built successful tech companies. Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in the same room at the ""Facebook House"" in Palo Alto, California. ""21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,"" Ji wrote following acquisition announcement.According to Chinese media reports, Ji started a computer science degree at Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2010 but dropped out to pursue entrepreneurship. He later returned to complete his degree in 2018. Zuckerberg famously left Harvard University in 2004 to focus on building Facebook, which eventually became Meta.The deal includes a $500 million retention pool for Manus employees, as Meta ramps up its foray into AI. Manus will be retained as a stand-alone subscription service while weaving in the startup's technology into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Manus, which debuted in March 2024 as a ""general-purpose"" AI agent capable of independently conducting deep research and vacation planning, and even coding and stock analysis, reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than a year and gained millions of users.That deal is also not without geopolitical nuances, given that Manus was founded by Butterfly Effect in Beijing and Wuhan in 2022. Still, it moved to Singapore in mid-2025, apparently to hedge against geopolitical risk as part of the U.S.–China tech rivalry.Meta says there will be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” after the acquisition, adding it would wind down services in China. Manus reportedly laid off most of its Chinese staff and now operates with 105 employees across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.Earlier, Senator John Cornyn had criticised Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark for its support of Manus, citing fears of American capital underpinning Chinese technology interests.","Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in Palo Alto, California.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll





The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm.""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. ""The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions.OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion.That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is seeking a Head of Preparedness to address AI's growing security risks and mental health impacts.

Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users.

Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares.

""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Affordability crisis in New York: Zohran Mamdani's focus on rising rents & more — how will the new mayor handle it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/affordability-crisis-in-new-york-zohran-mamdanis-focus-on-rising-rents-more-how-will-the-new-mayor-handle-it/articleshow/126316528.cms,"Zohran Mamdani Takes Oath On Quran In Historic First As New York Muslim Mayor | WATCH

Zohran Mamdani is set to begin a new mayoral term after a historic election that gave him the highest vote count for a New York City mayor in 60 years.After winning with a campaign focused on working-class issues, he now faces the challenge of delivering on his promises as living costs remain at record highs, economic growth shows signs of slowing, federal support weakens and budget pressures mount.Housing remains the most severe strain on household finances. More than half of a typical family’s income goes towards rent, while about 100,000 people rely on homeless shelters each night, according to CNN. In Manhattan, median monthly rents have crossed $5,400. “This is what a full-blown affordability crisis looks like,” Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said in a December report.Central to Mamdani’s agenda is a pledge to freeze rents in rent-stabilised apartments, a policy he has described as his “landmark policy”. Nearly one million apartments, close to half of the city’s rental housing, would be affected. However, nonprofit housing providers and developers operating subsidised units say that existing revenues are already insufficient to meet operating costs.Simultaneously, the rising cost of daily necessities has pushed many residents into financial distress. Around 1.4 million people, roughly 15% of the city’s population, face food insecurity.Child care costs are also among the highest in the country, with a family required to earn $334,000 annually to afford care for a two-year-old, according to US Census Bureau data.Data from Community Preservation Corporation shows that since 2020, expenses for rent-stabilised housing have increased by 22%, while rents have risen by only about 11%. Industry experts warn that the gap between costs and income could lead to worsening building conditions as expenses for insurance, labour and utilities continue to rise.Alongside rent control, Mamdani has proposed the construction of 200,000 permanently subsidised affordable homes aimed at low- and moderate-income residents. Yet financial stress within the affordable housing sector is already evident. “The trends of increasing costs and reduced income are unsustainable for affordable housing,” Enterprise Community Partners and National Equity Fund said in a recent report, calling for emergency funding and state intervention to curb insurance expenses.Beyond housing, Mamdani has committed to free child care for children aged six weeks to five years and removing fares from city-run buses. Funding these initiatives depends on state approval to increase taxes on high-income residents and corporations. New York governor Kathy Hochul has publicly opposed making the entire bus network free, citing the potential $1 billion loss in fare revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Whether Mamdani can turn this proposal into policy will depend on political pressure from his support base, according to Columbia University historian Kim Phillips-Fein. His grassroots campaign has already inspired allies to launch a nonprofit organisation aimed at pressing city and state lawmakers in Albany. “People thought Mamdani’s election was impossible a year ago, but it was accomplished through significant political organizing,” Phillips-Fein said. His success as mayor “will depend upon an alignment of political forces and continued organizing.”Economic indicators present both strength and concern. While opponents warned before the election of a potential flight of wealthy residents or a repeat of the city’s 1970s fiscal collapse, Phillips-Fein told CNN that such comparisons are “shallow”. Unlike that period, New York is not experiencing population loss or a decline in manufacturing jobs.Employment and labour force participation remain at record levels, tax revenues are at historic highs and office leasing reached 97% of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2025. However, momentum is slowing. The city is projected to add 78,000 fewer jobs in 2025 than the previous year, with most gains concentrated in the low-wage home health sector, according to Sarah Parker of the New York City Independent Budget Office.At the same time, a $6.5 billion budget shortfall is expected in 2027, with larger gaps forecast in subsequent years. The incoming administration is “facing a pretty challenging fiscal picture,” Parker said.Federal policy is likely to shape the city’s outlook. Mamdani has vowed to pursue “the most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost-of-living crisis this city has seen since the days of Fiorello La Guardia”, but unlike La Guardia’s era, current federal leadership has moved to cut key social programmes, CNN reported.State estimates suggest that Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill will lead to 1.5 million New Yorkers losing health insurance coverage, 300,000 households losing some or all SNAP benefits, $13 billion in cuts to the state’s healthcare system and 200,000 job losses, alongside higher long-term energy costs due to the cancellation of clean energy projects.Although Mamdani and US President Donald Trump held a meeting at the White House in November, the administration is withholding $18 billion in federal funding for New York City transit projects. Tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced federal spending create a “challenging climate for cities like New York,” City Comptroller Brad Lander said in a December report, as cited by CNN. Meamwhile, Mamdani has maintained confidence that progress is possible. “I’m really looking forward to delivering for New Yorkers in partnership with the president on the affordability agenda.”","Zohran Mamdani is set to begin a new mayoral term after a historic election that gave him the highest vote count for a New York City mayor in 60 years.

Air India pilot found intoxicated; arrested at Vancouver airport — what are the drinking rules?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-india-pilot-arrested-at-vancouver-international-airport-after-being-found-intoxicated-transport-canada-issues-warning/articleshow/126315992.cms,"



Vancouver International Airport saw a major disruption on December 23, 2025 when an Air India pilot was arrested after being found under the influence of alcohol while preparing for a flight to Delhi. Transport Canada has warned the airline that failure to comply with regulations could result in suspension or cancellation of its flight authorisations, reports CBC News.Richmond RCMP said the arrest followed a ""report of concern"" involving an airline crew member. A spokesperson for the said that the pilot had been preparing for Air India’s scheduled daily flight from Vancouver to Delhi. The flight was delayed for several hours but later departed safely. Police confirmed that an investigation is ongoing and no further information will be released.Transport Canada pointed out that Canadian aviation regulations prohibit pilots or crew members from acting within 12 hours of drinking alcohol or while under its influence. The agency said airlines cannot assign crew who are unfit for duty and warned that non-compliance could lead to judicial or other penalties.According to a letter from Transport Canada to Air India on December 24, two breathalyser tests conducted by RCMP confirmed the pilot was unfit for duty after he was advised to leave the aircraft.“This incident indicates a contravention of Canadian Aviation Regulations by the operator (AI) and the crew member as well as conditions outlined in Air India's Foreign Air Operator Certificate,” the letter said.The agency requested that Air India conduct a full review under its safety management system and provide details of corrective actions by January 26, 2026.Sources said the pilot, who had a layover in Vienna, was reportedly buying alcohol at Vancouver Duty Free before boarding. CCTV footage helped police trace him to the AI flight. Due to the closure of Pakistani airspace after Operation Sindoor, AI 186 was being operated with two sets of pilots from Vancouver to Vienna, before a separate crew flew onward to Delhi.Air India confirmed in a statement that the pilot was “offloaded prior to departure” after Canadian authorities questioned his fitness for duty. The airline said it is fully cooperating with local authorities and has taken the pilot off flying duties during the investigation.It added: “Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times.”","Air India pilot arrested after being found under the influence of alcohol.

Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE import sand from Australia despite their endless deserts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-import-sand-from-australia-despite-their-endless-deserts/articleshow/126249828.cms,"Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand to meet the demands of mega-projects like NEOM and the Burj Khalifa. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential. This reliance highlights a global sand crisis, environmental pressures, and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives and innovation in construction materials.





Why desert sand won't do





Australia's role in supplying sand





The broader Gulf context





Vision 2030 and the need for quality



A global sand crisis





Sending coals to Newcastle is a phrase from the early 16th century, describing the pointless act of bringing coal to a city that already had plenty. As ironic as it may seem, similar paradoxes play out in the real world, sometimes on a massive scale. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for instance, are importing sand from countries such as Australia, China, and Belgium, according to the OEC. While the idea of desert nations buying sand seems puzzling, the reason lies in the specifics of construction requirements. As these countries race ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects, Saudi Arabia with its Vision 2030 developments, and the UAE with its skyline-transforming towers, the demand for a specific type of sand that deserts cannot provide has led to a steady stream of imports.This lesser-known fact sheds light on a broader global issue: the growing scarcity of construction-grade sand and the paradoxes of resource dependency even in the most unlikely places.Desert landscapes like Saudi Arabia’s might be abundant in sand, but ironically not all sand is created equal. The grains found in deserts are typically too round and smooth because they have often been eroded by wind over thousands of years.This makes them poorly suited for concrete production, where angular and coarse microscopic grains are essential to form a strong, cohesive structural mix when combined with cement and water ultimately.Concrete itself has three basic components: cement, water, and aggregate, combined in slightly different proportions depending on the intended strength and use. Cement is the powdery substance that reacts with water to form a ‘glue’, binding the mixture together. Because it is made from limestone and processed at incredibly high temperatures, cement production is highly energy-intensive and releases millions of tonnes of CO₂ each year. Some estimates suggest that the global cement industry alone may be responsible for up to 8% of the world’s CO₂ emissions , highlighting its environmental footprint.Aggregate provides concrete with its bulk. Depending on the mix, it can account for between 60 and 80% of the volume of concrete and 70-85% of its weight. Yet the term ‘aggregate’ masks the true origins of this essential material: it is made from a combination of coarse gravel and fine sediment, including sand, which can make up to 45% of the aggregate by volume. Crucially, not just any sand will do—its texture and shape are decisive factors in the strength and durability of the final concrete.The type of sand required for skyscrapers, infrastructure, and urban development usually comes from riverbeds, lakes, and seabeds, environments that produce more angular grains capable of binding effectively. Most natural sand is created through the slow, continuous process of weathering across various landscapes. A glance at satellite images shows just how abundant desert sand appears to be. Yet, despite its abundance, wind-tumbled desert grains are far too smooth and small to provide the necessary structural grip. The construction sector, therefore, relies on sand from quarries and riverbeds, where water-shaped grains are naturally angular, rough, and perfectly suited for cement to adhere.As investigative journalist Vince Beiser notes in The World in a Grain, trying to make concrete with desert sand is like “trying to build something out of a stack of marbles instead of a stack of little bricks.” The nuances of sand composition may seem trivial, but they underpin the foundations of cities and economies. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the world consumes around 50 billion tonnes of sand every year, making it the most extracted solid material globally—yet only a fraction is suitable for construction purposes.Australia has emerged as one of the key exporters of high-quality silica and construction sand. As per the OEC world, in 2023, Australia exported $273M of Sand, making it the 2nd largest exporter of Sand (out of 183) in the world with Saudi Arabia among the importers. In 2023, Saudi Arabia imported about US $140,000 worth of natural construction-grade sand from Australia.Saudi Arabia’s purchase of Australian sand, notably highlights the Kingdom’s reliance on these imports to meet construction standards for large-scale mega infrastructure projects. The conversation resurfaced on social media in 2024, as the trend clearly continues in the wake of Saudi Arabia's ambitious urban development plans, including NEOM, The Red Sea Project, and Qiddiya nationwide.These projects require not just vast amounts of concrete but also the highest standards in material quality, a demand that desert sand simply cannot fulfil.Saudi Arabia isn't alone in this phenomenon regionally today. Other Gulf countries, including the UAE and Qatar, similarly face the same paradox: vast deserts, yet a long-standing reliance on imported sand for high-quality construction. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has increasingly sourced construction-grade sand from overseas to support its ongoing rapid skyline expansion, a necessity dictated by the precise structural demands of complex modern engineering.Consider the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 828 metres. Its construction required immense quantities of materials: 39,000 tonnes of steel, 103,000 square metres of glass, and 330 million litres of concrete, enough to fill 132 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Desert sand, despite its abundance, was entirely unsuitable. Its grains are too small, round, and smooth to provide the fractured surfaces necessary for high-compression concrete, leading builders to import sand from Australia for the project.Sand in the UAE serves multiple roles beyond skyscrapers. It forms the basis of glass production, shapes artificial islands such as The Palm Jumeirah, and replenishes popular tourist beaches through large-scale ‘beach nourishment’ projects. According to the UN , constructing the Palm Jumeirah alone consumed 186.5 million cubic metres of marine sand, effectively exhausting local reserves.A 2024 UNEP policy brief reinforces this reality, noting that the Middle East’s rapid urbanisation is driving significant global demand for construction sand. While regional countries are beginning to explore more sustainable solutions, the persistent near-term dependence on imports remains deeply entrenched.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, a blueprint to diversify the Kingdom’s economy beyond oil is driving massive infrastructure developments. The $500 billion NEOM city, the futuristic The Line urban concept, and other mega-projects require specialised building materials that meet international standards.Thus, importing industrial-grade sand isn't just a matter of preference but often a necessity. Without it, the construction of ultra-modern facilities, smart cities, and tourism hubs would face significant material shortages or quality compromises.The dependence on imported sand is not just a Saudi issue; it reflects a growing global and urgent concern. The UNEP has flagged that the world is facing a ""sand crisis,"" warning that unregulated sand extraction is leading to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, including riverbed erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.In response, some countries are investing in alternatives like manufactured sand (M-sand), made by crushing rocks to create suitable construction material. Additionally, recycled construction waste is being repurposed to alleviate pressure on natural sand resources.Saudi Arabia, too, is actively exploring these options. While there's no comprehensive national policy yet on reducing sand imports, experts suggest that ongoing innovation in materials science could eventually help the Kingdom lessen its reliance on foreign sand.","Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential.

A total of 510 women have sued a Virginia hospital and its executives seeking $10 million each from the hospital for unnecessary operations performed by former doctor Javaid Perwaiz who is already serving a 59-year prison sentence for medical fraud. While Perwaiz's case is well known, the victims have now filed a lawsuit against the executives of the Chesapeake Regional Medical Center allegeing that they were well aware of what Perwaiz was doing and they did not prevent the abuse.Javaid Perwaiz for decades told his patients that they had to undergo some surgeries to avert imminent health danger. Those invasive surgeries included hysterectomies and dilation and curettage surgeries, a procedure used for clearing the uterine lining after a miscarriage or as a treatment for heavy bleeding. In some cases, he falsified pregnant patients’ due dates so he could induce labor early on his own schedule.As most of his patients were covered under Medicaid, the more surgeries he did, the more money he got. He lived a lavish lifestyle, owned five luxury cars and shopped at high-end stores.More than $20 million was billed over 10 years in fraudulent claims. Perwaiz’s actions left many patients traumatized. Some experienced serious harm like incontinence or the inability to have sex.The case was brought to notice when FBI got a tip that women were coming into the hospital unaware of what operation they were undergoing.These malpractices went on from 2010 to 2019 and when Parwaiz was arrested, the hospital distanced itself from the doctor and said they were not aware of his misconduct. His license was canceled in 2020 and he was sentenced to a 59-year prison sentence in 2021.","Javaid Perwaiz for decades told his patients that they had to undergo some surgeries to avert imminent health danger.

Viral post claims Indian-American hotel owners received $1.6 million in ‘small business’ loans: ‘We were sold out’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/viral-post-claims-indian-american-hotel-owners-received-1-6-million-in-small-business-loans-we-were-sold-out/articleshow/126315366.cms,"



A viral post on X has stirred a row among Ohio residents, claiming that a hefty $1.677 million Small Business Administration (SBA) loan went to Indian hotel owners. This raised questions over how American taxpayer dollars are spent amid rising property taxes in the state.The user wrote: ""Here's where your Ohio tax dollars are going. SBA Loan $1,677,000 for Indian hoteliers.""They attached screenshots that appear to show federal spending records from sites like USAspending.gov, linking the firm to properties like the Microtel Inn & Suites in Cambridge. Ownership records indicate links to the Patel family, a name commonly associated with Indian-American hotel ownership.This isn't an isolated case. Indian-Americans have long dominated the US hotel industry, owning about 60 per cent of all hotels nationwide, according to the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA). That's over 34,000 properties, many built through community networks, family savings, and SBA loans accessible to eligible immigrants.From the 1970s onwards, immigrants from Gujarat in India began buying struggling motels across the United States and running them as family businesses. Over time, this model grew into a major part of the hospitality industry, contributing billions to the American economy. However, MAGA activists argue that some loan programmes favour newcomers over local buyers.Social media questions how these loans could be legal. ""SBA loans are for small American businesses, not already established corporations. Why is this legal?,"" asked one user.The person who shared the post replied: ""Good question. They also took a lot of PPP. I have verified yet but this group operates nationally, notably Washington from what I'm finding.""Another user claimed: ""Indian nationals own almost all gas stations & several hotels in NY.""To which they replied: ""We were sold out.""",A viral post on X has stirred a row among Ohio residents.

"Republican slams Purdue University for hiring H-1B foreign national for professor role at $127,500: 'Can no American teach marketing in Chicago?'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/republican-slams-purdue-university-for-hiring-h-1b-foreign-national-for-professor-role-at-127500-can-no-american-teach-marketing-in-chicago/articleshow/126312877.cms,"



Indiana State Representative Andrew Ireland has criticised Purdue University Northwest for filing an H-1B visa to hire a foreign national as an assistant professor of marketing, starting June 2026 at a salary of $127,500.The Republican called the move unfair to American workers and questioned whether there were qualified US applicants nearby in Chicago.In a post on X, he said: ""Taxpayer-funded Purdue University disclosed it is hiring a foreigner on an H-1B visa to teach marketing.""Andrew also added: ""Does anyone seriously believe no American in the Chicago area can teach marketing for $127,500 a year? The same university even has a PHD program for marketing students""The position was posted on Purdue Northwest’s Labor Condition Application and would run from June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2029 at the Hammond campus.Purdue University has been active in using the H-1B program. According to USCIS data, Purdue filed 265 H-1B Labor Condition Applications in fiscal year 2025, with 258 approved.H-1B visas are intended for “specialty occupations” where no qualified Americans are available. But MAGA critics and 'America First' propagators argue that in fields such as marketing, software engineering, and data science, there is an abundance of domestic talent.However, last year, leaders like President Donald Trump, ex-DOGE leaders Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have defended H1-B visas as a necessary source to attract the best and talented people from around the globe.USCIS statistics for fiscal year 2024 show 399,395 H-1B petitions approved nationwide, a 3 per cent increase from the previous year. Educational institutions accounted for 5.6 per cent of approvals. GOP nationalist leaders have claimed that such numbers suppress wages and allow foreigners to replace Americans in the job industry with less pay. This, in turn, limits opportunities for US graduates who want to apply to Ivy League institutions.In another social media interaction, Andrew was told by a user that universities hire the best people irrespective of their origins: ""Universities try to hire the best person for the job, regardless of whether he is American or foreign. Under your thinking, Princeton wouldn't hire Einstein, because they could have gotten some guy from Kentucky for the same price.""To which Andrew replied: ""7.5 million people live within an hour of campus. Do you really think none are better hires as an assistant marketing professor at a satellite campus? If the concern is recruiting Einstein, O-1 visas exist for a reason.""","Indiana State Representative Andrew Ireland has criticised Purdue University Northwest for filing an H-1B visa to hire a foreign national as an assistant professor of marketing.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.
