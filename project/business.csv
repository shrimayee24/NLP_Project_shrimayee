India needs $22tn for net zero by 2070; coal use to rise till 2047: Niti Aayog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-needs-22tn-for-net-zero-by-2070-coal-use-to-rise-till-2047-niti-aayog/articleshow/128139161.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India is working on its 2035 climate action targets, the govt’s think tank, Niti Aayog, on Monday released a roadmap to achieve the country’s ‘net zero’ emission goal by 2070, noting that the transition will need cumulative investment requirements of $22.7 trillion, around $500 billion annually, to finance several “high-level actions” to meet the twin objectives of ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed India) and long-term carbon neutrality. It said at least $6 trillion out of the total investment requirement needs to come from external sources.The govt think tank also underlined that India’s coal consumption will continue to rise till 2047, giving enough hint of what India’s updated climate action - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) - for 2035 would look like.The roadmap - Scenarios Towards ‘Viksit Bharat’ and Net Zero: An Overview - emphasised India’s vision of becoming a developed economy by 2047 and achieving ‘net zero’ emissions by 2070, saying it will require a “delicate balancing act”.“Many of the technologies needed for net zero have yet to reach commercial maturity, while mature low-carbon technologies often demand large up-front investments,” the report said, referring to challenges.Noting a scenario of transition to clean energy in India, the report flagged that the non-fossil fuel power generation (including captive) share is expected to increase from 23% in 2025 to 65% in the current policy scenario and 80% in the ‘net zero’ scenario by 2050.“It is further expected to rise above 80% by 2070 in the current policy scenario, and to 100% in the ‘net zero’ scenario, it said.“The ‘net zero’ strategy is simple – first, electrify energy use. Two, green and clean electricity. Three, control demand through Mission LiFE. Four, focus on circularity and efficiency. Last, cheaper external finance is needed. Clearly stated, India’s coal consumption will go up till 2047 even as energy intensity decreases and efficiency goes up, while meeting ‘net zero’ goals. India can leapfrog to be a global leader in clean technologies. 85% of India of 2047 is yet to be built and can be built to be climate-friendly,” said B.V.R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog, on the occasion of the release of the report.Besides focus on clean energy, the roadmap’s high-level actions for India’s ‘net zero’ transition include focus on circularity, urban mobility, efficient buildings, proper land use, critical minerals, and robust data for monitoring, reporting & verification (MRV) systems as core infrastructure.On financing the transition, it noted that the power sector alone accounts for over half of total needs ($22.7 trillion), reflecting its central role in enabling economy-wide electrification and the expansion of low-carbon generation.“On an annualised basis, this cumulative requirement translates into average flows of approximately $500 billion per year, compared with actual annual investment of around $135 billion in 2024, of which only $70–80 billion currently supports clean energy,” the report said.Of this total, approximately $8 trillion must be front-loaded by 2050, including nearly $5 trillion in the power sector, given the capital-intensive nature of most low-carbon technologies, it added.The think tank noted that the financing gap of $6.5 trillion remains, as an estimated aggregate flow of only $16.2 trillion is expected against the ‘net zero’ scenario investment requirement of $22.7 trillion, and suggested having a ""National Green Finance Institution"" in the country to take care of the needs.It, at the same time, expressed confidence in India’s approach, saying India’s 'net zero' transition will create a new ‘Indian Development Model’ combining economic vitality, technological leadership, and sustainability. “The pathways India shows will be a lighthouse for the developing world. The Indian Development Model will set the trend for others,” said the think tank.“NITI Aayog has undertaken a comprehensive and rigorous exercise that will serve as a benchmark – a starting point for future discussions on ‘Viksit Bharat’ and ‘net zero’. The reports are a great resource for policymakers and researchers on charting India’s course to these twin objectives,” said V Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Advisor to the government.The report has come out with 11 reports that detail the findings of India’s first government-led, multi-sectoral, integrated study to assess development scenarios that deliver on the Viksit Bharat 2047 while simultaneously reducing net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to zero by 2070.The study entails a “scenario-based analytic modelling exercise” that integrates economic growth, India’s development priorities, and climate commitments. It has been prepared by 10 inter-ministerial working groups that examined long-term transition scenarios across key domains like macroeconomic aspects of the transition, sectoral low-carbon transition in power, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture; financing for climate action; critical minerals; R&D and manufacturing; and the social implications of the transition.","Niti Aayog released a roadmap to achieve the country’s ‘net zero’ emission goal by 2070.

What are air taxis and how will they work in India? CII report explains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-are-air-taxis-and-how-will-they-work-in-india-cii-report-explains/articleshow/128137114.cms,"NEW DELHI: A pilot air taxi corridor linking Gurugram, Connaught Place and Jewar International Airport could sharply reduce travel time in the National Capital Region, according to a new report by the Confederation of Indian Industry. The study says Advanced Air Mobility solutions, including Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft, could help India ease infrastructure bottlenecks by shifting a share of urban travel to low-altitude airspace.The report proposes that air taxis initially operate from rooftops of hospitals and commercial buildings and be deployed for time-sensitive missions such as medical logistics and organ transport. Strategic co-location with hospitals, metro stations and business districts would allow integration with existing transport networks, it said.Citing severe pressure on surface transport, the report argues that Advanced Air Mobility is the logical next step for Indian cities. It suggests setting up a new regulatory body within the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to oversee the rollout of these services.Released by Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu Kinjarapu, the report outlines a phased plan to safely integrate next-generation air mobility into the aviation ecosystem and address urban congestion.Senior officials including DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai and Airports Authority of India chairman Vipin Kumar were present at the launch, along with industry leaders.On infrastructure, the report makes a strong case for rooftop vertiports in major metros. “As India prepares Advanced Air Mobility, rooftop vertiports offer an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution, especially in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru,” it said. With land acquisition for ground-based vertiports proving expensive and slow, rooftops of commercial hubs, hospitals, tech parks and residential towers are seen as a practical alternative using under-utilised real estate.However, regulatory hurdles remain. “Under the current DGCA regulations, routine commercial vertical take-offs and landings from rooftops are not yet permitted, and any future enablement would be subject to the evolution of applicable regulatory frameworks and safety assessments,” the report noted. It proposes a sequenced rollout starting with drone deliveries, followed by medical logistics and organ transport, and later air ambulance services.On funding, the report calls on public financial institutions, including SIDBI, banks and government grant agencies, to create dedicated financing instruments for Advanced Air Mobility. These could include sector-specific infrastructure funds, venture leasing models or credit enhancement facilities to lower investment risk and support long-term capital flows.","A pilot air taxi corridor linking Gurugram, Connaught Place and Jewar International Airport could sharply reduce travel time in the National Capital Region.

"Read, think, don't scroll: PM Modi recalls learning from TOI in Pariksha Pe Charcha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/read-think-dont-scroll-pm-modi-recalls-learning-from-toi-in-pariksha-pe-charcha/articleshow/128132083.cms,"NEW DELHI: Long before smartphones, search engines and AI entered classrooms, PM Modi said one habit shaped his thinking as a student - reading the newspaper and discussing ideas. Recalling his school days, Modi told students that a teacher once gave him a daily task rooted in curiosity and discipline. ""My teacher used to tell us daily, 'Go to the library. In The Times of India , there is a sentence on the edit page - write that in your notebook and come,' and the next day we used to discuss it,"" he said, underlining the role of reading and reflection in learning.The PM was speaking during the second episode of the ninth edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026, where he interacted with students from Coimbatore, Raipur, Guwahati and Devmogra in Gujarat. Using personal anecdotes and simple examples, Modi urged students to build habits that strengthen thinking, rather than becoming dependent on shortcuts.Warning against overuse of technology, he said mobile phones have become ""masters"" for some children. ""Some kids cannot even eat food unless they are watching a smartphone or television,"" he observed. He said every era has faced fears over new technologies, but technology must not become the master of human life.On AI, Modi advised balance over blind dependence, saying AI should be used for guidance and value addition, not as a substitute for learning. He noted that nature of jobs will keep changing, just as transport once moved from carts to airplanes.The PM also shared practical tips for exams, stressing preparation and rest. He said a good night's sleep keeps students cheerful and encouraged practising previous years' papers and focusing on writing.He cautioned parents against encouraging comparisons at home, saying constant comparison creates pressure rather than motivation. On leadership, Modi said it begins with courage and initiative.Expressing happiness that students carry the dream of Viksit Bharat 2047, Modi said small habits build a developed nation. Launched in 2018, Pariksha Pe Charcha has grown into a major student engagement programme. The ninth edition, held this year, recorded participation from across the country, reflecting sustained student enthusiasm nationwide overall.","PM Modi was speaking during the second episode of the ninth edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026.

"ED forms SIT to probe Anil Ambani, summons wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-forms-sit-to-probe-anil-ambani-summons-wife/articleshow/128130890.cms,"On SC directive, CBI and ED may file multiple cases against Anil



NEW DELHI: Complying with the Supreme Court's directive, Enforcement Directorate has set up a special investigation team to probe money laundering cases allegedly involving Rs 40,000 crore against Anil Ambani and companies of Reliance Group.The move comes amid ED stepping up its probe against the industrialist. The agency was set to question his wife, Tina Ambani, on Monday at its HQ here but she did not appear and may be summoned again.The purpose of the planned questioning is to establish the money trail in a case related to purchase of an apartment worth Rs 70 crore in Manhattan, New York, for which senior Reliance executive and Ambani confidant Punit Garg was arrested last week.Tina Ambani did not appear and may be summoned again.Tina Ambani’s name came up during the custodial interrogation of Garg. With Supreme Court on Feb 4 asking for registration of separate cases in each case of the alleged diversion of bank loans by Anil Ambani’s companies, both CBI and ED are looking to file multiple cases against him. CBI, in particular, will be required to file many more since the allegations of fund diversion concern more than a score of loans he took from different financial institutions.The Manhattan apartment, sources suspect, had been purchased using alleged proceeds of crime siphoned off from the bank loans that Reliance Communication had received from an SBI-led consortium. ED has come across a network of shell entities involved in money laundering, including the one that received the sale proceeds ($8.3 million) of the Manhattan apartment “remitted from the US under the guise of a sham investment arrangement with a Dubai-based entity controlled by a Pakistan-linked individual”.So far, during its probe against Anil Ambani and his entities, ED has searched 46 premises and attached 204 properties valued at over Rs 12,000 crore. ED has registered three enforcement case investigation reports, equivalent to police FIRs, under PMLA against Ambani and his entities so far.One is against Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Ltd (RHFL) in the Yes Bank money laundering case. The agency has told SC that RHFL had borrowed public funds from 33 banks/financial institutions and committed a default of over Rs 5,400 crore which constitutes proceeds of crime. The 33 lenders were able to recover only Rs 2,116.9 crore. “As regards the default committed by RCFL, 21 banks/financial institutions faced defaults of Rs 6,281 crore. Out of Rs 8,226 crore, only a sum of Rs 1,945 crore has been paid,” ED told the court. In second ECIR against Reliance Communications Ltd, ED has said total outstanding amount was Rs 40,185 crore that constitutes proceeds of crime. Third case is against Reliance Power Ltd in which allegedly forged bank guarantees were submitted. Three accused were helld in the case.“Having gone through ED’s counter affidavit, it appears to us that the aforesaid agency ought to look into every possible financial transaction which might have led to siphoning of funds and must determine the estimated value of the proceeds of crime. ED is well advised to constitute an SIT,” SC had said in its Feb 4 order. SC posted the matter for hearing on March 10."," Enforcement Directorate has set up a special investigation team to probe money laundering cases allegedly involving Anil Ambani and companies of Reliance Group.

NEET-PG cut-off: Single-digit scores land PG seats in top med colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-single-digit-scores-land-pg-seats-in-top-med-colleges/articleshow/128086922.cms,"Removing cut-offs altogether risks patient safety , says doc



NEW DELHI: A steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores - including in high-risk clinical specialties - triggering alarm across the medical fraternity, reports Anuja Jaiswal.The impact was stark in third-round PG counselling, where candidates secured seats in govt medical colleges with scores ranging from single digits to double digits, spanning both clinical and non-clinical disciplines. Even premier institutions and core clinical branches saw seats being allotted to candidates with such scores.An MS orthopaedics seat at a govt institute in Rohtak was allotted to a candidate with just 4 marks out of 800, while obstetrics and gynaecology at a premier Delhi medical college went to a candidate who scored 44 marks. A general surgery seat was filled at 47 marks.This signals a serious breakdown in medical education and workforce planning,” said a senior faculty member at a govt medical college. “Orthopaedics has traditionally been among the most demanding surgical specialties. Filling it at near-zero scores is a sign not of weaker students but a system under severe strain.”This happened following the sharp lowering of NEET-PG qualifying standards by Union health ministry for the 2025–26 academic session, with drastically reduced cut-offs across categories allowing candidates with extremely low — and even negative — scores to qualify.The effect was visible across disciplines. Seats were filled at 10 marks in transfusion medicine, 11 marks in anatomy, and minus 8 marks in biochemistry, many under reserved and PwD categories. While the revised cut-offs ensured that seats did not remain vacant, doctors warn the policy risks trading competence for convenience.“Allowing surgical and clinical branches to be filled at zero or near-zero percentile represents a serious erosion of standards,” said a senior doctor at a govt medical college. “Marks as low as 4, 11, 44 or 47 out of 800 point to a lack of basic aptitude. Removing cut-offs altogether directly risks patient safety.”The current policy marks a sharp shift from govt’s earlier stand. In July 2022, opposing a plea to lower NEET-PG cut-offs in Delhi HC, Centre had argued that minimum qualifying percentiles were essential to maintain education standards. The court agreed, warning that lowering medical education standards could “wreak havoc on society”, as medicine involved matters of life and death.Defending the present framework, a senior health ministry official said PG seats are allotted strictly under revised eligibility rules, and competence is intended to be ensured through training and exit exams, not entry cut-offs alone. Colleges are certified by regulators and are responsible for failing unsuitable candidates, the official said.Medical educators, however, say the trend reflects deeper structural problems — rapid seat expansion without a matching rise in trained faculty, overcrowded classrooms and eroding bedside skills. “Without strong faculty, robust exit exams and a system to weed out unsuitable candidates, anyone who enters medicine eventually gets a degree,” said a senior academician.Faculty members say the consequences are already visible. Many postgraduate students arrive without strong theoretical foundations, clinical skills or discipline. Pressure to pass students, weak exit mechanisms and over-reliance on online learning have further diluted training quality.“Easy entry has reduced seriousness even at top institutions,” said another doctor on condition of anonymity. “Numbers are rising, but training quality is falling — and that poses long-term risks to patient care.”Doctors caution that the branch of medicine does not reveal its failures immediately. Gaps in training today may surface years later, when these doctors practise independently — with serious implications for patient safety and public trust in the healthcare system.","St steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores.

New Income Tax Rules 2026 likely to be notified in March: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/new-income-tax-rules-2026-likely-to-be-notified-in-march-report/articleshow/128111047.cms,"Budget 2026 Brings New Income Tax Act From April With No Slab Change But Major Compliance Reset

The Income Tax Department is likely to notify the draft Income Tax Rules, 2026 and the accompanying forms in the first week of March, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) sources told ET.The new rules are aligned with the Income Tax Act, 2025, which is scheduled to come into force from April 1, 2026, and will replace the existing Income Tax Rules, 1962. Once notified and approved by Parliament, the Income Tax Rules, 2026 will be applicable from the same date.The department had earlier released draft rules and forms as part of the transition to the new Income Tax Act, aimed at simplifying compliance and aligning procedural provisions with the updated law.Sources said revisions related to perquisites under the new framework will be applicable under both the old and the new tax regimes, offering relief across categories of taxpayers.The notification of the rules is seen as a key step in operationalising the Income Tax Act, 2025, ahead of its scheduled rollout from the next financial year starting April 1, 2026.The draft rules and forms will remain in the public domain for 15 days, until February 22, 2026. The Income Tax Department had invited stakeholders and members of the public to examine the draft framework and submit feedback, saying the consultative process is aimed at making the framing of subordinate legislation more participative and effective.According to the department, the drafting of the new Income-tax Rules and forms follows the same philosophy as the Income Tax Act, 2025, with a focus on simplification and clarity. The language of the rules has been simplified wherever possible, with formulas and tables introduced to improve understanding, while efforts have been made to eliminate redundancies present in the existing Income-tax Rules, 1961.While the broader policy framework has been retained, the department said selective changes have been introduced to align the rules and forms with provisions of the Income Tax Act, 2025.The tax forms included in the draft rules have also been significantly simplified to ease compliance for taxpayers. Common information has been standardised across forms to reduce duplication and lower the compliance burden.The department said the redesigned forms incorporate features such as automated reconciliation and pre-fill capabilities, making tax filing more intuitive and less prone to errors. It added that the use of smart forms would facilitate centralised processing and data-driven decision-making, enabling improved taxpayer services.Officials said the language used in the forms and accompanying notes has been simplified to avoid operational, administrative and legal ambiguity, further enhancing the overall taxpayer experience.","The Income Tax Department is likely to notify the draft Income Tax Rules, 2026 and the accompanying forms in the first week of March.

We are not going to regulate internal mechanism of EC: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said Monday it would under no circumstance allow stalling of special intensive revision (SIR) of voter rolls in 12 states but said it was open to suggestions to ensure genuine voters are not left out, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The CJI-led bench extended by a week the Feb 7 deadline for submission of documents by voters issued notice by EC, including 1.36 crore voters categorised under 'logical discrepancy'. It also sought a personal affidavit from the Bengal DGP on EC's charge of TMC functionaries making attempts to derail SIR. ""We hope the state remembers the laws of the land,"" it said.The bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria, which had heard West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee passionately argue for discontinuing SIR, frowned upon the state govt for not providing the names of 8,500 group B cadre officials to EC for assisting electoral revision officers (EROs) and assistant EROs in the massive document verification work. The displeasure had a dramatic effect as the West Bengal govt provided the list within minutes to EC in the court and said it would verify the suitability of the officials.The court also dismissed the fear expressed by Banerjee’s counsel Shyam Divan who told the bench that the process adopted by EC would lead to mass exclusion of voters given the fact that 50% of the cases of voters facing “logical discrepancy” scrutiny are misspelling of names, which happened due to translation errors.“This is a speculative apprehension,” the bench said, and allayed it by saying suitable officials, inducted by EC from among the 8,500 officers provided by the state govt, would assist the EROs and AEROs about the cases where notices have been issued merely because of spelling errors in names and facilitate their inclusion in voter lists.Though the Bengal govt, represented by a battery of senior advocates, vehemently argued against engagement of micro-observers drawn from central PSUs and the Union govt, the bench said the micro-observers along with the additional hands provided by the state govt would help the EROS and AEROs even though the the final decision on inclusion or deletion of voters from the final list would be taken by the EROs only.Since the Feb 7 deadline for document submission, its scrutiny and hearing period is extended by one week, the scheduled publication of the final voter list on Feb 14 is likely to be extended by one more week, that is to Feb 21.Advocate Kalyan Banerjee alleged that thousands of anonymous complaints against inclusion of names in voter lists have been filed and have been entertained by EC even as the rules and regulations mandate that person filing complaint must remain present during the hearing.The bench said, “We are not going to regulate the internal mechanism of EC in dealing with such issues.” Senior advocate V Giri, appearing for Sanatani Sangsad, alleged that there is widespread violence and open threats being given to EC officials to derail the SIR work.“Thousands of objections to names in voter lists were burnt,” Giri said and requested the bench to allow filing of fresh objections during the extended period for filing documents.For West Bengal, Menaka Guruswamy told the bench that the organisation is managing temples and wondered how a temple management organisation would have locus standi to file such an application.","The CJI-led bench extended by a week the Feb 7 deadline for submission of documents by voters issued notice by EC, including 1.36 crore voters categorised under 'logical discrepancy' It also sought a personal affidavit from the Bengal DGP on EC's charge of TMC functionaries making attempts to derail SIR.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128130773,imgsize-1215860,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The DAC’s task, one scientist said, was to analyse telemetry, ground station records, log books and process documents, and place them on a single timeline before any higher-level inquiry begins.To do this, another scientist said that the DAC has about around six minutes of flight information, recorded at intervals as fine as two milliseconds. He described this as a large amount of material that could reveal the health of the vehicle up to the moment of the anomaly.Isro has not indicated a timeline for the next PSLV launch — built by the HAL-L&T consortium — which was initially expected in the first quarter of this calendar year.Multiple sources confirmed that the mission has been put on hold until the analysis of the PSLV-C62 failure is complete.“The committee [DAC] is in the final leg of its analysis and once it completes the process, the FAC will be formally set up. This could happen very soon, in just a few days,” one source said. Unlike the DAC, which is being headed for a former Isro chairman and comprises internal teams, the FAC will comprise experts from outside the Department of Space (DoS) too.Aside from analysing the data from the PSLV-C62 mission to determine what exactly occurred during the mission, the DAC’s second priority, the scientist said, was to check for any link with the previous failure (PSLV-C61 from May 2025), followed by a complete review of the 33-year-old PSLV vehicle.“Having two repeated failures, it is essential to revisit the entire PSLV once again,” the scientist said. He added that the role of the DAC was to provide all the information that the FAC may require to carry out its analysis.“There will be data from telemetry, ground station, tracking data, other information about processes and tests, all of which need to be analysed and presented properly for the FAC to begin work,” the scientist said.While Isro has not formally said that the launches of other launch vehicles, the agency has been carrying out stringent reviews ahead of all planned missions. As reported by TOI last week, it is gearing up for a GSLV mission, while the planned SSLV mission is said to be put on hold given that its second stage is the same as the PSLV’s third stage (PS3).On Jan 12, after a normal lift-off and second stage performance, the PSLV-C62 suffered a glitch in PS3, which led to the failure. “...Close to the end of the third stage, we saw little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data and we shall come back at the earliest,” Narayanan had said soon after.","Isro is expected to formally constitute a Failure Analysis Committee (FAC) to investigate the causes for the mishap and recommend corrective measures soon.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said banks must devise an AI-based mechanism to flag all suspicious transaction from an account, issue alerts, and suspend the transfer until the transaction is authenticated with the account holder.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria said the home ministry has flagged the alarming siphoning of nearly Rs 52,000cr between April 2021 and Nov 2025 through online fraud, including ""digital arrest"". The bench said the banks' IT applications devised for seamless transactions cannot be only profit-oriented and must be equipped to detect unusual transactions and verify genuineness.The direction comes against the backdrop of growing number of instances where bank personnel failed to act despite unusually large withdrawls from accounts of senior citizens who had long banked with them.Attorney general (AG) R Venkataramani said RBI has devised an SOP for banks to thwart cyber frauds. The bench asked the ministry to examine the SOP and notify them for pan-India implementation. Justice Bagchi said, “In the over-anxiety of making profits, banks must realise they are trustees of public money.People have deposited their monies in banks because they trust them. These banks are becoming a huge liability to the public. ” The CJI said that the courts are becoming recovery agents for the banks, whose officials, in collusion with industrialists, grant huge loans recklessly and then use NCLAT and other tribunals to recover money.The attorney general said the home ministry has constituted a high-level inter-departmental committee to comprehensively examine all facets related to ‘digital arrest’. The committee will work under the chairmanship of special secretary in the ministry. The court asked RBI to discharge its duties as the regulator of banking sector to ensure security of hard-earned money of retired people. “The problem is banks are more into business mode, and naturally so, and in doing that, they are becoming, either innocently or connivingly, platforms through which there is a swift and seamless transmission of stolen proceeds of crime,” bench said.","Banks must devise an AI-based mechanism to flag all suspicious transaction from an account.

JAMMU: PDP slammed J&K’s Omar Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) govt on Monday for tapping the Centre’s Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI), calling it the “most dangerous scheme” after the abrogation of Article 370.The scheme provides 50-year interest-free loans for capital investments and infrastructure, besides offering financial incentives for reforms in key sectors.Speaking during the assembly’s budget session, PDP legislator Waheed Parra accused NC of betraying its mandate. “Why are you taking loans under this scheme? Who will repay these loans after 50 years?” Parra asked CM Omar, who was present in the House, in an emotional speech.Omar had in his budget speech last week revealed that J&K was brought under SASCI last year, saying his govt had “proactively leveraged this new opportunity”. “This reflects the confidence of Govt of India in reform orientation, financial discipline, and execution capacity of J&K,” Omar had said.However, Parra questioned SASCI’s benefits, pointing out that unlike the earlier MGNREGA rural job scheme, these funds are not a grant but a “market loan”.“If you are constructing roads, bridges and playgrounds under SASCI, you are effectively putting J&K under mortgage. You are putting J&K on sale. SASCI means destruction of J&K and you have brought it without consultation,” Parra argued, his voice getting louder and riling NC members.The Pulwama MLA urged Omar to allow a debate on the scheme. “It is a death trap. It (problems from similar loan schemes) happened in Bangladesh and Pakistan. We are selling J&K for petty loans. Who will repay this loan after 50 years, and who gives loans for free?” Parra asked.Parra went further with his criticism of the scheme. “BJP is not your alliance partner. So, on whose behest you are bringing this? Why are you taking a Rs 50,000-crore loan for free?” he asked.Later, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather ordered an inquiry into whether Parra had used an additional microphone to amplify his voice, which Omar and NC members claimed kept getting louder.","J&K's Omar Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) govt tapped Centre's Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) PDP legislator Waheed Parra accused NC of betraying its mandate.

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta on Monday said pollution control requires sustained, year-round action, inaugurating six new Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (CAAQMS) stations to expand real-time tracking of air quality across the capital.She also flagged off 100 'Vayu Rakshak' vehicles for stricter monitoring, and enforcement of pollution control norms.Addressing an event at the Delhi Secretariat, Gupta said the government is working towards comprehensive citywide monitoring and long-term policy action to address pollution at its source.""Our aim is to ensure that for every 25 sq km area in Delhi, there is at least one air quality monitoring station so that we get complete and accurate data on pollution levels and their sources,"" she said.The six new monitoring stations set up by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) are located at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Indira Gandhi National Open University, Netaji Subhas University of Technology West Campus (Dwarka), CWD Akshardham, Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Delhi Cantt and the Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Swimming Pool Complex at Talkatora Garden.Gupta said Delhi currently has 46 air quality monitoring stations, and 14 additional stations will be installed in the coming phase to ensure full coverage of residential areas, industrial zones, traffic corridors and green belts.""Pollution is not a seasonal problem. It requires 365-day caretaking, continuous monitoring and sustained action,"" she said, adding that air safety officers will be deployed for year-round supervision and enforcement.The chief minister asserted that the government is working on strengthening pollution control across sectors, including transport, roads, waste management and green cover. ""Clean air is a right, and we are committed to delivering it with seriousness and long-term planning,"" she said.Highlighting the works undertaken, she said city has the highest number of electric buses in the country, with 4,200 vehicles currently operational. ""By 2028, this number will increase to 14,000, which will significantly reduce vehicular emissions,"" she said.Gupta stressed that the pollution checking infrastructure is being upgraded, with automated vehicle testing stations being developed and a new electric vehicle policy for private vehicles under preparation.She described notification of large parts of the Delhi Ridge as forest land as a historic step. She said protecting green spaces is essential for improving Delhi's environmental health and ensuring long-term sustainability.Criticising previous approaches, Gupta said earlier governments treated pollution as a short-term issue. Referring to measures such as smoke towers and odd-even schemes, she said these were ""cosmetic solutions"" that failed to address pollution at its root.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who also addressed the event, outlined further steps being taken by the government to strengthen pollution control and enforcement.""To ensure strict monitoring, 100 'Vayu Rakshak' vehicles will be deployed across Delhi to check industrial, vehicular, hotel and institutional pollution,"" Sirsa said, adding that 100 permanent surveyors will also be appointed for year-round physical inspections.He said the government has strengthened coordination among the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), CAQM and the Centre, leading to systematic monitoring and data-based policy planning.Sirsa asserted that Delhi has also made progress in waste management, with around 85 per cent of the city's daily waste generation, around 12,500 metric tonnes, now being processed for energy production.Referring to legacy waste, he said the present government inherited three garbage dumps spread over 202 acres and about 60 metres high.""In just one year, garbage has been cleared from around 45 acres, and the height of the remaining dumps is being reduced,"" he said.He also alleged that previous governments failed to address the core causes of pollution and instead resorted to blame-shifting.""Everyone knows the reasons are road dust, vehicle emissions and garbage mountains but no serious work was done,"" Sirsa said.","Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta says pollution control requires sustained, year-round action.

Preserving Bastar’s culture and heritage

Centre confident of meeting March deadline

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said Maoism has never benefited any society and has only caused destruction wherever it existed, citing countries such as Colombia, Peru and Cambodia.He reiterated that the Naxal menace would be completely eliminated from India by March 31.Addressing the closing ceremony of the three-day division-level Bastar Pandum 2026 cultural festival in Jagdalpur, Shah urged Naxalites to surrender and return to the mainstream, assuring them of respectful rehabilitation, according to news agency PTI.He said the Chhattisgarh government’s Maoist rehabilitation policy was among the most attractive in the country and appealed especially for young tribal girls still involved in the movement to lay down arms. “They must be sent for rehabilitation as their whole lives lie ahead of them,” Shah said.The home minister made it clear that while surrendered Naxalites would face no harm, armed violence would be dealt with firmly. “If someone holds weapons, the response will also be with weapons. Maoism never benefitted any society and spread destruction wherever it existed, including nations like Colombia, Peru and Cambodia,” Shah said, adding that Maoists who plant IEDs or attack schools and hospitals will not be spared.He said such acts often harm innocent tribals and children, leaving them dead or permanently disabled, and questioned the cruelty behind such violence.Shah also blamed Maoists for shutting schools for decades, leading to widespread illiteracy in the region.Shah said Bastar is now witnessing rapid development, with schools reopening, roads being built, mobile towers installed and villages getting electricity and drinking water.“It is our resolve that Bastar will become the country’s most developed tribal-dominated division within the next five years,” he said.He outlined a roadmap covering seven districts of Bastar, aiming to provide electricity to all villages by December 2027, ensure mobile connectivity everywhere, and open a post office or bank branch within every five kilometres.Paddy will be procured from tribals at Rs 3,100 per quintal, LPG cylinders provided to households and tap water connections ensured in every home, he added.With Naxalism declining, Shah said the government is promoting new tourism initiatives such as adventure tourism, homestays, canopy walks and glass bridges to strengthen Bastar’s economy. He also announced a new 118-acre industrial area to generate jobs for tribal youth.On irrigation, Shah said projects on the Indravati river would irrigate 2.75 lakh hectares in Dantewada, Bijapur and Sukma districts and generate 120 MW of electricity.Stressing that guns and explosives cannot define Bastar’s identity, Shah said its true identity lies in its culture and heritage. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to take Bastar’s culture to the rest of the country and the world.Thanking security forces including the Chhattisgarh Police, CRPF, ITBP and BSF, Shah also expressed gratitude to the families of personnel who lost their lives in anti-Naxal operations.He said President Droupadi Murmu had inaugurated the Bastar Pandum event on February 7 and agreed to invite the top three winners in all 12 disciplines to Rashtrapati Bhavan to showcase their art and dine there.The festival has expanded significantly this year, with competitions across 12 disciplines involving participants from seven districts, 1,885 gram panchayats and 32 janpad headquarters, compared to seven disciplines last year.Yersterday, Shah had said the Centre’s strategy against Left-Wing Extremism was delivering results and that Naxalism would be eradicated before March 31.After a recent security review meeting in Raipur, he said a mix of security operations, infrastructure development, disruption of Maoist funding and an effective surrender policy had weakened the insurgency.According to police data, since January 2024 more than 500 Naxalites have been killed in encounters in Chhattisgarh, around 1,900 arrested and over 2,500 surrendered, reflecting the impact of sustained operations and rehabilitation efforts.","Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said Maoism has never benefited any society and has only caused destruction wherever it existed.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday informed the Supreme Court that detained climate activist Sonam Wangchuk is in “perfectly good” health and is receiving the “best possible treatment” from AIIMS, Jodhpur while in custody.Wangchuk has been lodged in a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, since September last year in connection with his alleged role in the deadly pro-statehood protests in his native Ladakh. He was detained under the National Security Act (NSA), a stringent law that permits preventive detention without formal charges or trial for up to 12 months.The Supreme Court is hearing a plea filed by Wangchuk’s wife, social entrepreneur Gitanjali Angmo, seeking a declaration that his detention is “illegal.”At the outset of the latest hearing, Justice Aravind Kumar, who is hearing the matter along with Justice PB Varale, asked Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the Union government, whether any progress had been made on the bench’s request to review the former educationist’s detention in light of his deteriorating health.""What happened? Any progress? Has it been done?"" Justice Kumar asked Nataraj.ASG Nataraj replied, ""I will submit... Nothing has been done as of now. He is getting the best of treatment.""A counsel appearing for Wangchuk submitted that it is “high time” to reconsider his detention, as the 59-year-old continues to remain unwell.""There are issues, and it's not like you are not denying it, and he is also making a complaint of health issues. The doctor says yes, it is there, and now treatment is being provided. Admittedly, the health issue is there, and on the last day itself we made the suggestion,"" Justice Varale told Nataraj.The ASG submitted, ""So far, the health issue is concerned, he is perfectly good… Jaipur is a better place to get treatment than Ladakh. There is AIIMS in Rajasthan, whereas in Ladakh, there would have been nothing.""The bench posted the plea for further hearing on Wednesday and made it clear that no further adjournments would be granted in the matter.This followed the Supreme Court’s observation on February 4 that Wangchuk’s health report was “not good,” prompting it to ask if the Centre would consider whether his detention could be reviewed in view of his medical condition.Earlier, appearing for Angmo, senior advocate Kapil Sibal had moved an application seeking a medical examination of Wangchuk by a specialist, citing his frequent complaints of stomach pain, possibly caused by contaminated water.Pursuant to the court’s directions, Wangchuk was examined by doctors at AIIMS Jodhpur, and a medical report was subsequently submitted to the Supreme Court.Wangchuk has rejected the allegations by the Union government and the Ladakh administration that he had called for the “overthrow” of the government, akin to movements such as the Arab Spring and recent youth-led protests in neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. He has asserted that he was merely exercising his “democratic right” to criticise and protest.","Wangchuk has been lodged in a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, since September last year.

The report cited Delhi police data showing that a total of 24,508 people were reported missing in Delhi during 2025.Of these, nearly 60% were women.While police managed to trace 15,421 individuals last year, as many as 9,087 cases remain unresolved, according to the figures.The data also point to a persistent trend involving teenagers. Reports indicate that more than 5,000 teenagers have been going missing in Delhi every year since 2016, including around 3,500 girls annually, underscoring concerns around the safety of minors and young women.The Commission said it has sought a comprehensive report from the Delhi government and city police on the steps taken to trace missing persons and the additional measures being implemented to address the rising numbers.","National human rights commission (NHRC) has taken suo motu cognisance of reports highlighting a sharp rise in missing persons cases in the national capital.

"'Absolute robbery': SC on siphoning of over Rs 54,000 crore in digital arrest cases; asks Centre to frame SoP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absolute-robbery-sc-on-siphoning-of-over-rs-54000-crore-in-digital-fraud-cases-asks-centre-to-frame-sop/articleshow/128110194.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday termed the siphoning of over Rs 54,000 crore through digital arrests as nothing short of “robbery or dacoity” and directed the Centre to formulate a standard operating procedure (SoP) to tackle such offences.A bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and NV Anjaria, noted that the money lost to digital fraud exceeds the annual budgets of several small states.“These offences may occur due to either collusion or negligence on the part of bank officials. This necessitates prompt action by the RBI and banks,” the bench observed, according to PTI.The top court pointed out that the Reserve Bank of India has already framed an SoP requiring banks to temporarily block debit cards to prevent cyber-enabled fraud. It directed the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to examine the RBI’s SoP, along with similar protocols or decisions taken by the Department of Telecom (DoT), and prepare a draft memorandum of understanding (MoU) within four weeks to effectively address such crimes.The bench also instructed the CBI to identify cases involving digital arrests and directed the Gujarat and Delhi governments to grant sanction to the agency to proceed with investigations in these matters.Further, the Supreme Court asked the RBI, DoT, and other stakeholders to hold a joint meeting and develop a framework for compensating victims of digital arrest scams. Emphasising the need for a “pragmatic and liberal approach” in awarding compensation, the court posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks and asked authorities to submit fresh status reports before the next date.Earlier, on December 16 last year, the bench had asked the Centre to consider suggestions made by the amicus curiae on ensuring compensation for victims, while expressing concern over the massive sums siphoned out of the country by cybercriminals. On December 1, it had directed the CBI to conduct a unified pan-India probe into digital arrest cases and questioned the RBI on why artificial intelligence was not being used to trace and freeze bank accounts linked to such crimes.Digital arrest is an emerging form of cybercrime in which fraudsters impersonate law-enforcement officials, court authorities, or government personnel to intimidate victims through audio or video calls, hold them virtually hostage, and coerce them into transferring money.",The money lost to digital fraud exceeds the annual budgets of several small states.

"Instead of foreign data, ICMR wants India’s own evidence to treat lifestyle diseases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/instead-of-foreign-data-icmr-wants-indias-own-evidence-to-treat-lifestyle-diseases/articleshow/128098205.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a shift aimed at making medical treatment more relevant to Indian patients, the Indian Council of Medical Research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate India-specific evidence for treating lifestyle and chronic diseases, instead of relying largely on data from Western countries.The move targets conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other non-communicable diseases that affect millions across the country. Health experts say therapies proven effective in Western populations do not always produce the same results in Indian patients because of differences in genetics, diet, climate, disease patterns and access to care.The need for such an approach is already evident in ongoing research. Dr Ambuj Rao, cardiologist at AIIMS Delhi, said India-specific clinical research is essential, pointing to a pan-India influenza vaccine trial in heart attack patients currently underway at AIIMS. He noted that evidence for such interventions cannot come from Western countries because India has a distinct flu season and different public health challenges.Under the initiative, networks of at least five hospitals will jointly evaluate treatments, medical procedures, digital tools and lifestyle interventions in real-world Indian settings.The aim is to identify therapies that are not only clinically effective but also affordable and workable within government hospitals and public health programmes. Officials said the findings will directly inform national treatment guidelines, with each selected study eligible for funding of up to Rs 8 crore over four years.Dr Ravinder Goswami from the endocrinology department at AIIMS Delhi said India’s tropical climate, repeated cycles of stress and poverty, and distinct dietary patterns have led to unique metabolic and hormonal adaptations in Indians, including insulin resistance, higher cortisol levels, central obesity and lower muscle mass. He said rapid lifestyle changes and the growing consumption of refined foods have worsened the burden of diabetes, hypertension, polycystic disorders and other metabolic diseases, which require culturally acceptable and India-specific treatment strategies. The ICMR’s call for well-planned studies, he added, offers a crucial opportunity to generate evidence for conditions unique to India, including certain metabolic disorders and cancers such as oral cancer.Beyond improving treatment protocols, the programme is also expected to strengthen India’s research capacity. Participating hospitals will be required to conduct trials independently, maintain standardised digital records and share data transparently, reducing dependence on pharmaceutical-driven global research.Public health experts say the initiative could have a direct impact on patients, as even small changes in treatment protocols, backed by Indian evidence, can improve outcomes and reduce out-of-pocket spending for families living with chronic disease. If successful, the effort could ensure that what doctors prescribe in India is guided by data generated from Indian patients, not assumptions imported from elsewhere.","The Indian Council of Medical Research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate India-specific evidence for treating lifestyle and chronic diseases.

The cancer we can see and still miss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-cancer-we-can-see-and-still-miss/articleshow/128098056.cms,".

It begins in plain sight — on the tongue, the cheek, the gums. Yet oral cancer, one of the few cancers that can be detected by a simple examination of the mouth, continues to be diagnosed far too late in India.Nearly 70 to 80 per cent of oral cancer patients in the country are identified only at advanced stages, when chances of survival drop sharply. While early-stage oral cancer has a five-year survival rate of over 80 per cent, late-stage disease pushes survival below 30 per cent. India today accounts for almost one-third of the world’s oral cancer burden, turning a largely preventable disease into a silent public health crisis.Doctors say the problem is delay. Patients typically take three to seven months from first noticing symptoms to reaching a specialised cancer centre. Early lesions are often painless, small, and easily ignored. A minor ulcer, a white patch, or slight discomfort while chewing is dismissed, especially among tobacco users, until the disease progresses beyond easy cure.“Oral cancer outcomes change dramatically with early screening,” says Dr Sultan A Pradhan, Surgical Oncologist at the Head &Neck Cancer Institute of India.Organised screening programmes, he says, can reduce mortality by 24 to 30 percent by detecting precancerous lesions early. Mobile screening units and community cancer camps have already shown that timely identification can stop cancer before it turns fatal.The risk factors are well known. More than 90 percent of oral cancer cases in India are linked to tobacco use, particularly smokeless forms such as gutka, khaini, and betel nut. Alcohol further increases the risk. Doctors are also reporting a gradual rise in HPV-related oral cancers among younger patients with no history of tobacco use, expanding the risk beyond traditional groups.Specialised hospitals play a crucial role once patients enter the system, combining early detection pathways with advanced surgery, reconstruction, and team-based care. But clinicians emphasise that even the best technology cannot fully offset the damage caused by late diagnosis. Oral cancer remains one of the few cancers where awareness and timely referral save more lives than any single drug or machine.At the same time, cancer care is moving beyond what scans can show. Dr Shrinidhi Nathany, Consultant Molecular Hematologist and Oncologist at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, explains that tumours smaller than five millimetres often escape detection on CT or PET scans. Blood-based tests that analyse circulating tumour DNA, or ctDNA, can detect biologically active disease, early relapse, and treatment resistance months before scans reveal any change.In the Indian context, where repeated imaging is expensive and often inaccessible, such tests could help reduce unnecessary scans and ineffective treatments. Used carefully, genomics may lower overall costs while enabling more precise, timely care.Oral cancer does not hide. It appears in the open. The tragedy is not that it cannot be seen, but that it so often is not looked at in time, said experts.","Nearly 70 to 80 per cent of oral cancer patients in the country are identified only at advanced stages, when chances of survival drop sharply.

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available.

Bond funds slide after RBI decision to keep rates unchanged,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/bond-funds-slide-after-rbi-decision-to-keep-rates-unchanged/articleshow/128105368.cms,"Bond funds slide (AI image)

What should investors do

(Disclaimer: Times of India does not give any personal finance or stock market investment advice. Always consult an expert before taking investment decisions)

The RBI’s latest policy decision to keep the repo rate unchanged has delivered an unpleasant surprise to the bond market. Traders and investors were positioned for an easing signal, but the central bank chose to stay put. Government bond yields shot up after the RBI decision was announced, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield climbing to 6.73%.Rising bond yields is bad news for debt fund investors. Bond prices and bond yields move in opposite directions. When yields rise, existing bonds with lower coupons become less attractive, so their prices fall, leading to an immediate drop in NAVs.The impact of the surge in bond yields was not uniform across categories. Mutual funds holding long-term bonds, especially gilt funds and long duration funds, were the worst hit. The long-duration category lost 0.75% and the gilt category fell 0.61% in a single day, wiping out gains of the past three months. Medium duration funds and dynamic bond funds also saw sharp losses of 29-35 basis points because they carry meaningful interest-rate sensitivity.Short-term funds, however, were relatively insulated. Their portfolios consist largely of bonds and money market instruments with very short maturities.Since these securities mature soon, they are less affected by changes in long-term yields. In simple terms, their NAVs don’t swing as wildly when the market re-prices interest rates. The category slipped 14 basis points on Friday.Market experts now believe that India’s rate-cutting cycle is over. Instead of a quick easing phase, the more likely scenario is a prolonged pause. “We expect the curve to steepen incrementally and yields to gradually rise on the back of higher gross borrowings in the current fiscal,"" says Puneet Pal, Head of Fixed Income at PGIM India Mutual Fund.Others also expect the pain to continue. “The bearishness in the bond market, driven by a mix of structural, cyclical, and one-off factors, is likely to persist through the rest of 2026-27, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield hovering in the 6.60–6.75% range,” says Madhavi Arora, Chief Economist, Emkay Global Financial Services.If your debt fund portfolio is tilted towards long duration, gilt or aggressive dynamic bond funds, it may be time to reassess. These categories work best when interest rates are falling, because bond prices rise sharply and funds benefit from capital gains. But when yields rise, even gradually, these funds can deliver negative returns for weeks or months, and the volatility can be unsettling for investors who entered expecting “fixed-income-like” stability.If your goal is parking money for 6 months to 3 years, avoid long duration exposure. Instead, the safer approach in the current cycle is to stay with short-term debt funds and focus on accrual. Short duration funds, money market funds, and high-quality corporate bond funds with low maturity profiles tend to generate returns largely through interest income rather than bond price gains. This accrual strategy is typically steadier, and it reduces the risk of sudden NAV shocks when yields spike.Long-term debt funds are not “bad”, but they require the right timing and the ability to tolerate volatility. Right now, with the market shifting from rate-cut hopes to a higher-yield reality, most retail investors are better off staying short, earning accrual, and letting the interest-rate noise pass.","The impact of the surge in bond yields was not uniform across categories.

IT stocks crash! Rs 2.5 lakh crore erased in 3 Days — What should investors do?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-stock-crash-rs-2-5-lakh-crore-erased-in-3-days-what-should-investors-do/articleshow/128106035.cms,"Anthropic unveiled new automation tools

Palantir's announcement that its AI platform can now complete SAP migrations in weeks rather than the years traditionally required.

What's the outlook?



IT stock investors are struggling with sharp losses as the sector is going through a phase of massive sell offs. In the past three trading sessions, Nifty IT index has plunged almost 8%, erroding almost Rs 2.5 lakh crore from the market value. Traders are also concerned about concerns over AI automation, that could majorly disrupt the traditional outsourcing model.The recent market turbulence arose from two key developments:The latter claim rattled investors, as ERP implementation was previously considered largely immune to AI disruption. Motilal Oswal’s Abhishek Pathak offered a stark assessment of the potential impact. “Assuming a 30–50% productivity hit on low-level work in these areas, we believe 9–12% of IT services revenue stands to be eliminated. We expect this to happen over three to four years, underscoring a ~2% hit on revenue growth each year,” he told ET. He noted that before Palantir’s comments, 30–40% of IT services revenues were already thought to be at risk from AI deflation, particularly in application development, maintenance, and testing.Pathak warned that the scope of AI’s disruption could expand. “If ERP migration and third-party enterprise software, which accounts for 10–15% of industry revenues, come under the purview of AI, the hit from AI would be higher,” he said.The selloff intensified after Palantir’s earnings call highlighted AI’s potential in areas that were once considered safe haven. “The key catalyst was the Palantir earnings call, which highlighted how the company is upending pay-per-seat software such as Workday and ServiceNow, as well as third-party software with its own AI offerings,” Pathak said.Additional factors weighed on sentiment. “Anthropic’s entry into automating low-level legal services work and Gartner’s muted guidance also had a bearing on sentiment,” Pathak added. “While AI’s threat to software coding hours was well known, Palantir’s comments put ERP implementation into the spotlight, which so far was considered less impacted by AI’s productivity gains.”Historical experience suggests that such disruption, while challenging, can ultimately benefit the industry. “AI will render much of legacy software and testing redundant. Just like hyperscalers were initially a significant headwind to infrastructure management services, and BPO got disrupted in an earlier cycle in 2015,” Pathak noted. “Many legacy IMS and BPO roles do not exist anymore, but cloud migration over a five-year period proved accretive for the industry. ”He added that the transition period can be bumpy. “During the early cloud build-out phase in 2016–17, hyperscaler capex expansion initially acted as a revenue headwind for Indian IT services as enterprises paused traditional outsourcing in favour of direct cloud investments. Once the capex cycle normalised, industry growth re-accelerated sharply.”Some analysts, however, see a more positive outlook for IT services compared with software firms. BofA Securities’ Amish Shah explained, “We think that the plug-ins being released by AI companies matter more for the software companies and do not change much for the IT services companies. The broader developments around AI’s use in business have been moving more constructively over the past few months. Companies have been highlighting the increasing opportunity available for them as more AI pilots go into an implementation phase and that their partnership with AI-first companies is driving up demand for enterprise-grade AI solutions. ”Shah also acknowledged emerging concerns. “There has been associated news flow that claims AI tools are helping finish SAP migration in a few weeks versus taking a few years earlier. This has become a new topic of discussion around deflation risk levels in the IT services sector.”From a technical standpoint, the Nifty IT index is at a crucial level, holding 35,400 on a closing basis. “However, a breakdown below this level could potentially create mayhem in the sector,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. “On the other hand, if the index sustains above 35,400, we can expect a meaningful price recovery in the IT space.”With large-cap IT stocks trading at around 20 times one-year forward earnings, slightly below their 10-year average, Shah recommended caution. “We would continue to maintain a selective stance on the sector and prefer only those companies where visibility of acceleration in growth in FY27 is high, backed by their ability to participate in AI services spends and where there is a proactive and concerted push towards an AI-led operating model,” he told ET.Unmesh Sharma of HDFC Securities offered a balanced view, “We have a neutral position on Indian IT companies in our model portfolio and we continue to hold that."" The expert added that although India may not lead in AI innovation, Indian companies are expected to play a significant role in implementing AI solutions across the corporate sector.","In the past three trading sessions, Nifty IT index has plunged almost 8%, erroding almost Rs 2.5 lakh crore from the market value.

Gold, Silver Prices Today: Top 10 Things To Know

In global commodity markets, gold prices were around the $5,000-an-ounce mark. Prices climbed up to 1.7% on Monday, recovering nearly half of the losses incurred after retreating sharply from the record high recorded on January 29. Silver continued to display greater volatility, with price movements intensified by speculative activity and relatively limited over-the-counter trading volumes. After dropping by more than one-third from its peak level, the metal gained as much as 5% on Monday, moving back above $80 per ounce. According to Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart, gold is likely to maintain support near $4,555 per troy ounce on a closing basis, while silver could hold above $65 per troy ounce. On the MCX, he estimates gold support at Rs 1,54,000–Rs 1,51,800 and resistance at Rs 1,57,700–Rs 1,60,000. Jain advises accumulating gold within the 154,000–152,000 band, keeping a stop loss below 150,500, with upside targets of 156,800–159,000. For silver, he suggests buying in the 250,000–244,000 range, placing a stop loss below 236,600, and aiming for targets of 2,55,500–2,62,000 and 2,65,500. Market analysts are of the view that the recent sharp surge in silver prices was not primarily driven by industrial demand. Instead, it was largely fuelled by speculative buying, as investors rushed in amid fears of missing further gains. A report by Mirae Asset Mutual Fund noted that while the rally initially rested on familiar and previously credible themes, silver eventually moved well beyond its underlying fundamentals. For years, silver has remained in gold’s shadow, with gold continuing to dominate as the preferred safe-haven during periods of geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over weakening fiat currencies. Both investors and central banks largely favoured gold during such phases. According to Chirag Mehta, CIO at Quantum AMC, the decline in the US dollar and growing doubts surrounding its long-term reserve currency role have been key factors supporting gold’s ongoing rally. Why did gold, silver prices crash in the last few days? The steep rally in recent months encouraged investors to book profits in both metals, adding to the downward pressure on prices. Multiple factors have been linked to the recent sharp correction seen in both gold and silver. The immediate trigger was US President Donald Trump’s backing of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his preferred choice to replace current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Markets view Warsh as a policy hawk inclined toward stricter control over inflation and tighter monetary policy. The dollar strengthened against major global currencies, reducing the appeal of such assets and weakening the dollar-debasement narrative.

What Fragrances Will Define Ramadan 2026 for Women? Exploring Arabic Perfume Trends

Why Arabic perfume culture is resonating with women ahead of Ramadan 2026







As the holy month of Ramadan gears up to unfold across the Middle East and beyond, women’s fragrance choices are becoming a meaningful expression of personal style, cultural resonance and sensory storytelling. Arabic perfumes, long celebrated for their rich, evocative compositions, are trending this season not just as gifts or evening scents but as symbolic extensions of the Ramadan experience: warm, comforting and deeply memorable.In 2026, the narrative around women’s fragrances reflects broader industry shifts toward textural sophistication and emotional connection. Global perfumery trends emphasise personalisation, immersive scent experiences and nuanced reinterpretations of classic notes, all of which align beautifully with the rich palette of Arabic perfumery.One of the defining movements in the Ramadan perfume landscape this year is the resurgence of floral-oriental compositions. These perfumes blend soft blossoms like jasmine and rose with deeper bases such as amber and musk, resulting in scents that feel both romantic and sophisticated. For many women, these fragrances strike the perfect balance between everyday elegance and evening allure, suitable for mosque visits, iftar gatherings or Eid celebrations.Floral-oriental profiles are evolving in 2026 to feel more refined and textured. Industry voices note that florals are being paired with unexpected elements of earthier woods, nuanced resins or gourmand undertones, giving traditional blooms a modern and personal expression.As the sun sets and social rhythms begin, many women are drawn toward warm spice and amber compositions. These fragrances open with rich, comforting top notes, often complemented by subtle hints of spice, before settling into amber-clad bases that envelop the wearer in warmth. These profiles are especially beloved for evening wear, when gatherings with loved ones call for something both bold and memorable.In a broader context, amber and spice-driven perfumes resonate with a growing preference for scents that feel like a sensory hug: enveloping, rich and long-lasting. This mirrors global trends where gourmands and amber accords are gaining traction for their comforting, tactile qualities.Another strong current in the Ramadan fragrance story for women is the rise of softly sweet and powdery scents. These are lighter, more approachable compositions featuring gentle sweetness or subtle vanilla-like nuances layered with musky or floral undertones.They are excellent for daytime moments of quiet reflection, casual outings or workplaces where subtlety and elegance are valued over bold projection. This trend toward nuanced sweetness also reflects a shift in the industry where refined gourmand notes feel less dessert-sweet and more textured, mature and wearable.More women are also embracing the idea of scent layering by combining multiple fragrances or formats (like concentrated oils, sprays or body mists) to create something uniquely personal. This approach echoes a broader 2026 trend toward “scent wardrobes” or narrative fragrance experiences, where a perfume isn’t just a single choice but part of a richer sensory identity.Layering allows for playful contrasts like a soft floral with a warm amber base or a light citrus top with a spice-accented dry-down, offering versatility throughout the varied moments of Ramadan and Eid.Arabic perfumes for women this Ramadan are not just trending because of their notes; they are resonating because they bridge tradition and contemporary expression. Their richness and depth reflect cultural heritage, while their evolving compositions align with global fragrance innovations, from gumptious amber blends to nuanced floral artistry.Whether worn for spiritual reflection, family gatherings or festive evenings, these fragrances are helping redefine how scent plays into holiday rituals, turning each application into a small celebration of identity, memory and beauty.","Ramadan 2026 Fragrance Trends: Arabic Perfumes for Women, Floral-Oriental and Amber Scents.

GCC's Digital Gold Rush: Are You Skilled Enough for 2026's Tech Takeover?

Soft skills: Leadership, communication and adaptability



Lifelong learning and reskilling mindset



Understanding localisation policies







As GCC economies accelerate towards digital-first, knowledge-driven growth, the skills that employers are looking for in 2026 have shifted dramatically. From Saudi Arabia ’s Vision 2030 projects to the UAE’s AI-led governance push, hiring priorities across the Gulf are increasingly shaped by technology adoption, sustainability goals and workforce localisation policies.Artificial Intelligence sits at the heart of GCC transformation strategies. According to the Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 , digital and AI-driven roles are among the hardest to fill across the Middle East , with 90% of employers reporting skills shortages, particularly in advanced tech roles.Academic research supports this shift. A 2024 study published on arXiv , analysing millions of job listings, found that AI adoption increases demand not just for AI engineers but for AI-literate professionals across non-technical roles as well. The paper noted, “AI exposure is associated with higher demand for complementary skills such as analytical thinking, adaptability and collaboration.”In the GCC, AI skills are increasingly required in finance, healthcare, government services, logistics and media, not just tech firms.Data has become the backbone of decision-making in Gulf organisations. A landmark 2017 Strategy and PwC report on the GCC digital workforce found that while digital adoption is growing, advanced data skills remain scarce, limiting productivity gains.The report stated, “The shortage of advanced analytics and data science skills is one of the biggest barriers preventing GCC organisations from capturing full value from digital investments.” As governments and enterprises push for smart cities, fintech ecosystems and AI-powered public services, professionals skilled in data analysis, business intelligence and statistical modelling are becoming indispensable.With rapid digitisation comes increased cyber risk. While GCC-specific academic studies are limited, global labour research consistently ranks cybersecurity among the fastest-growing skills worldwide, a trend echoed in GCC hiring data.According to hiring outlooks cited by Khaleej Times and regional recruitment firms, cybersecurity specialists remain in high demand as governments and private firms strengthen digital infrastructureThese skills are especially relevant in banking, government, aviation and healthcare sectors across the GCC.Cloud expertise is now a foundational requirement rather than a niche skill. As per global hiring outlook reports AI, cloud and platform engineering roles dominate new job creation in global capability centres expanding operations linked to GCC markets.Cloud architects, DevOps engineers and platform specialists are especially valuable as Gulf companies migrate operations to scalable digital ecosystems.Despite the digital pivot, engineering and project management remain pillars of GCC employment, driven by infrastructure, energy and urban development megaprojects. According to regional hiring analyses cited by Khaleej Times, demand continues for professionals who can manage large-scale, multi-stakeholder projects, particularly those integrating digital and sustainability elementsProject managers with technical literacy, risk management skills and cross-cultural leadership ability are especially prized.Sustainability is no longer optional in the GCC. With the UAE and Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy, clean technology and climate initiatives, green skills are moving into the mainstream.A recent 2025 workforce analysis by PeopleConnect Global highlights rising demand for professionals skilled in sustainability reporting, renewable energy systems and environmental compliance across GCC markets.Roles linked to net-zero strategies, ESG compliance and sustainable infrastructure are expected to grow steadily through 2026.Multiple studies stress that human skills grow more valuable as automation increases. The same arXiv 2024 study on AI and labour markets found that AI-exposed roles show higher demand for teamwork, communication and resilience, not less.In the GCC, where teams are highly multicultural, employers increasingly value professionals who can lead diverse teams, communicate clearly and adapt to fast-changing environments.The 2027 Strategy& GCC digital workforce report emphasises that long-term employability depends not on one-time qualifications but on continuous upskilling. The report noted that economies that embed lifelong learning frameworks will be better positioned to meet future labour demands.This message is echoed in national workforce strategies across the Gulf.Understanding Emiratisation, Saudisation and national talent development policies is increasingly important. The Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 highlights that localisation efforts are reshaping hiring strategies, particularly in leadership and specialist roles. Professionals who align their skills with these frameworks gain a competitive edge.Research across academia, recruitment and policy consistently point to one conclusion that GCC jobs in 2026 will reward hybrid professionals or those who combine digital fluency, analytical capability, adaptability and human-centric skills. From AI literacy to sustainability expertise, the most future-proof careers will belong to individuals who learn continuously, adapt quickly and align with the region’s transformation goals.","Hiring priorities across the Gulf are increasingly shaped by technology adoption, sustainability goals and workforce localisation policies.

How much are overstay fines in the UAE?



Visitor or tourist visa holders begin accruing AED 50 per day from the day after their visa expires.

Residents also pay AED 50 per day after a 30-day grace period, which applies following visa cancellation.

Additional administrative and service fees such as exit and e-service charges may also apply when finalising overstay penalties.

Unlike in years past, most tourist and visit visas no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses.

no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses. For residents whose visas have been formally cancelled (e.g., due to job changes), the UAE provides a 30-day grace period before fines begin, during which the holder must either exit the country or adjust their status.

Consequences of unpaid fines in the UAE



Travel bans that prevent departure until fines are paid.

Blocked future visa applications until outstanding penalties are cleared.

Accumulating daily charges that significantly raise the total cost the longer the overstay continues.

Where and how to pay overstay fines

If status changes occur (e.g., job shifts for residents), ensure cancellation or renewal processes are initiated timely.





As millions of travellers and expatriates continue to live, work and visit the UAE, authorities have standardised visa overstay penalties and streamlined payment options, making compliance clearer but also more urgent than ever. Under the latest immigration framework, overstaying your visa in the UAE now carries a unified daily fine across most visa types, with simple online and in-person payment options for residents and visitors alike.If you stay in the UAE beyond the validity of your visa, you are likely to face fines. In recent years, UAE immigration authorities have standardised the penalty system and made it easier to check and pay overstay fines online or in person. Here’s what you need to know to stay compliant and avoid extra costs.Recent regulatory updates have consolidated the overstay penalty system where visitors, tourists and residents who remain beyond their permitted stay now face a daily fine of AED 50 ($13.6) per day. This flat rate applies regardless of visa category and replaces older systems that once charged different amounts for different visa types. In other words, this unified rate replaces older systems where resident overstays sometimes carried different charges, making the fines easier to calculate.Under the standardised structure:Extended overstays can lead to more than just daily charges. In some cases authorities may impose exit bans, preventing travellers from leaving the country until penalties are cleared. Failure to settle fines can also complicate future UAE visa applications and travel plans.Failing to settle overstay fines can lead to additional issues, including:Further, immigration law enforcement may escalate legal action against repeat or prolonged violators, including possible deportation or temporary travel restrictions, depending on individual circumstances.UAE authorities have made it relatively easy to check and settle overstay fines through multiple official channels:Authorities advise ensuring all accumulated fines are paid before attempting to exit the UAE, as unresolved penalties may block departure until they are cleared.To sidestep fines altogether:Understanding the current overstay fine system is vital for anyone living in or visiting the UAE. With penalties now uniform and payment methods widely accessible, staying compliant is not just a legal obligation; it can also save visitors and expats significant costs and complications at the airport or immigration checkpoints.Visa overstay fines in the UAE, currently AED 50 per day for most visa types, can add up quickly, especially if there is no grace period for your visa category. The authorities now provide online tools to check and pay fines, making it easier to comply and avoid travel bans or blocks on future visas. Planning ahead, tracking expiry dates and using official portals or service centres will help you avoid unnecessary penalties.","Visitor or tourist visa holders begin accruing AED 50 per day from the day after their visa expires.

At the interbank forex market, the currency at was at 90.63 levels against the greenback.

KOCHI: Kerala high court on Monday granted permission to the special investigation team (SIT) probing the alleged gold heist at Sabarimala temple to collect samples again from the gold-clad doors of the sreekovil and plates stored on the temple premises for a deep metallurgical examination to assess the quantity of gold lost.A bench of Justices V Raja Vijayaraghavan and K V Jayakumar passed the order permitting the SIT to collect samples from the Sannidhanam under controlled and documented conditions, on Feb 12. HC was considering a request by ADGP law and order and crimes H Venkatesh, who heads the SIT, seeking permission to conduct advanced metallurgical examinations, including X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF) to determine surface elemental composition, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for ultra-trace impurity and elemental profiling, and Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) to analyse alloy composition and metallurgical uniformity.It was submitted that none of the forensic laboratories in Kerala, including the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, are equipped to conduct these tests and that specialised institutions such as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, the National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur and the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory, Hyderabad, would be required to undertake the examination.Considering the request, HC noted that earlier SIT reports indicated that the original gold cladding had been removed and replaced with fresh surface plating of lesser thickness.The SIT now seeks advanced scientific analysis to establish, with precision and objectivity, the extent of material alteration, the nature of metallurgical manipulation, and the quantum of gold originally present and subsequently depleted. Allowing the request, HC adjourned the matter to Feb 19 for the SIT to report whether adequate samples had been collected and to furnish details of the institution where the tests would be conducted.During the hearing on Monday, Venkatesh and S Sasidharan, the investigating officer, submitted that statements of 262 witnesses had been recorded. It was further submitted that, in the case relating to the alleged misappropriation of gold cladding from the copper plates of the dwarapalaka idols, the role of the remaining four accused had been verified and the involvement of two accused had been confirmed. Similarly, in the second case relating to the alleged theft of gold from other sacred temple valuables, the role of the remaining two accused had been verified and the involvement of one accused had been confirmed.

A car and poisoned trail: Inside Delhi’s triple death puzzle; families reject suicide theory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/a-car-a-poisoned-trail-inside-delhis-triple-death-puzzle/articleshow/128125869.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The investigation into the deaths of three people including a woman, found in a car near Peeragarhi flyover in west Delhi on Sunday, aims to explore if it could be a case of homicide or ‘murder-suicide' after the families of the two men squarely rejected the initial suspicion that they may have died by suicide.According to sources, a line of probe is to verify if one of the deceased individuals — Randhir (78), Shiv Naresh (47) and Laxmi (40) — was being blackmailed or extorted.The possibility of a fourth person in the car — given the passenger seat was vacant — is also being verified through CCTV footage. While the post-mortem reports are awaited, police are analysing the bank statements and call logs to ascertain if any financial disputes preceded the tragedy. The deceased were private lenders or financers too, so the list of debtors is also being checked.Spot probe revealed that the car doors were locked and no external injuries were visible. The forensics team, upon breaking into the vehicle, was met with the pungent odour of what is suspected to be a poisonous substance. A soft drink bottle found near the seats along with plastic glasses has been seized, with experts checking if it served as the delivery mechanism for a lethal cocktail.A helmet and a tracksuit belonging to Shiv Naresh were found on the back seat along with a gamchha (towel). The woman's jewellery, cash in Randhir's pocket, and the mobile phones of Shiv and Laxmi were found intact, but Randhir's phone was missing, the family said.The families of Randhir and Shiv said they were neither depressed nor was there any pressing financial crisis brewing. The two were partners in the real estate business for more than six years. Laxmi, a resident of Jahangirpuri, was known to Shiv, said police.On Sunday morning, Shiv arrived at Randhir's home on his motorcycle and parked it there. The two then left together around 10am in Randhir's car, with Randhir driving and Shiv in the passenger seat. Laxmi was not with them at the time, Randhir's family said.Randhir used to be a DTC bus driver who opted for voluntary retirement about 20 years ago after his son died of cancer. He later established himself as a property dealer. He was living in Baprola with his wife, daughter-in-law and grandchild. His four daughters are married and living with their spouses.""He was a happy, wealthy man. He left home with Shiv in the morning like any other day. He greeted me around 9.30am as usual near his house,"" said Mohit, Randhir's nephew. ""He was earning Rs 15-16 lakh a month from rental income. He also owned land near Chanchal Park that he had leased to a petrol pump. Our family was looking forward to the inauguration ceremony on March 25 for a property with a ground-plus-three structure, valued at about Rs 5 crore. He used to donate Rs 1 lakh or more at a time to a cow shelter,"" Randhir's brother, also named Naresh (68), told TOI.Shiv's son Atul (20) said he and his brother were currently studying while their mother, a homemaker, stays in Etah, UP.

But I've directed BMRCL to recalculate and come up with a revised fare. It may come down or may not after recalculation,"" he added.Responding to claims that Metro fares were higher in Bengaluru than in any other city, Shivakumar said comparisons with Delhi should factor in security and taxation differences. ""In Delhi, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) handles security and Goods and Services Tax is not paid. In Bengaluru, BMRCL bears significant security costs,"" he said.He also said BJP leaders had demanded a fare hike until the next board meeting, but the meeting scheduled for Monday was postponed without any decision. ""The board meeting was called off after the Union govt realised it could not intervene without constituting a new FFC,"" he said.Responding to BJP's claims taking credit for the stay on fare hike, Shivakumar said, ""I'm not seeking credit. The Centre has no role or power in this. It is a decision of the state govt, and we are committed to taking decisions in the interest of the people."" He also alleged that the BJP and some MPs were politicising the issue.He added that the state govt had provided Rs 1,064 crore to compensate for cash losses and paid Rs 4,002 crore to the Centre towards loan repayment.However, in Davanagere, chief minister Siddaramaiah appeared to contradict Shivakumar, saying the state govt had no role in determining Metro fares and the decision rested with the Metro chairman appointed by the Centre.On Monday, Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya arrived at RV Road Metro station carrying an empty trunk bearing a sticker that read: ""Congress Sarkara, Khali Trunk Sarkara."" It also had on it images of the CM and DCM.Taking a dig at the state govt, Surya alleged that the fare hike followed a communication from state officials to the FFC stating that an increase was necessary to reduce the financial burden on the govt.Accusing the state of splurging public money on guarantee schemes, he claimed that this had led to the withdrawal of ""shadow financial support"" to BMRCL. This, he alleged, forced the Metro operator to seek a steep fare hike through the FFC to offset losses.Police stopped Surya, Jayanagar MLA CK Ramamurthy, and others from entering the Metro station. They were detained briefly before being released. Surya reiterated that the Namma Metro fare revision was put on hold only after Union housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar intervened.A board meeting of BMRCL, scheduled for Monday, was cancelled following instructions from the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA). On Sunday, BMRCL announced that the proposed annual fare revision of 5%, scheduled to take effect from Monday, was put on hold until further orders. It also said a decision on revised fares would be communicated after a board review.Sources said the board meeting was indeed scheduled for Monday, but a communication from the Union govt led to its cancellation. ""The reason for cancelling the meeting is not known, and it is unclear when the next meeting will be held,"" a source said.The BMRCL board is chaired by the secretary of MoHUA and includes representatives from both the Union and state govts.","BJP MP Tejasvi Surya arrived at RV Road Metro station carrying an empty trunk bearing a sticker that read: ""Congress Sarkara, Khali Trunk Sarkara"" It also had on it images of the CM and DCM.
