10 facts about Nipah Virus

NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry on Tuesday clarified that the Nipah virus situation in West Bengal is under control, with only two confirmed cases reported since December last year, even as Thailand and Nepal tightened health screening of passengers arriving from India as a precautionary measure.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said reports from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) show no additional Nipah Virus Disease cases beyond the two confirmed infections.Despite the limited case count, neighbouring countries have moved to heighten vigilance. Thailand has begun screening passengers at three international airports receiving flights from West Bengal, while Nepal has initiated checks at Kathmandu airport and major land border points with India.Nipah virus is a rare but highly fatal zoonotic infection that spreads from animals to humans and through close human contact. Naturally harboured by fruit bats (flying foxes), the virus can cause symptoms ranging from fever and respiratory illness to acute encephalitis, with a case fatality rate of 40–75%. There is no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine, making early detection and strict infection control critical.The World Health Organization classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen due to its epidemic potential.Following confirmation of the two cases, the Centre, in coordination with the West Bengal government, activated comprehensive containment measures, including enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing and field investigations by central and state health teams.The ministry said 196 contacts linked to the cases were identified, traced, monitored and tested, with all found asymptomatic and negative. “These measures ensured timely containment, and no further spread has been detected,” it said.Health officials stressed that the screening measures adopted by Thailand and Nepal are precautionary, reflecting global sensitivity to Nipah’s high fatality rate rather than any escalation in India.“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health safeguards are in place,” the ministry said, urging the public and media to rely only on verified official information and avoid speculative reports.With no fresh cases detected and all contacts testing negative, authorities maintain that India’s response has been swift and effective, even as neighbouring countries err on the side of caution to prevent cross-border risk.",Nipah virus is a rare but highly fatal zoonotic infection that spreads from animals to humans.

First for India: Startup edges closer to launch of its inflatable Space habitat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-for-india-startup-edges-closer-to-launch-of-its-inflatable-space-habitat/articleshow/127669003.cms,"BENGALURU: A Bengaluru-based startup has moved a step closer towards launching an inflatable space habitat, a first for India, by completing key tests in Switzerland, enabled through its partners, including the European Space Agency (Esa).Akashlabdhi, a startup incubated at IISc, is now planning to launch a scaled-down version of the inflatable habitat, “AntarikshHAB”, designed for future human missions, in July. Conventional space habitats, like the International Space Station (ISS), have long grappled with issues of scalability, cost-efficiency, and limited living space.“Unlike what was done with ISS, or what is being planned for future space stations, AntarikshHAB can be launched as a compact habitat which will later inflate in space. In July, we will be launching a habitat that will be 70 cubic metres while the final habitat we are planning to develop will be around 300 cubic meters,” Akashlabdhi CEO Siddarth Jena told TOI.The July mission, to be launched aboard a vehicle provided by Spanish firm PLD Space, is designed as more than a brief technology demonstration. In addition to deploying the inflatable module in orbit, the plan includes a controlled de-orbit and atmospheric re-entry.“Post-flight inspection of recovered material is expected to yield data on degradation, survivability and end-of-life behaviour, areas that are increasingly important as regulators and space agencies stress responsible operations in low Earth orbit,” Jena said.For its programme, Akashlabdhi has collaborated with multiple European organisations, including Versuchsstollen Hagerbach (VSH) and the Amberg Group. “The programme is supported through grants and institutional participation from Esa and its partners, enabling the establishment of a dedicated Human Habitat Safety and Research & Development facility at VSH Hagerbach in Switzerland,” Jena said.The underground lab, operated by Amberg Group, provides a controlled environment with substantial natural rock overburden, allowing for realistic studies of radiation attenuation, structural integrity, isolation effects, and long-duration habitat performance under conditions that are difficult to replicate using surface-based facilities.“To advance our system to Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6), a comprehensive test campaign was conducted. This included pressure and leak-before-burst tests on multi-layer flexible structures, thermal cycling and accelerated ageing of materials, and impact testing to simulate micrometeoroid and orbital debris strikes. Repeated deployment trials have also been carried out to assess the reliability of restraint and inflation mechanisms,” Jena said.These activities are supported by an integrated sensor network feeding into a digital twin framework, enabling real-time correlation between measured performance and predictive safety models.“Academic and research participation forms a core pillar of the collaboration. On the Indian side, IISc, IIT-Roorkee, and IIT-Delhi are contributing expertise in space structures, materials, systems engineering, and human-centric design. Swiss participation includes ETH Zurich, EMPA, and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), working alongside Esa-linked research activities to support materials science, radiation studies, and advanced validation methodologies,” Jena said.Akashalabdhi leads overall habitat architecture, systems engineering and mission design, while the Amberg Group brings decades of experience in underground safety engineering and certification-oriented testing. The partnership, both sides say, is an attempt to apply proven terrestrial safety principles to the emerging domain of orbital infrastructure.Felix Amberg, president of the board of Amberg Group, said: “The collaboration is an extension of established civil and underground engineering principles into the domain of space systems, highlighting the value of combining underground safety validation with orbital deployment and recovery.”Beyond the immediate technical goals, the project is also being seen as a marker of closer cooperation between India and Switzerland, and more broadly with EFTA nations, in high-technology research.","A Bengaluru-based startup has moved a step closer towards launching an inflatable space habitat, a first for India.

Why unions are striking

Government banks step in to limit disruption

Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as bank unions go ahead with a nationwide strike to press for the immediate implementation of a five-day work week.The strike has been called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions representing bank officers and employees, after conciliation meetings with the chief labour commissioner on January 22 and 23 failed to yield any assurance on their demand, union leaders said.With banks already closed on January 23 (Basant Panchami), January 24 (fourth Saturday), January 25 (Sunday) and January 26 (Republic Day), the strike on January 27 is expected to disrupt branch-level services for five consecutive days.“Despite detailed discussions during the conciliation proceedings, there was no assurance on our demand. Hence, we have been compelled to proceed with the strike action,” C H Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), a UFBU constituent, told PTI.Branch-level services such as cash deposits, withdrawals, cheque clearances and administrative work are expected to be hit at public sector lenders, including State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda.However, operations at major private sector banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are expected to remain largely unaffected, as their employees are not part of the unions participating in the strike.Digital banking services, including UPI, mobile and internet banking, will continue to function, though ATM cash availability could face localised issues due to logistical delays.The unions are demanding that all Saturdays be declared holidays, a proposal they say was agreed upon during the 12th Bipartite Settlement signed with the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in March 2024 but is yet to be notified by the government.“It is unfortunate that the government is not responding to our genuine demand. There would be no loss of man-hours as we have agreed to work an extra 40 minutes daily from Monday to Friday,” Rupam Roy, general secretary of the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), said.At present, banks remain open on the first, third and fifth Saturdays of every month.Union leaders said the strike was not aimed at inconveniencing customers. “This movement is not against customers, but for a sustainable, humane, and efficient banking system. A rested banker serves the nation better. A balanced workforce strengthens financial stability. 5-Day banking is not a luxury; it is an economic and human necessity,” L Chandrasekhar, general secretary of the National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), said.An urgent meeting was held on Monday under the chairmanship of the secretary, department of financial services, with the chairman of SBI, managing directors and CEOs of nationalised banks, and the chief executive of the IBA, sources told ANI.Banks were advised to take all necessary steps to ensure smooth functioning of customer services, digital channels, clearing and settlement systems, government business and services delivered through business correspondents.Sources said banks have conveyed that ATMs are being adequately loaded with sufficient cash and arrangements made for timely replenishment. While branch operations may be impacted, digital banking services are expected to remain available seamlessly.Several public sector banks, including SBI, have also informed stock exchanges about the possible impact.“We advise that while the bank has made necessary arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices on the day of strike, it is likely that work in the bank may be impacted by the strike,” SBI said in a regulatory filing on Friday.","Banking operations at public sector banks across the country are likely to be disrupted on Tuesday as bank unions go ahead with a nationwide strike.

'Europe Will Retaliate': America's European Allies FIRE BACK At Trump Over Greenland Tariff Attack

US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent, accusing the ally’s legislature of failing to uphold its trade agreement with the United States.Trump added that South Korea’s legislature has not approved the trade deal he and President Lee Je Myung agreed to on July 30, 2025, and reaffirmed during his visit on October 29, 2025, questioning why it has not been ratified.""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters.South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week.","US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent.

Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”"," decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

Diplomacy Meets Fashion: EU Chief Ursula Dons Traditional Indian Bandhgala At Republic Day Parade

What is Eri silk?

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen drew wide attention on social media after they were seen twinning in a traditional Eri silk scarf during her visit to India.The silk scarf, also known as Eri silk or “Ahimsa silk,” featured elephant motifs and colour-blocked patterns. Ursula along with European Council president Antonio Costa came to India as chief guest for the Republic Day celebrations India and the European Union also announced a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) after nearly 18 years of negotiations.Sharing her thoughts on X, von der Leyen highlighted the significance of the moment and the broader partnership between the two sides.“Europe and India are making history today. We have concluded the mother of all deals. We have created a free trade zone of two billion people, with both sides set to benefit. This is only the beginning. We will grow our strategic relationship to be even stronger,” she wrote.The India-EU FTA, billed by the EU president as the “mother of all deals,” aims to deepen economic ties, reduce trade barriers and create one of the world’s largest free trade zones.The agreement was announced following summit-level talks between Prime Minister Modi and leaders of the 27-nation bloc.The cultural symbolism of the visit was also underscored ahead of Republic Day. Earlier, President Droupadi Murmu shared a video of the specially designed ‘At Home’ invitation sent to guests, which celebrated the living traditions of India’s North Eastern region.In a post on X, the President said the invitation was a tribute to the skilled artisans and craftspeople of the Ashtalakshmi states. “The invitation kit this year celebrates the living traditions of India’s North Eastern Region. This invitation is a tribute to the skilled artisans and craftspersons of the Ashtalakshmi states.”Eri silk, which featured prominently during the visit, holds deep cultural and ethical significance. Native to Assam, it is produced without killing the silkworm, earning it the name “Ahimsa silk.”Known for its warmth, durability and eco-friendly production, Eri silk is traditionally worn during festivals such as Magh Bihu and is closely linked to village life and women-led weaving practices.",PM Narendra Modi and EU President Ursula von der Leyen twinned in a traditional Eri silk scarf during her visit to India.

Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through ‘lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

Bouncing Back From Failure

BENGALURU: India was to ring in its 2026 space calendar with a launch that quietly captured the direction the sector is now taking. The PSLV-C62, carrying a clear private sector imprint, however, failed on Jan 12. Notwithstanding that setback, 2026 is still shaping up as the year when India’s private sector can show results in orbit.Just eight days after the PSLV mission, the country’s first Earth Observation Satellite System (EOSS) under PPP saw a key milestone with the signing of a concession agreement that allows the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground, four months after it won the project from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe)The agreement was between IN-SPACe and Allied Orbits — the special purpose vehicle (SPV) created by the consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space — at the former’s office in Bengaluru.TOI reported earlier in Aug 2025 that the Pixxel-led consortium had won the project through a “zero-bid”. While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, delay in processes saw it signed on Jan 20.The project will create a constellation of 12 satellites, data from which will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium will implement the project through Allied Orbits. “As part of the project, PierSight will build synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, Pixxel will build hyperspectral & high resolution optical satellite, Satsure will make multispectral satellites and Dhruva will develop ground stations,” Gaurav Seth, Piersight CEO and co-founder told TOI.Pixxel CEO Awais Ahmed toldthat their firm was “implementing 60% of the project and investing the same amount to boot.""“Of the 12 satellites, seven will come from Pixxel, three from SatSure and two from PierSight,” Awais said, adding that Pixxel will build two types of satellites: Five of them will be ultra high-res submeter satellite and two will be hyperspectral satellites.Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create the 12-satellite constellation in low-Earth orbit. The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.Aside from this, three private entities will also produce 31 satellites as part of the space-based surveillance (SBS) programme for India’s strategic needs to be used by national security agencies.This is the first time that private industry will be developing satellites for strategic needs. The current SBS programme — built upon the earlier avatars that have seen satellites from the Cartosat and Risat families — will further enhance India’s space surveillance capabilities and see a total of 52 satellites in both geostationary orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO).Twenty-one of these satellites will be developed by Isro and the other 31 will come from the private sector. Together, the project is to cost an estimated Rs 26,000-Rs 27,000 crore — this is expected to be revised.The latest iteration marks a substantial upgrade from its predecessors, incorporating artificial intelligence to enable unprecedented satellite interaction and intelligence gathering.A key innovation of the current SBS will be its integrated network of satellites positioned in both LEO and GEO. This dual-layer system will allow for dynamic cooperation between satellites, with GEO satellites at 36,000km able to detect activities and direct LEO satellites at 400-600km to provide detailed observations.The programme is expected to allocate dedicated satellites to support land, sea, and air-based missions across India’s military services, enhancing the nation’s defense capabilities.At a time India’s aspirations of having a sustainable human presence in space is taking shape in the form of Gaganyaan and Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS) programmes, Bengaluru start-up Akashalabdhi is working on an “expandable space habitat”.A prototype model of the habitat dubbed ‘Antariksh HAB’ is ready. The final version is being designed to accommodate six to 16 personnel and will have an innovative structure that promises superior protection against orbital debris and radiation while boasting versatility.Beyond this single launch, 2026 is expected to see the first large-scale realisation of India’s private launch ambitions.Skyroot Aerospace remains among the most closely watched startups. In late 2025, the company unveiled its Vikram-I orbital rocket along with its “Infinity Campus” in Hyderabad, a facility designed to support parallel rocket design, manufacturing and testing.In 2026, Skyroot aims to conduct its first commercial orbital launch, placing small satellites into low-Earth orbit. The company has indicated an initial cadence of one launch every three months, with plans to scale to monthly missions by 2027. Revenue generation is expected to begin once regular commercial operations are established.Success would mark a turning point: India’s first privately built orbital rocket, launched from Indian soil, carrying paying customer payloads rather than experimental technology demonstrators.Agnikul Cosmos, based in Chennai, is pursuing a different approach. Its launch vehicles are built around modular architectures and patented upper-stage designs that could double as orbital payloads. Internally, the company is targeting monthly launches once its first orbital mission is completed.Agnikul’s emphasis is on adaptability and production efficiency, with engines and stages designed for rapid manufacturing and lower per-mission costs, a potential advantage in an increasingly crowded global small-satellite launch market.Digantara operates in a niche that is gaining urgency worldwide: space domain awareness and orbital intelligence.The company specialises in tracking resident space objects, including debris and active satellites, using its own spacecraft, ground networks and data platforms. In 2025, it launched its first commercial space surveillance satellite, SCOT.In 2026, Digantara plans to deploy at least eight more satellites, primarily through rideshare missions on vehicles such as SpaceX’s Transporter series. It is also close to operationalising a ground-based telescope in India.As low-Earth orbit becomes more congested, such capabilities are increasingly critical, not only for commercial operators but also for defence and civil authorities responsible for collision avoidance and orbital safety.Bellatrix Aerospace has evolved from an early focus on launch vehicles to concentrate on propulsion systems and orbital transport technologies. Its portfolio includes electric propulsion thrusters for small satellites and an orbital transfer vehicle capable of repositioning spacecraft after launch.Recently, Bellatrix and Digantara both entered partnerships with Japan’s Astroscale, a global leader in debris removal and orbital servicing. These collaborations reflect how Indian hardware startups are increasingly plugging into international technology ecosystems.For satellite operators, such propulsion and servicing systems could become essential, enabling low-cost manoeuvring, orbit changes and mission life extension.India’s Earth observation (EO) sector is also entering a new phase. IN-SPACe’s Build–Own–Operate framework began transitioning into implementation in 2025, signalling a shift in how satellite infrastructure and data services are commercialised. It is under this push that Allied Orbits was formed.Separately, Pixxel has already placed its first private batch of hyperspectral imaging satellites in orbit through its Firefly series, serving agriculture, environmental monitoring and resource analysis.Other firms, including Satellize and Grahaa Space, are working on satellite manufacturing and data services, such as near-real-time geospatial video, which could serve both commercial users and strategic agencies.On the launch side, public–private partnership models are beginning to take concrete shape. The LVM-3 heavy-lift programme is being scaled with deeper industry involvement to support future commercial missions.The first PSLV manufactured by a HAL–L&T-led consortium is expected to fly in early 2026, marking a milestone in the industrialisation of India’s launch vehicle production.Technology transfer agreements for the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), and eventually for PSLV manufacturing, are also expected to progress, as part of broader privatisation plans. On Jan 8, Dept of Space issued an EoI inviting industries to build the first module of the proposed Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS).Together, these steps point to a deliberate shift from a research-centric model to a market-driven space economy.Industry associations argue that private momentum will need stronger public backing to sustain scale. The Satcom Industry Association-India (SIA-India), in three coordinated pre-budget submissions prepared in collaboration with KPMG, pointed out that India’s public spending on space, at about 0.04% of GDP, remains well below global norms.It recommended a phased increase to levels closer to the 0.12% seen in leading spacefaring nations, with predictable support for launch capability, satellite constellations, navigation systems and testing infrastructure.SIA-India president Subba Rao Pavuluri said: “From secure communications and navigation to climate systems, launch infrastructure and disaster resilience, every layer of our national architecture now depends on space assets. Granting space the status of critical infrastructure and decisively expanding public investment is essential if we are to match our strategic aspirations and secure our leadership in the Indo-Pacific. ”The Indian Space Association (ISpA) echoed the sense of transition. “Private space startups in India raised nearly $150 million during FY 2025 taking the total funding to over $617 million till date… India’s space sector is moving firmly into an execution-led phase. While challenges remain in manufacturing scale, long-term capital access, and assured demand, the year established a clear foundation for sustained growth, deeper industry participation, and India’s expanding role in the global space economy,” said ISpA director-general Lt Gen (retd) A K Bhatt.Among the 15 satellites onboard PSLV-C62, 13 were from private industry, highlighting how commercial payloads are now becoming the norm rather than the exception on Indian launch vehicles. And the Indian companies that had their payloads and deployers on the rocket are also expected to bounce back.Dhruva Space, whose Polar Access-1 (PA-1), a structured launch programme that would have enabled 10 satellite deployments serving multiple Indian states and international customers, was lost, will aim to get back to orbit.One of the most closely watched payloads on the mission was AyulSat, built by OrbitAID Aerospace. The satellite was designed to demonstrate a technology that would eventually allow the firm to conduct a full-fledged on-orbit refuelling, a capability that could change how satellites are operated and maintained.Now, the firm is looking at launching both the target, and the chaser satellites together sometime later this year.","The PSLV-C62, carrying a clear private sector imprint, however, failed on Jan 12. 2026 is still shaping up as the year when India’s private sector can show results in orbit. The project will create a constellation of 12 satellites, used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127612092,imgsize-96772,width-400,resizemode-4/isros-pslv-c62-mission.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said, even as interest from British and Canadian universities gathers pace under India's liberalised foreign education regime. Officials said that colleges under the University of London and several Canadian universities have also conveyed keenness, with preliminary discussions underway.The momentum follows policy changes that have opened India's higher education sector to foreign universities. The National Education Policy, 2020 first articulated the case for allowing top global institutions to operate locally, and this was operationalised in 2023 through UGC regulations. The rules allow eligible foreign universities to establish independent campuses, design curricula and set admission norms, marking a decisive shift from earlier partnership-only models.There are foreign universities already running physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong at Gujarat's GIFT City, and the UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon. These campuses offer programmes in high-demand areas such as STEM and management, and have demonstrated that overseas institutions can operate within India's regulatory ecosystem.University of Liverpool, University of York and University of Aberdeen, among others are working towards similar operations.Against this backdrop, Purdue University's proposed India campus is being seen as a major credibility boost for the foreign university policy. Sources said discussions have reached an advanced stage, with talks focused on academic offerings, regulatory compliance and operational frameworks. Govt officials indicated that the plan is for Purdue to offer its flagship engineering and technology programmes in India, allowing students to earn a Purdue degree without having to study overseas.","Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said.

Ukrainian Envoy Hails PM Modi As Global Leader, Praises Ukraine Peace Efforts

NEW DELHI: After co-chairing the India-EU summit PM Narendra Modi said India and the EU were natural partners in a changing world and remained committed to strengthening multilateralism. However, Russia’s Ukraine war remained a vexing issue as the EU said it was counting on Modi’s support to end the conflict.European Council President Antonio Costa said in his media statement that the summit reaffirmed their commitment to supporting efforts towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, one that fully respects Ukraine’s “independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity”.“This is a key moment. We are supporting all efforts to reach a just and sustainable peace. Ukraine has shown its readiness, including at the cost of difficult compromises. I know, dear Prime Minister, that we can count on you to help create the conditions for peace, through dialogue and diplomacy,” said Costa, addressing Modi at the joint media event.India’s ties with Russia have been a thorn in the side of the EU since the beginning of the conflict but Brussels didn’t allow it to stand in the way of the grounbreaking trade and defence pacts with India, recognising the need to work with New Delhi in a world marred by unpredictability and disruptions.The EU is also learnt to have urged India to provide more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.Modi said in his own statement that the global order is undergoing profound turbulence and in that context the partnership between India and the EU will strengthen stability within the international system. “Against this backdrop, we held detailed discussions today on several global issues, including Ukraine, West Asia, and the Indo-Pacific,” said the PM, adding that respect for multilateralism and international norms remained a shared priority.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said EU leaders expressed their concerns about the conflict and the PM indicated to them he had been in close touch with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders. “We favor a negotiated solution between the parties most closely concerned with this conflict. The PM himself has advocated this to both leaders. He has publicly stated that India is ready to do whatever is needed to support the outcomes from such a negotiated solution. And that we are interested in seeing the earliest possible cessation of this conflict,” said Misri.The leaders also discussed the Gaza situation, calling for a just and lasting solution, based on the implementation of the two-State solution, through dialogue and diplomacy.According to the joint statement, they noted the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 2803 of 17 November 2025 which welcomes the establishment of the Board of Peace and authorizes an International Stabilisation Force, as outlined in the Comprehensive Plan, as a step forward to end the Gaza conflict.Both India and the EU have reservations about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace initiative which, unlike what is mandated by the resolution, will look to resolve conflicts all over the world and not just Gaza.In the statement, Modi and the EU leaders encouraged all parties to implement the resolution in its entirety, in line with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions. “Both sides restated their readiness to support efforts towards just and durable peace and stressed the need for unhindered humanitarian access,” said the joint statement.","PM Narendra Modi said India and the EU were natural partners in a changing world.

.

NEW DELHI: Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids of up to 48% less than the estimated project cost, largely due to aggressive bidding, which usually has a direct bearing on the quality of work.In a recent case, the road transport ministry cancelled a tender for a project in Manipur as the contractor with the lowest bid quoted 47% less than the cost the ministry had estimated. The contractor challenged the bid cancellation in Gauhati high court, and the court ordered an interim stay. ""This case is a classic example of how highway agencies are caught in the middle. Highway contractors are getting projects quoting low bids arguing they have quoted price after carrying out detailed assessment,"" said an official.Data since April 2023 showed that because of less number of projects being offered, there is fierce competition among bidders. For each tender, the number of bidders is in the range of seven to 19.Officials and industry insiders said that while there has been a huge increase in the number of highway contractors in the past 7-8 years, with govt rolling out a large number of projects and also bringing down the qualification criteria, there has been a significant fall in the number of works being bid.""This has resulted in players quoting low bids to ensure that their manpower and machinery do not lie idle, which causes further financial stress. This trend will hurt the sector and quality of work as well since we can't reject a lowest cost or L1 bid in construction works,"" said another official.The details of some of the low quoted bids since 2023-24 showed that a project in Madhya Pradesh - four-laning of Rahatgarh to Berkhedi - was bid out at Rs 324 crore, which was 48.4% less than NHAI's bid cost of Rs 627 crore. In the case of another project in Maharashtra - augmentation of existing stretch in urban areas of Pune on the Pune-Satara section - was bid out at Rs 321 crore, around 46% less than the project cost estimated by the highway authority.Similarly, the work for four-laning from Dareota to Kalar Bala in Himachal Pradesh was tendered at Rs 435 crore against NHAI's project cost of Rs 734 crore this year, which was around 41% less.","Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids.

UGC Equity Regulations Explained: What Exists What Changed And Why It Has Sparked Protests

New Delhi: As University Grants Commission’s regulation on promotion of equity in higher educational institutions has stirred a huge debate with a few sections split along the caste divide, a petition has been filed in the apex court for declaring it illegal and unconstitutional for being discriminatory and not covering harassment of non-SC/ST/OBC students.UGC framed the law on the suggestion of the apex court to put in place a mechanism to prevent ragging, sexual harassment, and discrimination on the basis of caste, gender, and disability in educational institutions.The bone of contention is its Section 3(1)(c) which says “caste-based discrimination’’ is against members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other backward classes. The petition sought SC’s intervention to direct UGC and the Centre to ensure everything prescribed under the regulation, be caste-neutral and not only for SC/ST/OBC.",University Grants Commission’s regulation on promotion of equity in higher educational institutions has stirred a huge debate with a few sections split along the caste divide.

Census 2027 To Kick Off As Government Seeks Data On Homes, Food, Internet And How India Lives Today

New Delhi: The home ministry on Tuesday countered the ""deliberate misinformation campaign"" by the opposition painting the govt as non-serious about caste enumeration, based merely on the Census 2027 ""houselisting"" questionnaire notified last week, despite govt's well-known public stand that caste will be captured in the second stage of the census, that is, population enumeration phase due in Feb next year, that is 2027.Sources said that the sequencing is not something new and recalled that the questionnaire for population enumeration stage of Census 2011 was notified by the then UPA govt only towards the end of the first stage of the census - the ""houselisting and housing"" phase held from April 1 to Sept 30, 2010. As per the notification issued on Aug 31, 2010, a total of 29 questions were listed for the census officer to collect information from persons within his or her area, through the housing schedule.The ""houselisting"" schedule or questionnaire for Census 2011, notified on Feb 25, 2010, had listed 30 questions, unlike 33 questions included in the Census 2027 ""housing"" schedule notified on Jan 22.""Full information on Census 2027 was put out in a press statement dated Dec 12, 2025. Yet, some people are intentionally trying to spread falsehoods about Census 2027, particularly the caste census,"" the home ministry spokesperson said on X a day after Congress's Jairam Ramesh reiterated his allegation questioning the govt's intent to conduct a caste-wise enumeration.""It has been clearly outlined that Census 2027 shall be conducted in two phases, with the caste census due only in the second phase. This two-stage schedule - the first stage being 'houselisting and housing phase' and second, 'population enumeration' - replicates the practice followed in all previous censuses,"" ministry said while attaching its Dec 2025 press statement put out after the Union cabinet approved a proposal to conduct Census 2027 at a cost of Rs 11,718 crore.Sources said the questions to be asked during the population enumeration phase in Feb 2027, including those intended at recording a respondent's caste, may be notified only in Aug or Sept this year.In fact, the questionnaire for the second stage of Census 2021 was yet to be notified when the Covid pandemic forced its postponement days before it was scheduled to start on Apr 1, 2020.","The home ministry on Tuesday countered the ""deliberate misinformation campaign"" by the opposition.

Affidavit rider to complaints to offer relief to public servants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/affidavit-rider-to-complaints-to-offer-relief-to-public-servants/articleshow/127655809.cms,"New Delhi: An allegation made against a public servant before a magistrate will not be sufficient to put in motion proceedings against him as Supreme Court Tuesday ruled that the complaint must be backed by an affidavit. The court said it was needed to ensure that judicial proceedings were not misused ""to settle a score"".While interpreting section 175 of Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan said that the section was somewhat confusing and needed judicial interpretation.""Suffice it to record at the outset that BNSS being a statute of recent origin, which has been enacted after exactly half a century of its precursor (CrPC), governing the field of criminal procedure, one would have expected the legislative drafting thereof to be of the highest order with clear expression of the will of the people. Sadly, Section 175 BNSS is somewhat confusing and requires ironing out the creases in the legislation without altering the material of which it is woven,"" the bench said.The court said the legislative intention behind insertion of sub-section (4) of Section 175 was clear: Parliament intended it as an additional safeguard for public servants when a complaint was made against them. ""Cognizant of practical realities and to prevent false or frivolous allegations, it appears to us that the mandate is to obtain a report from the accused public servant's superior officer and to extend to such a public servant an opportunity to explain his side of the story.While society's interest is served by prosecuting offenders, it is equally vital, if not more, to ensure that prosecution is not launched against individuals, including public servants, to settle a score or wreak vengeance or put them in such an awkward position that it becomes difficult for them to act in a similar future occasion. The responsibility, nay duty, after all, is not just to pursue the actual culprit, but also to protect the innocent from being falsely implicated, wrongly accused and unnecessarily victimised,"" it said.Section 175(4) says any judicial magistrate empowered under Section 210 may, upon receiving a complaint against a public servant arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, take cognizance, subject to - (a) receiving a report containing facts and circumstances of the incident from the officer superior to him; and (b) after consideration of the assertions made by the public servant as to the situation that led to the incident so alleged.The court said sub-section (4) was not an independent provision but operated subject to the procedural safeguards that sub-section (3) embodied, including the requirement that the application be supported by an affidavit.","Supreme Court rules that complaint must be backed by an affidavit.

It emphasises the contours of “techno-legal” AI governance framework that is necessary to mitigate risks while preserving flexibility and innovation.The 40-page paper also highlights India’s pro-innovation approach to AI governance, which integrates baseline legal safeguards, sector-specific regulations, technical controls and institutional mechanisms.“Developing a robust and responsive governance framework is not just a regulatory necessity but a prerequisite for sustaining the momentum of technological progress. The techno-legal approach offers a viable pathway by embedding legal, technical and institutional safeguards into AI systems by design,” said PSA Ajay Kumar Sood during the release of the white paper on Jan 23.In his foreword to the paper, he noted that while AI has significant “transformative potential”, it is essential to ensure that the associated risks and harm do not undermine trust or become a barrier to innovation and adoption.Exploring laws, rules and regulatory mechanisms, the framework suggests ways and means in which AI can be used securely without eroding public trust. The paper also signifies India’s contribution to making the entire ecosystem safe, of which its hosting of the AI Impact Summit 2026, the first-ever global AI summit to be held in the Global South, is an indicator.India as the summit’s host will shape a future-oriented agenda for impactful AI cooperation and help mark a strategic shift from ""action"" to ""Impact"".The upcoming summit aims to ensure that AI serves as a catalyst for inclusive human development, environmental sustainability and equitable progress worldwide, bridging the Global AI Divide through concrete multilateral action.The publication is the second in the White Paper series on ‘Emerging Policy Priorities for India’s AI Ecosystem’ that aims at deepening understanding and fostering informed discussion on critical AI policy issues.The first White Paper in the series, released in Dec 2025, focused on “democratising access to AI infrastructure”, highlighting the need to treat AI infrastructure as a shared national resource and identifying key enablers such as access to high-quality datasets, affordable computing resources and integration with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), said the office of PSA in a statement.","India-AI Impact Summit scheduled next month in New Delhi.

Rahul Gandhi Targets Modi Over Us Textile Tariffs, Bjp Fires Back

NEW DELHI: Accusing the Modi govt of fudging data to present a rosy picture, Congress on Tuesday expressed concern over the state of the Indian economy in the wake of what it called is questionable growth and production coupled with rising inequality and dimming welfare.Ahead of the President’s joint address to Parliament, economic survey and Union budget, Congress released its “real state of the economy 2026 report” to put “facts” before the people as the govt would indulge in “propaganda” in the coming days.Congress spokespersons Rajeev Gowda and Amitabh Dubey released the annual report with the title “inequality on the rise, welfare in retreat”.“IMF gave India’s statistics a C grade. 0.5% inflation rate is not the reality of people’s lives. Former economic advisor Arvind Subramanian calculates that GDP figures are at least 2.5% higher than actual reality,” the spokespersons said.Questioning govt data, Gowda said manufacturing in the first half of 2025-26 grew at 8.4%, but the Index of Eight Core Industries showed only 2.9% growth. At the same time, he said the Rupee has been Asia’s worst performing currency in 2025.Congress said the most alarming fact is that between 2017-18 and 2023-24, the share of workers in manufacturing fell from 12.1% to 11.4%, while it rose in agriculture from 44.1% to 46.1%.“Job growth is concentrated in low value, informal, and gig economy,” it said.Expressing concern over “rising inequality”, Gowda said the top 10% capture 58% of national income while the bottom half receives only 15%. He said the top 10% own 65% of India's wealth. Alongside, he said, four of five Indians subsist on less than Rs 200 per day.Gowda and Dubey said net household financial savings are at a five-decade low of 5.2% while household debt has sharply risen to 41% from 35% in 2019.Congress said the best welfare net for the poor was MGNREGA but the job scheme has now been dismantled which will hurt the deprived sections the most.","Congress accuses the Modi govt of fudging data to present a rosy picture.

NEW DELHI: Even as hospital deliveries resumed after Covid, India recorded a sharp rise in babies dying just before birth in the post-pandemic period, according to a major national study analysing births between 2019 and 2022. The findings point to serious gaps in pregnancy care—losses that often go unnoticed and are grieved in private.The rise was driven by disrupted antenatal care, delayed referrals and weakened pregnancy and delivery services during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers said. The study documented a 44% increase in the stillbirth rate between the pre-Covid and post-Covid periods.The study, published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, was conducted by researchers from the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) with support from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It is based on a nationally representative mortality survey covering nearly one million people across nine states—Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.Data show that India’s stillbirth rate increased from 12.7 per 1,000 births before Covid to 14.4 during the pandemic, and then rose sharply to 18.3 per 1,000 births in the post-Covid period.The increase was most pronounced in rural areas, where rates reached nearly 20 per 1,000 births, compared to about 14 in urban areas, highlighting gaps in access to timely antenatal care and emergency obstetric services.Based on detailed interviews of 745 stillbirths, the study found that 44.7% occurred in public hospitals, 39.2% in private hospitals and 16.1% at home. The dominant place of delivery varied sharply across states: stillbirths were reported mostly from private hospitals in Kerala (66.7%), Gujarat (60%) and Haryana (50%), while public hospitals accounted for the majority in Odisha (72.6%), Assam (69.6%), Maharashtra (54.8%) and Tamil Nadu (54.6%), reflecting differences in health system utilisation rather than state-wise stillbirth rates.More than half of all stillbirths occurred at nine months of pregnancy or later, often just days before delivery, pointing to failures in late-pregnancy monitoring and delivery-time care.Explaining this, Dr Renu Gupta, Director (Obstetrics & Robotic Gynaecology), Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Delhi, said: “The rise in late-term stillbirths points to failures in timely risk detection and action, not gaps in early pregnancy care. After Covid, third-trimester monitoring—blood pressure, fetal growth and movement, Doppler studies—has become inconsistent, especially in overstretched public hospitals. Referral delays, staff shortages and weak transport systems mean warning signs are often missed. While delivery numbers have recovered, quality and continuity of care have not, leading to preventable losses just before birth.”Delays were a major factor. Nearly one in five women whose babies were stillborn had been referred between facilities during labour, sometimes being sent back to return later.Only about one-third of mothers were told why their baby died. Despite registration being mandatory, just 1% of stillbirths were officially registered, keeping most cases out of official records.The study also highlighted the emotional toll on families. Nearly half of mothers neither saw nor held their stillborn baby, often due to family decisions or medical advice.Researchers warned that without stronger antenatal surveillance, faster referrals and better quality care during labour and childbirth, India may miss its target of a single-digit stillbirth rate by 2030 under the India Newborn Action Plan.","India recorded a sharp rise in babies dying just before birth in the post- pandemic period.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

NEW DELHI: Union minister of parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday made it clear that the government will not roll back the newly introduced VB–GRAM–G law, stating that the Parliament cannot “reverse gear” on legislation already placed before the nation.The statement comes even as opposition parties pressed for wider debates during the upcoming Budget Session Rijiju was speaking to reporters after an all-party meeting held ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament. The meeting was chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by senior leaders, including Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha JP Nadda, ministers Arjun Ram Meghwal and L Murugan and floor leaders of various parties.“Once law is before the nation, we have to follow it. We can’t reverse gear and go back to the past. It cannot happen,” he said.Setting the government’s priorities for the session, Rijiju said the focus would remain on budgetary business. “We have noted the suggestions given by floor leaders of various parties. As per the rules, the discussions should revolve around the Budget only,” he said.He said the Budget Session, the first Parliament session of the year, will begin with the President’s address to a joint sitting, followed by the tabling of the Economic Survey on January 29 and presentation of the Union Budget on February 1.“Since this is a Budget Session, the main focus of this session will be on the budget,” Rijiju said, while urging parties to ensure smooth functioning of Parliament.Responding to opposition demands for discussions on multiple issues, including new UGC guidelines, Rijiju said the government was not averse to debate but stressed constitutional responsibilities.“Why should we talk about just one issue? The government is always ready to discuss various issues. However, this is Budget Session, we have to pass the Budget, run the country, serve the people,” he said.The union minister also rejected allegations that the legislative agenda was not shared in advance. “Government business is shared after the President’s address in the first session of the year,” Rijiju said.Emphasising parliamentary conduct, the minister said, “We are elected to raise people’s issues and have freedom of speech, but it is also our duty to listen,” adding that various issues could be raised during the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s address and during Budget discussions.Opposition parties, however, reiterated their demands for wider debates during the Budget Session, stating that several issues of public importance must be discussed on the floor of Parliament.Speaking after the all-party meeting, Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghose said that her party had strongly pushed for a discussion on the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process in West Bengal. She alleged that the manner in which the exercise is being conducted raises serious concerns.“On behalf of the Trinamool Congress and the All India Trinamool Congress, we reiterated in the all-party meeting that the ongoing SIR process in West Bengal must be discussed on the floor of Parliament during the Budget Session,” Ghose said.She further claimed that the exercise lacks transparency and neutrality and flagged large-scale discrepancies. “A so-called ‘logical discrepancy list’ has been prepared, containing the names of around 1.5 crore people, and this too must be debated. More than 130 people have reportedly lost their lives during the SIR exercise, and this issue must also be discussed in Parliament,” she said.Raising broader concerns, Ghose said opposition-ruled states were being unfairly treated. “Funds meant for states, especially opposition-ruled states, cannot be withheld in this manner and must be released. The misuse of central agencies in poll-bound states, including the filing of ED cases, must also be taken up for discussion,” she said.Emphasising the role of the opposition, Ghose added, “Parliament is not a one-way street. The opposition must be given an opportunity to speak, and its voice must be heard. Bills cannot be passed in two or three minutes; they should be sent to committees and sufficient time should be given for proper study.”Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MP ET Mohammed Basheer also said that key issues needed parliamentary discussion. “Parliament has become a mockery. I have raised several issues, including SIR, that must be discussed during the Budget Session,” he said.Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Sasmit Patra said his party would raise multiple concerns during the session. “The first relates to farmers and their welfare, and the second relates to the situation in Odisha,” he said, adding that farmers were under distress, law and order was deteriorating in the state, youth unemployment remained a major concern, and employment opportunities under the new GRAM-G bill were limited.The remarks came amid opposition criticism of the Centre’s proposal to repeal the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and replace it with the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–GRAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill, listed in the supplementary business for the session, seeks to expand guaranteed rural employment from 100 to 125 days and align rural development with the government’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision.","Kiren Rijiju says the government will not roll back the newly introduced VB–GRAM–G law.

"India carries Asia’s heaviest lung disease burden, Lancet study finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-carries-asias-heaviest-lung-disease-burden-lancet-study-finds/articleshow/127604539.cms,"NEW DELHI: India accounts for more than 43% of Asia’s chronic respiratory disease–related disability, the highest share in the region, according to a new analysis published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine on Wednesday. The study identifies air pollution as a major factor behind India’s persistently high lung disease burden.The study, based on estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2023, found that Asia as a whole contributed nearly 67% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to chronic respiratory diseases in 2023. India alone accounted for 43.3% of Asia’s DALYs, while China contributed 27.8%, together making up over 70% of the regional burden, largely driven by population size and sustained exposure to risk factors.In 2023, India’s age-standardised DALY rate from chronic respiratory diseases remained above 2,040 per 100,000 population, among the highest in Asia, reflecting a substantial burden of disability and premature mortality linked to respiratory conditions, despite a gradual decline since 1990.Explaining what this translates to on the ground, Dr G.C. Khilnani, pulmonologist and Chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, said respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, asthma and COPD are now among the most common conditions seen in clinical practice, with children and the elderly particularly vulnerable.He said delayed diagnosis worsens outcomes, while air pollution has emerged as a major driver—accounting for nearly half of COPD cases and a growing share of lung cancers, including among non-smokers.South Asia, driven largely by India, recorded the highest age-standardised prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Asia at 3,044 cases per 100,000 population. While prevalence across Asian regions was broadly similar, the analysis found that disability and deaths were significantly higher in lower-income regions, pointing to poorer outcomes rather than higher disease occurrence.Dr Ujjwal Parakh, Senior Consultant in Chest Medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said chronic respiratory diseases—particularly COPD—are steadily increasing in India and are often diagnosed late due to low awareness and limited access to spirometry. With air pollution damaging lungs much like tobacco smoke, he said controlling pollution and improving early detection are critical.The study identified ambient particulate matter pollution and household air pollution from solid fuels as major contributors to India’s respiratory disease burden. Household air pollution in South Asia was associated with an age-standardised DALY rate of 658 per 100,000 population, among the highest globally.Researchers cautioned that although age-standardised DALY rates for most chronic respiratory diseases have declined across Asia over the past three decades, uneven progress, persistent pollution exposure and gaps in access to care threaten to slow or reverse gains. Without sustained improvements in air quality, cleaner household energy use and equitable respiratory care, the study warned, India’s lung disease burden is likely to remain high.",Study identifies air pollution as a major factor behind India’s persistently high lung disease burden. Asia as a whole contributed nearly 67% of global disability-adjusted life years due to chronic respiratory diseases in 2023.

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: In a move that may help India's high-emission industries navigate the EU's carbon border tax regime by adopting clean manufacturing processes in due course, Niti Aayog, the govt think tank, has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors. This will also contribute to the country achieving its long-term net-zero emission (carbon neutrality) goal for 2070.The EU's carbon border tax -- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) -- is a tool to put a price on high-emission goods such as cement, aluminium, iron & steel and fertilisers that enter the 27 EU nations.If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will continue to attract tariff burden in the form of carbon border tax, impacting the country’s exports.The decarbonisation roadmaps for cement and aluminium, released by Niti Aayog last Wednesday, will also serve as reference manuals for India to decarbonise other sectors, in sync with the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement.The Aayog’s report shows that cement manufacturing, a significant source of carbon emissions, contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e of emissions worldwide in 2023.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions, which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Under the decarbonisation strategy, as suggested by the roadmap, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13tCO₂e per tonne by 2070.To enable deep decarbonisation in this sector, the roadmap proposes to prioritise the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scale-up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme.Similarly, the decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies a three-phase solution: transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC), enhanced grid connectivity in the short term and adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The report reveals that production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023.",Niti Aayog has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Limited Room for Tax Relief

The Next Phase of

Tax Simplification

Administrative Reforms

Take away

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Odisha bandh today: Farmers protest paddy procurement issues; traffic likely hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/statewide-bandh-by-farmers-today/articleshow/127648256.cms,"



BHUBANESWAR: Traffic may be affected on Wednesday as a farmers’ organisation, Navnirman Krushak Sangathan (NKS), has called for a statewide bandh in protest against alleged problems in paddy procurement.NKS convenor Akshay Kumar said that the bandh will not affect railways and any emergency services. However, farmers will demonstrate on roads as part of the bandh from 6 am to 2 pm while the NKS has appealed business and commercial establishments to down shutters.Akshay said apart from govt’s failure to lift paddy on time, the protest will highlight loot of people, especially farmers, in the name of installing smart meters for electricity. Besides, illogical fines on people in the name of not doing pollution under check certificates.Responding to the bandh call, BJP spokesperson Manoj Mohapatra said the protest is planned by non-farmers. “Farmers in Odisha are very happy with the Mohan Charan Majhi govt because of its pro-farmer initiatives such as Rs 800 per quintal bonus for paddy,” he said.Amiya Kumar Pattnaik, national coordinator of All India Kisan Congress, farmers’ wing of Congress, said the party will fully support the bandh call as farmers are in distress. BJD spokesperson Lenin Mohanty said, “BJD has thanked the NKS for raising farmers’ issue even as the party will go ahead with its own agitation plan district-wise from Feb 2 and a massive demonstration in Bhubaneswar on Feb 24.”","Farmers' organisation, Navnirman Krushak Sangathan (NKS), has called for a statewide bandh in protest against alleged problems in paddy procurement.

Akhenaten changed Egypt’s direction

Signs of everyday work and industry

Evidence of reuse under later rulers

What the discovery adds to Egyptian history





Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years, offering a detailed look at daily life during one of ancient Egypt’s most powerful periods. The settlement was built under Pharaoh Amenhotep III and later inherited by his son Akhenaten, whose radical religious reforms reshaped Egyptian history. Found within the ancient capital of Thebes, the site includes homes, workshops, administrative buildings and burial areas, many preserved to an unusual degree. Officials described it in 2021 as the “lost golden city of Luxor”, pointing to its scale and condition rather than any single monument. The discovery adds context to a period marked by wealth, upheaval and a sudden break with long-held tradition. Artefacts, streets, ovens, seals, and walls reveal economic organisation, craft production, family routines, and governance structures fragmented across Egypt’s record. National Geographic mentions excavation revealed a dense urban area enclosed by mudbrick walls that in places rise to around nine feet. Inside, rooms were filled with everyday objects left where they were last used.Pottery vessels, tools and food remains suggested the city was active and organised, rather than ceremonial alone. Some buildings appeared domestic, while others showed signs of planning and record keeping. Archaeologists also identified streets and defined neighbourhoods, hinting at a carefully managed royal settlement rather than a temporary camp.The 18th dynasty, when Amenhotep III ruled, was characterised by powerful diplomacy, abundant resources, and large-scale construction projects. Throughout Egypt, his court supervised buildings, statues, and temples. This activity seems to have been fostered by the recently discovered city, which served as an administrative and industrial hub connected to the larger capital at Thebes. Evidence of large-scale food preparation was discovered alongside items associated with the manufacturing of glass and metal. This confirms long-held beliefs that Amenhotep III's rule was one of excess and stability, based on a sophisticated labour system.After Amenhotep III’s death, his son Akhenaten took a sharply different path. He rejected Egypt’s traditional gods in favour of a single sun deity, Aten, and moved the royal court to a new city called Akhetaten, now known as Amarna. Recent findings indicate the transition may have been gradual rather than sudden, with administration and daily life continuing smoothly for years. The discovery near Luxor suggests Akhenaten inherited a functioning and productive city, raising questions about why he chose to abandon Thebes altogether. Archaeologists believe the settlement was active during the early years of his rule, before being partially left behind as power shifted north.One of the most striking aspects of the site was the amount of material linked to ordinary labour. A bakery and kitchen complex was identified, with large ovens and storage jars. Other areas showed traces of workshops used for jewellery, metal tools and decorative objects. These findings help balance the historical record, which often focuses on kings and temples rather than workers and craftspeople. The layout suggests people lived close to where they worked, within a tightly organised royal economy.The city did not vanish immediately after Akhenaten’s reign. Archaeologists found signs that it was reused during the time of Tutankhamun, who restored traditional religion and ruled from Memphis rather than Thebes or Amarna. Objects from later periods suggested continued, though reduced, activity. Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamun, may also have made use of the site. Layers of occupation showed that parts of the settlement remained in use well into the Coptic Byzantine era before finally being covered by sand.The importance of the site lies less in spectacle and more in detail. Its preservation allows archaeologists to study how a royal city functioned at ground level. It also provides context for one of Egypt’s most dramatic political and religious shifts. Rather than viewing Akhenaten’s reforms in isolation, researchers can now place them against the backdrop of a thriving urban centre he chose to leave behind. The city near Luxor does not answer every question, but it quietly fills gaps in a long and complicated story.","Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years.

Discover everything about the automotive world at Times of India.

India’s long-pending free trade agreement with the European Union is close to being announced, Reuters reported. This deal could bring significant relief for buyers of imported luxury cars. According to the report, the deal will see India sharply reduce import duties on cars from EU countries, a move that could make premium models from brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen far more affordable over time.At present, India imposes import tariffs on fully built cars, with duties ranging from 70 percent to as high as 110 percent. Under the proposed India–EU FTA, these peak duties are expected to be brought down to 40 percent initially.As per a Reuters report, India has proposed cutting duties to 40 percent for up to around 200,000 internal combustion engine vehicles imported annually from the EU. The final quota is still under discussion and could be revised before the agreement is formally signed. Initially, the lower duty is likely to apply only to fully built cars priced above 15,000 euros, which is roughly Rs 16.3 lakh.Over the longer term, the agreement could lead to even deeper cuts.However, the benefits will not extend to electric vehicles in the early years. As per the report, EVs will be excluded from the reduced duty structure for at least the first five years, as the government looks to safeguard investments made by domestic manufacturers in the electric mobility space. Similar concessions for electric cars are expected to be considered at a later stage.The timing of the announcement is also significant. The proposed tariff cuts come as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is on a four-day visit to India, during which summit-level talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected.","India's long-pending free trade agreement with the European Union is close to being announced.

E-buses now serve 40% of DTC’s daily ridership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/e-buses-now-serve-40-of-dtcs-daily-ridership/articleshow/127676829.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Electric buses have silently gone from being a novelty to the backbone of city transport in two years, now logging nearly 88% of the total daily distance covered by CNG buses.When electric buses first hit Delhi’s roads in 2022, the 300-strong fleet served just 5% of DTC’s 25 lakh daily passengers. By 2024–25, electric buses were carrying nearly 10 lakh passengers daily, nearly 40% of DTC’s average ridership of 25.6 lakh.The surge signals a shifttowards zero tailpipe-emission bus mobility. In these two years, while electric buses increased from 300 to 1,725, accounting for over 45% of the corporation’s fleet, CNG buses declined by 34% (from 3,637 to 2,094).Proportionately, the daily ridership on CNG buses dropped from nearly 24 lakh in 2022–23 to 15 lakh in 2024–25, as electric buses expanded and replaced them, Delhi government data show.Delhi first introduced CNG buses in 2001 after a Supreme Court order mandated a shift from diesel-run buses to control air pollution. The city also has the most robust metro train network in the country.All DTC electric buses are air-conditioned and lowfloor, and outnumber CNG AC buses (909).They cover 2.9 lakh km a day on average, against 3.3 lakh km covered by all CNG buses.ADTC official said the share of electric bus share will significantly rise by March-end.Delhi’s electric bus journey began on Jan 17, 2022 when one blue bus rolled out on the Pragati Maidan–IP Depot route of 27km. It was astonishingly quiet and quicker compared with the roaring lumbering CNG buses, and of course cleaner. Within months, more buses were introduced. The code is clear: blue for electric, red for air-conditioned CNG, green for non-AC.Govt scaled up electric buses in the city due to their zero tailpipe emissions, lowfloor accessible design, and lower operating costs.A Delhi govt official said central govt schemes such asFAME II, which provides subsidies for the EV transition, played a key role in speeding up the expansion.In these two years, the overall DTC bus ridership has also seen an uptick of 50,000 a day.Amit Bhatt, the India managing director at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), said the trend reflects sustained policy support and better service quality. “National schemes such as FAME II and the current PM E-DRIVE initiative enabled large-scale deployment of electric buses. Given current trends, Delhi is well positioned to fully transition its bus fleet to electric and expand services further in the coming years,” he said.","When electric buses first hit Delhi’s roads in 2022, the 300-strong fleet served just 5% of DTC's 25 lakh daily passengers.

What comes next: A golden future?



Where Else But Dubai? A Street Dedicated Entirely to Gold Is on the Way





All that glitters is not gold but in Dubai it may soon be as the UAE emirate has announced plans to build what it calls the world’s first Gold Street, which will be constructed using gold elements in the heart of a newly launched Dubai Gold District. This marks a glittering new chapter in the emirate’s retail and trade landscape.Unveiled by Ithra Dubai as part of a purpose-built destination designed to bring together the entire gold and jewellery value chain, from retail to bullion trading and investment, the Gold Street is envisioned as both an architectural marvel and a signature attraction for visitors and global traders.Dubai’s connection to gold is not new as the emirate has long been a global hub for the precious metal. In 2024-25, the UAE exported around USD 53.41 billion worth of gold, cementing its place as the second-largest physical gold trading destination in the world, with key partners including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong and Türkiye.However, Gold Street is more than a marketing gimmick. It is being positioned as a symbolic and commercial cornerstone of the broader Dubai Gold District. Together with gold retail, bullion trading, wholesale markets and investment services clustered in one place, Dubai is staking a claim to lead the future of gold commerce.Rather than a single street of golden pavement, Gold Street is part of a vast, unified ecosystem that Dubai’s leaders hope will serve shoppers, traders, investors and tourists alike:Officials say the Gold Street will complement this infrastructure by acting as a central attraction that celebrates gold not only as a commodity but as a cultural, artistic and tourism asset.The launch of the Dubai Gold District comes during a momentous period for the UAE’s economy, as the country seeks to diversify away from hydrocarbons and further develop sectors like trade, tourism, luxury retail and investment services. Dubai’s leadership has made no secret of the goal to position the emirate as a global gateway for commerce, culture and leisure and the Gold District fits squarely within that strategy.According to Issam Galadari, CEO of Ithra Dubai, the district “brings together heritage, scale and opportunity,” creating a diverse ecosystem of traders, retailers, investors and global brands that serve shoppers and buyers across international markets.Ahmed Al Khaja, CEO of Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment, noted that the Gold District marks a defining moment in Dubai’s evolution as a global destination for commerce and tourism. He described gold as “deeply woven into the cultural and commercial fabric of Dubai,” symbolising the emirate’s prosperity and entrepreneurial spirit.While the idea of a street made of gold conjures images of pure opulence, industry insiders see deeper commercial and strategic value:Officials have said that details about the Gold Street’s design and construction will be revealed in phases. Though timing has not yet been fully disclosed, developers emphasise that Gold Street will complement Dubai’s existing commercial and cultural fabric, rather than operate as a standalone installation.As Dubai continues to expand its role in global gold markets and builds out attractions that blend luxury, culture and commerce, the Gold District anchored by the promised Gold Street may become both a symbol of the emirate’s economic confidence and a vibrant global destination for buyers and tourists alike.Dubai’s launch of the Dubai Gold District and plans for the world’s first Gold Street reflect how the city continues to innovate in retail, tourism and global trade, using its strategic strengths to shape future growth. By consolidating the gold and jewellery landscape under one roof and adding an iconic gold-lined street, Dubai is not just celebrating its heritage; it is redefining the way gold is experienced in the 21st century.","Dubai has announced plans to build what it calls the world’s first Gold Street. It will be constructed using gold elements in the heart of a newly launched Dubai Gold District. The district already has more than 1,000 retailers spanning gold, jewellery, perfumery, cosmetics and lifestyle sectors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127676304,imgsize-75612,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-to-build-worlds-first-gold-street-inside-a-new-global-gold-district.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
