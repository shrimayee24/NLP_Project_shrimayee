Municipal solid and liquid waste in India can be turned into a Rs 5-lakh-crore business, Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari said in his inaugural address at The Times of India Social Impact Summit in Mumbai.“With the right approach, we can convert waste into wealth, create jobs, and address environmental concerns,” he said. “Plastics can be turned into fuel, sewage into industrial-grade water, and even garbage into commercially viable products,” he added.Citing a project in Mathura that treats sewage flowing into the Yamuna, he said, “That treated water is now being used by nearby Indian Oil refinery.” The particulates are treated with organic culture while the extracted sludge is turned into bio-flocculants. “If we scale this up nationally, the potential is enormous,” he said.Gadkari drew from personal experience, saying: “For the past nine years, I have been selling treated toilet water from my constituency, earning Rs 300 crore annually.”He highlighted clean energy as another area of potential. “Thermal plants have traditionally used coal, but NTPC and the Maharashtra govt have started using biomass—also known as white coal.It costs Rs 7 per unit but is far cleaner,” he said.With 17 percent of India’s land classified as wasteland, he proposed bamboo plantations for biomass. “We’ve invested Rs 5 crore to develop 1.5 lakh ha. Tree plantations around mines can earn carbon credits,” he said.A deeper rethinking of CSR in India is the need of the hour, said Sivakumar Sundaram, CEO (Publishing), The Times of India. “India’s CSR investment was approximately Rs 30,000 crore last year,” he said. “But more important than the quantum is the quality—how we measure impact, how we embed sustainability into strategy, and how we turn compliance into conscience.”The summit was presented by Malabar gold & diamonds with HAL as PSU partner, FUEL (skill partner), E&Y (knowledge partner) and supported by Times Foundation.","The Union minister laid out a vision for an ecologically sustainable growth model that can blend commerce with carbon credits. “Plastics can be turned into fuel, sewage into industrial-grade water, and even garbage into commercially viable products,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122483731,imgsize-1120023,width-400,resizemode-4/122483731.jpg"

Girl child dropouts are not just an education issue but a deep-rooted socio-economic crisis demanding multi-departmental collaboration. A dropout, panellists at ‘Education: Micro Learning, Macro Impact: Bridging the Learning Gap’ session warned, increases the risk of child marriage, teenage pregnancy, poor maternal health, and entrenched poverty.

ISS crew including Shubhanshu Shukla shows you - watch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/looks-chaotic-but-it-works-how-astronauts-take-group-photos-in-space-iss-crew-including-shubhanshu-shukla-shows-you-watch/articleshow/122481227.cms,"NEW DELHI: A light-hearted video from the International Space Station (ISS) featuring Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla has gone viral on social media, showing the Ax-4 crew attempting to take group photos in microgravity. The video was shared by Colonel Anne McClain, who captured the crew’s playful struggle to pose mid-air.“How do we take group photos in space? We cannot ask a passerby for help, so we set up a camera to take a photo every 5 seconds, get in position, then stop to smile at the camera. Looks a little chaotic, but it works!” McClain wrote on X.The cheerful moment surfaced just hours before Shukla and his fellow Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crew members undocked from the ISS on Monday, wrapping up a nearly 20-day scientific mission in orbit.Launched aboard SpaceX’s Falcon-9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center on June 25, the Ax-4 mission covered over 310 orbits and travelled 1.3 crore km — approximately 33 times the distance between Earth and Moon. The crew docked with the ISS on June 26 and conducted more than 60 experiments from 31 countries, including seven led by India’s ISRO.On Monday, at around 2.50 pm IST, the crew closed the hatch of their Dragon capsule, named Grace.By 4.45 pm, the spacecraft successfully undocked from the ISS. The capsule is now on a 22.5-hour return journey to Earth, carrying over 580 kg of cargo, including the scientific payload.Before the undocking, Shukla and mission commander Peggy Whitson were fully suited by 2.11 pm, while specialists Tibor Kapu and Slawosz Uznanski followed by 2.47 pm. NASA and SpaceX teams completed all safety checks, including leak tests and depressurisation, before issuing the undocking command.Grace performed its initial departure burns at 4.46 pm and 4.51 pm and is scheduled to carry out two more burns over the next 90 minutes to distance itself from the ISS and stabilise its orbit. The de-orbit burn is planned for 2.07 pm IST on Tuesday (July 15), with splashdown targeted for 3 pm off the coast of California.Axiom said ground teams are closely monitoring weather conditions — including wind speeds under 10 mph and the absence of rain or lightning — to ensure a safe recovery. Roughly 50 minutes after the de-orbit burn, the capsule will deploy drogue parachutes followed by the main ones for a controlled descent.Upon splashdown, recovery teams will board the capsule, conduct safety and medical checks, and airlift the astronauts for further health evaluations and debriefs.With this mission, Shukla joins the growing list of Indian-origin astronauts contributing to global space research — and now, to space humour as well.","Video shows Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla attempting to take group photos in microgravity.

Apprised President Xi of the recent development of our bilateral ties. Value the guidance of our leaders in that regard.”During his bilateral meeting with Wang Yi, Jaishankar said India and China had made “good progress” over the past nine months in normalising relations, attributing it to the resolution of friction along the border and the maintenance of peace and tranquillity. “This is the fundamental basis for mutual strategic trust and for smooth development of bilateral relations.It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,” he said.Jaishankar emphasised that both countries must continue to build on this positive momentum. “We have earlier agreed that differences should not become disputes, nor should competition ever become conflict,” he said. “Stable and constructive ties between India and China are not only to our benefit, but that of the world as well. This is best done by handling relations on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity. ”The minister also raised concerns about China’s export controls that could hurt domestic manufacturing in India. He urged Beijing to avoid “restrictive trade measures and roadblocks” and advocated steps to improve people-to-people ties, such as easing travel, resuming direct flights, and promoting exchanges. “Measures towards normalising our people-to-people exchanges can certainly foster mutually beneficial cooperation,” he said.During the SCO meeting, Jaishankar also reiterated India’s stance on terrorism, reminding Wang that the group’s primary mandate was to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism. “This is a shared concern and India hopes that zero tolerance for terrorism will be strongly upheld,” he stated, extending India’s support to China’s SCO presidency.He further stressed the need for cooperation on trans-border rivers, including the resumption of hydrological data sharing by China. He welcomed China’s decision to allow the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra to resume after a five-year pause, a move agreed upon earlier this year.The visit follows a significant turning point in October 2023, when India and China resolved the prolonged military standoff in eastern Ladakh, clearing the way for Prime Minister Modi and President Xi to meet in Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS summit. That meeting helped restart high-level diplomatic channels, with Modi expected to visit China in September for the SCO summit.","Jaishankar was in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting, where he also met his counterpart Wang Yi.

I-T department tapped many databases to identify likely offenders

NEW DELHI: The income tax department Monday launched a nationwide verification operation targeting individuals and entities facilitating fraudulent claims of deductions and exemptions in I-T returns.The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities but also those related to health insurance and medical expenses (Sec 80D and 80DDB of I-T Act), HRA (Sec 10(13A), interest on education and home loans and for purchase of vehicles (Sec 80E, 80EE and 80EEB), CBDT said.Those under lens are MNC staff, public sector companies, government bodies, academic institutions and entrepreneurs who have claimed deductions without valid justification, it said.The I-T department is now poised to take stern action against continued fraudulent claims, including penalties and prosecution wherever applicable. The ongoing verification exercise across 150 premises is expected to yield crucial evidence, including digital records, that will aid in dismantling networks behind these schemes and ensure accountability,"" the I-T dept said.This action follows a detailed analysis of ""misuse of tax benefits under I-T Act, 1961, often in collusion with professional intermediaries"", it said. It said that investigations have uncovered ""organised rackets"" operated by certain ITR preparers and intermediaries, who have been filing returns claiming fictitious deductions and exemptions. The move is a signal to individuals who take shortcuts and make claims without having evidence of deductions or expenses shown in returns.Tax authorities tapped multiple databases to identify likely offenders. It conducted search and seizures in several states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, and MP, where it found evidence of fraudulent claims.CBDT said the actions follow an outreach conducted programme, asking taxpayers to revise their returns in case discrepancies were noticed. ""As a result, around 40,000 taxpayers have updated their returns in last four months, voluntarily withdrawing false claims amounting to Rs 1,045 crore.

65 in-flight engine shutdowns reported since 2020: RTI data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/65-in-flight-engine-shutdowns-reported-since-2020-rti-data/articleshow/122471505.cms,"Air India crash

HYDERABAD: Sixty-five in-flight engine shutdowns in five years. Eleven ""Mayday"" distress calls from aircraft cockpits in 17 months, excluding the London-bound AI-171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 and a diverted domestic IndiGo flight.These numbers, obtained by TOI through a Right to Information (RTI) query to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), suggest a scary reality: engine malfunctions plague airlines operating in India at the rate of nearly one incident a month.Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's report mentioning fuel cut-off to engines of the crashed AI Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fits the broader pattern of technical failures being handled by experienced pilots, until one crops up that is unmanageable.DGCA data covers all engine shutdowns, including failures during take-off and mid-air. ""A total of 65 incidents related to in-flight shutdown of engines from 2020 to 2025 (till date) were reported across India,"" states the aviation regulator's RTI reply.In all 65 of these instances, pilots were able to safely manoeuvre aircraft to the nearest airport with a single, unaffected engine. Experts attribute engine shutdowns to technical issues ranging from low fuel to turbine malfunction and faulty electronic components.""Primary causes of engine shutdowns include blocked fuel filters, fuel contamination with water, interrupted fuel supply to engines, and foreign objects entering engine stack, all of which can halt flight operations,"" Capt C S Randhawa, president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told TOI.The RTI data shows that between Jan 1, 2024, and May 31, 2025, there were Mayday calls from 11 flights, reporting various technical glitches and seeking emergency landing. Besides AI-171, the list doesn't include a June 19 IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai that had to be redirected to Bengaluru due to congestion at the destination, only for the aircraft to report low fuel around 35km before landing.RTI data reveals that four of the 11 flights issued distress calls due to technical glitches and landed at Hyderabad.Airline Pilots' Association of India states that Mayday signals are exclusively used in life-threatening situations, distinguishing them from ""Pan Pan"" urgency alerts.""Flight crew initiate MAYDAY calls when confronted with critical emergencies such as aircraft fires, engine failures or situations posing imminent danger, necessitating immediate landing or grounding as continued flight becomes unsafe,"" said Anil Rao, secretary of ALPA India.AX Joseph, director of air safety at DGCA, said the aviation regulator was responsible for promulgating ""civil aviation requirements, circulars, aeronautical information circulars and public notices for compliance by the stakeholders to ensure safe operations"".While experts say that in-flight engine shutdowns and Mayday calls aren't uncommon across the world, India's position in global aviation safety standards may not be confidence-inspiring.

Toll may be halved for 2-lane national highways undergoing expansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toll-may-be-halved-for-2-lane-national-highways-undergoing-expansion/articleshow/122470281.cms,"File photo: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: In yet another move to rationalise tolling on national highways (NHs), the road transport ministry has proposed to halve the toll during the expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders to four-lane highways. This has been proposed since commuters don't get the desired service while construction work is underway on such stretches, with the highway width available for use being reduced.At present, the user fee for such stretches is 60 per cent of the normal toll for NHs, even during expansion phase, as they are narrow highways without dividers. If the proposal goes through and gets the green signal from the finance ministry, the user fee will go down to only 30 per cent of the normal toll during the construction phase.In the case of widening of four-lane highways to six lanes or expanding six-lane highways to eight lanes, the chargeable toll is capped at 75 per cent of the normal rate during the construction phase.This is also because commuters don't get the desired service while work is underway on such stretches. This has also been a major issue, with there even being instances of courts taking note of the anomaly.The proposal to give relief to commuters using two-lane NHs with paved shoulders gains importance considering road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has announced a plan to convert 25,000 km of two-lane highways into four-lane highways with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore in the next two years.The govt will be focusing over the next decade on the expansion of two-lane and two-lane with paved shoulders NH stretches, as nearly 80,000 km out of the total 1.46-lakh-km length of NHs fall under this category.Earlier, to provide relief to commuters, govt had announced the Rs-3,000 annual toll pass scheme, which will allow private vehicles to cross 200 toll plazas annually.More recently, it notified a new rule to reduce the toll rate by up to 50 per cent for structures such as bridges, tunnels, flyovers and elevated sections on highways, which will benefit commercial and heavy vehicles.","Road transport ministry has proposed to halve the toll during the expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders.

KOCHI: In a setback for the Kerala governor, the high court on Monday dismissed petitions challenging a single bench decision that declared 'illegal' the appointment of two temporary vice-chancellors for Kerala University of Digital Sciences Innovation and Technology and APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU), made without the recommendation of the state govt.A division bench of Justices Anil K Narendran and P V Balakrishnan rejected the appeals filed by the governor-cum-chancellor and temporary VCs of the digital university and KTU, Ciza Thomas and K Sivaprasad, respectively.Taking note of the prolonged administrative stalemate in both universities and its adverse impact on their functioning and students, the court urged the chancellor and the state government to act proactively and ensure regular appointments to the posts without further delay.The appeals primarily challenged the single bench's finding that appointments made without the government's recommendation are bad in law, citing that the university acts mandate such recommendation and limit the tenure of temporary VCs to six months.They also questioned the legality of these provisions, contending that they are inconsistent with the UGC Regulations. The bench, however, rejected this contention, holding that the UGC Regulations, 2010 and 2018, are silent on the appointment of temporary VCs.",HC urged the chancellor and the state government to ensure regular appointments to the posts without further delay.

PATNA: Bihar's 7.9 crore-strong electoral rolls could be purged of 35 lakh-odd voters after Election Commission's ongoing special intensive revision revealed that 2.2 per cent of electors have permanently shifted out of the state, almost 1.59 per cent have died, and 0.73 per cent are enrolled in more than one place.In an official status update on the exercise, which will continue till July 25, EC said Monday that booth-level officers had covered over 88 per cent of the electorate with 11 days to go for the revision to end.Unconfirmed reports on data verification through detailed enumeration forms suggest an unspecified number of illegal immigrants from Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar have infiltrated the rolls through identity fraud. RJD and other INDIA bloc constituents have questioned the veracity of these reports, while BJP insists that should be worrying only for the opposition.""After two rounds of door-to-door visits by BLOs, enumeration forms of 6.6 crore electors in Bihar have been collected...Only 11.82 per cent of electors now remain,"" EC said on Monday. The statement mentioned that electors could fill in enumeration forms online through the newly launched ECINet platform, and also look up their details in the 2003 electoral rolls.Over 5.74 crore forms had been uploaded till 6pm Monday, with the document review module of ECINet speeding up verification.An FIR was lodged against Gaurishankar, a government schoolteacher deployed for the special intensive revision of rolls in Manpur block of Wazirganj constituency, for allegedly taking bribes to fudge voter data. He could be suspended pending an inquiry, officials said.EC statement said many people had sought time to submit their enumeration forms with documents supporting their status as voters.""Nearly 1 lakh BLOs will soon begin their third round of door-to-door visits. Of the 1.5 lakh booth level agents appointed by all political parties, each can certify and submit up to 50 EFs a day.

NEW DELHI: In a major setback to over 1,000 assistant professors appointed in 2021 in Panjab University and Guru Nanak Dev University, the Supreme Court on Monday quashed their recruitment, observing that it was done in violation of UGC regulations.Recruitment was done for 1,091 posts of assistant professor and 67 posts of librarian. The court said it is a settled principle that when the law prescribes a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it should be done in that manner alone.""In the present case, there are multiple deficiencies. Giving away of a rigorous criteria laid down in UGC regulations with a single, multiple-choice question based written test, and the complete elimination of the viva-voce, all establish the arbitrary nature of the exercise which cannot pass the test of reasonableness laid down under Article 14 of the Constitution,"" a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandran said.""Hence, the single judge (of Punjab and Haryana HC) had rightly struck down the entire selection process, and the division bench of HC erred in interfering with that conclusion,"" it said. SC accepted the plea of senior advocates Raju Ramchandran and Nidhesh Gupta who alleged that the recruitment process was illegal and needed to be set aside.The court noted that the recruitment process was changed without any reason and it was decided by govt that selection would be done only on the basis of a written exam. ""State is entitled to change its policy, yet a sudden change without valid reasons will always be seen with suspicion.

NEW DELHI: As Parliament's monsoon session approaches, the stage seems to be getting set for a BJP-Congress duel over ""foreign interference"", with BJP MP Nishikant Dubey circulating documents about Jawaharlal Nehru govt's decision to let US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) install ""two nuclear-powered devices"" high in the Himalayas to monitor Chinese preparations for nuclear tests.In a post of X, Dubey attached a copy of an April 1978 letter from members of the US Congress addressed to the then US president Jimmy Carter. The letter expressed concern about a ""CIA operation"" in India in the 1960s, which the US foreign intelligence agency apparently carried out without keeping Indian government in the loop.The letter cited an 'Outside' article, published by Rolling Stone. According to author Howard Kohn there were ""two nuclear-powered monitoring devices"", allegedly for surveillance of Chinese atomic weapons testing, high in the Himalayas.The devices, containing plutonium, were placed on two mountains, one of which, Nanda Devi, is the source of India's Ganges River, the holy river for millions of Hindus, the letter stated. The then Congress government's decision to let CIA surveil on China's plans for nuclear tests has long been an open secret in many quarters. So was the unsuccessful effort to retrieve one of the monitoring devices, which was buried by an avalanche, by sending expeditions.But BJP's decision to ignite a fresh debate at this juncture is significant because of indications that Congress may double up on its allegation that US president Donald Trump coerced Modi government into agreeing to pause Operation Sindoor.Dubey linked Nehru government's decision and disapparance of the devices to natural calamities by citing the article which said the untraceable device could be ""leaking plutonium into the Ganges. If this is true, it would be a serious problem, indeed"".Sharing the letter, Dubey asked whether Kedarnath disaster, Teesta River flooding, melting glaciers in Gangotri and Yamunotri, and even decreasing water level of Ganga could be linked to this incident.""The Nehru-Gandhi family bowed before America. Rahul Gandhi ji, Congress is responsible for the destruction of farmers and played with India's faith...""

NEW DELHI: Union minister Amit Shah on Monday underscored the Modi government's vision of building a Viksit Bharat by 2047, outlining a five-point national resolve to guide India's progress in the coming decades.The five resolutions, as articulated by Shah, include achieving the goal of a fully developed India, fostering unity and solidarity across all sections of society, taking pride in India's cultural heritage, eradicating all remnants of colonial mindset in governance, culture, and institutions, and ensuring that every citizen contributes proactively to nation-building.Speaking at the 63rd Foundation Day celebrations of Bharat Vikas Parishad, Shah said that ""erasing the remnants of a colonial mindset and instilling a strong sense of duty among citizens"" will be central to realising India's aspirations as it approaches 100 years of independence.Shah also highlighted major steps taken by the Modi government over the last 11 years, saying they had brought about ""transformational changes in governance, security, and development."" Among the initiatives he cited were opening over 55 crore bank accounts for families without access to financial services, providing clean drinking water to 15 crore households, building 12 crore toilets, distributing 10 crore LPG connections, and giving 4 crore houses to the poor.On internal security, Shah pointed to abrogation of Article 370 as a landmark decision that integrated J&K and curbed terrorism. He emphasised the government's efforts in North-East, including Bodo Accord, Bru-Reang pact, and resolution of border disputes in Assam & Meghalaya, which he said had significantly reduced insurgency-related violence.""PM Modi has set before the country a vision that combines development with heritage.

NEW DELHI: Running against time to save the life of a nurse from Kerala, Nimisha Priya, whose death sentence is to be executed on July 16 in Yemen, government on Monday told Supreme Court that it was making all efforts to reach out to her but cannot do much because of the complex situation prevailing in the West Asian nation due to civil war.Appearing before a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta, attorney general R Venkataramani told the court that government had done what it could but there is a standstill. The area where the conflict is going on is not diplomatically recognised, limiting intervention, he said.""There's nothing much the government can do... It is not diplomatically recognised... There is a point till which government can go. We have reached that point. Yemen is not like any other part of the world.

It had said, ""Since we are relegating the petitioner to remedy of revision under Section 6 of Cinematograph Act, we direct that till the application for interim relief, if made by the petitioner along with the revision petition under Section 6, is decided by central govt, release of the film shall remain stayed.The film producer through advocate Pulkit Agarwal cited several SC judgements which had laid down the principle that a film cleared by censor board cannot be stalled from being screened in theatres unless there is an explicit violation which squarely fell within 'reasonable restrictions' on right to free speech specified under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.",Producers of the film 'Udaipur Files: Kanhaiya Lal Tailor Murder' have appealed to the Supreme Court for urgent hearing.

""The preliminary report identified no cause nor made any recommendations,"" he wrote Monday. ""I urge everyone to avoid drawing premature conclusions as the investigation is far from over.""Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's initial report concluded that ""all mandatory maintenance tasks had been completed"" and ""no mechanical or maintenance issues"" were detected.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday held that a private conversation between spouses, secretly recorded by one of them, is admissible as evidence in a matrimonial dispute and would not amount to breach of right to privacy Enumerating Section 122 of the Evidence Act, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said it dealt with the rule of privilege protecting disclosure of all communications between husband and wife during marriage except in litigation between them.It said, ""Under section 122, privileged communication between spouses is protected in the context of fostering intimate relationship. However, the exception under Section 122 has to be construed in light of right to a fair trial which is also an aspect of Article 21 of the Constitution."" ""When we weigh the respective rights of the parties in a trial within the parameters of Section 122 of the Evidence Act, we do not think that there is any breach of right to privacy in the instant case.In fact, Section 122 does not recognise such a right at all. On the other hand, the section carves out an exception to right to privacy between spouses, and therefore, cannot be applied horizontally at all,"" the bench said.In this regard, ""we reiterate that as per procedure established by law, Section 122 does not touch upon the aspect of right to privacy as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution, let alone invade upon such right. The reason is because Section 122 recognises the right to a fair trial, right to produce relevant evidence and a right to prove one's case against a spouse so as to avail the relief sought for by a party,"" it said.The section talks about communications during marriage and states that ""no person who is or has been married, shall be compelled to disclose any communication made to him during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married; nor shall he be permitted to disclose any such communication, unless the person who made it, or his representative in interest, consents, except in suits between married persons, or proceedings in which one married person is prosecuted for any crime committed against the other. ""SC made the observations on man's plea to bring privileged communication as evidence before a family court in matrimonial dispute. SC also said, ""Now, in today's day and age, when the technological advancement has made it easier to record and recreate moments of past and present for reference in future, then to say that such better forms of evidence and material would not be admissible on the ground of they being in violation of the right to privacy would amount to defeating the very object of the Evidence Act. That was the reason for Parliament to amend the Evidence Act by incorporating Section 65B which specifically deals with electronic evidence.""","A private conversation between spouses, secretly recorded by one of them, is admissible as evidence in a matrimonial dispute.

SC: Why can't citizens regulate themselves?

NEW DELHI: In two different cases, regarding ""objectionable"" posts on social media and sharing of a cartoon of PM Modi and RSS workers, Supreme Court on Monday expressed concern over abuse of fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression by citizens, particularly on social media.Such posts, it said, were causing hatred and increase in litigation and clogging of the criminal justice system. It asked people to show restraint on the medium.Hearing a plea of Wazahat Khan for clubbing of cases registered against him in different states for his objectionable posts against a Hindu deity on X, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan said citizens must know the value of fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression.In another case filed by cartoonist Hemant Malviya, a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Aravind Kumar strongly objected to objectionable cartoons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS workers on social media and said that right of freedom of speech and expression was being ""abused"".""If they want to enjoy fundamental right of speech and expression, it should be with the reasonable restrictions also. Apart from that, there must be self-restraint and regulation also, to enjoy the valuable freedom, not like this abuse.Article 19 is against the State, what you call it - verticality. What about horizontality?"" the bench observed in Khan's case.The court said Khan should have shown restraint in his remarks. It was Khan's complaint that had led to the arrest of influencer Sharmistha Panoli, whom he accused of posting derogatory content on Islam in relation to a post on Operation Sindoor.""One of the fundamental duties is to uphold unity and integrity of the country. So that is being violated. See all these divisive tendencies, at least on social media, must be curbed. But to what extent can the State curb? Instead, why can't the citizens themselves regulate themselves? Citizens must know the value of freedom of speech and expression.

Aviation Expert Links Mid-Air Fuel Cut-Off to AI171 Crash After AAIB Preliminary Report

Until final report is out, any speculation unacceptable: Union

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A day after Airline Pilots' Association of India said Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete, Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), one of the Air India pilots' unions, on Sunday slammed the ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" that has been doing the rounds since the report was made public on Saturday.AAIB had stated that both fuel switches on the Boeing 787 transitioned from ""run"" to ""cut-off"" three seconds after it took off from the runway, cutting off fuel supply to the engines. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other, 'Why did you cut off (the fuel supply)?' The other responded he did not do so,"" according to the report. However, it didn't elucidate why the fuel control switches were cut off.Soon after the report's release, pilots and aviation experts, in interviews and posts on social media, claimed one of the pilots had knowingly cut off the fuel supply switch.The pilots of AI 171, which crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions, ICPA, one of the AI pilots’ unions, said, adding the crew should not be vilified based on conjecture.Referring to a 2018 safety bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches — which could cut off fuel supply to the engines without pilot input — the report said that Air India did not carry out the inspection as it was not deemed mandatory.“In the aftermath of this incident, we are deeply disturbed by speculative narratives emerging in sections of the media and public discourse — particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide. Let us be unequivocally clear: there is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage, and invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible — it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved,” said ICPA.“Pilots undergo extensive psychological and professional screening, recurrent training, and operate under the highest standards of safety, responsibility, and mental fitness. To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it added.“As aviation professionals, we trust and respect the rigorous investigative protocols established by competent authorities. These inquiries are designed to uncover facts methodically and without bias. Until the official investigation is concluded and the final report is published, any speculation — especially of such a grave nature — is unacceptable and must be condemned,” ICPA said, calling on media and public commentators to act with restraint, empathy, and respect for due process.","Pilots' union slams ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122423964,imgsize-1785791,width-400,resizemode-4/122423964.jpg"

The initiative aims to target those exploiting people’s faith in Devbhoomi by defrauding them in the name of religion.According to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Singh, 23 individuals pretending to be saints and sadhus were arrested across various police station areas in Dehradun on Saturday. He confirmed that 10 of the arrested are residents of other states.Speaking to ANI, Singh said, “Under this campaign, the police took action in various police station areas on Saturday and arrested 23 fake babas roaming around in the guise of saints and sadhus. Among the arrested fake babas, 10 persons are residents of other states.”The CM instructed all station in-charges to identify such individuals and take firm action. Police say these fake seers often target women and young people, promising solutions to personal or domestic problems, only to defraud them.“In line with the instructions, all the station in-charges have been instructed to identify such persons in their respective police station areas, who disguise themselves as saints and mislead people, especially women and youth, and lure them to solve their personal or domestic problems and commit fraud with them, and take strict action against them,” Singh told ANI.Hindu religious bodies have welcomed the campaign, describing it as necessary to protect the sanctity of Sanatan Dharma.

The Pentagon has awarded contracts to several leading US artificial intelligence firms, including Elon Musk’s xAI, despite the company coming under fire recently for offensive content generated by its chatbot Grok.Announced on Monday, the contracts with xAI, Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI each carry a ceiling value of $200 million, according to the Pentagon’s chief digital and artificial intelligence office (CDAO).The awards aim to allow the department of defense “to leverage the technology and talent of US frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas,” the CDAO said in a statement, quoted by AFP.xAI’s inclusion follows renewed criticism of the company over Grok’s controversial responses, which surfaced after a July 7 update. The chatbot had praised Adolf Hitler, condemned “anti-white hate,” and claimed Jewish representation in Hollywood was “disproportionate.”xAI has since apologised and said it corrected the instructions that led to those outputs.The latest version, Grok 4, released on Wednesday, also drew scrutiny after appearing to mirror Elon Musk’s views in some of its responses.The contract award comes even asMusk remains locked in a public spat with US President Donald Trump. Though Musk had been a key supporter of Trump’s recent presidential campaign and was tasked with leading the cost-cutting agency Doge, he stepped down in May. He later criticised Trump’s major budget bill, accusing it of inflating government debt, prompting a series of heated public and social media exchanges. Musk eventually apologised for some of his more aggressive remarks.Despite the tension, the government and defence sector is being seen as a promising new frontier for AI firms.xAI, on Monday, announced the launch of its “Grok for Government” service, following a similar initiative from OpenAI. With its name now added to an official supplier list, xAI said all federal departments and agencies can now procure its products.Elsewhere, Meta has teamed up with defence start-up Anduril to develop virtual reality headsets for military and police use.OpenAI had already secured a Pentagon deal in June, also capped at $200 million.“Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities US industry has to offer,” the CDAO said.","Pentagon awards contracts to xAI, Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI.

India at growing risk of gastric cancer: New WHO study projects 1.6 million cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/india-at-growing-risk-of-gastric-cancer-new-who-study-projects-1-6-million-cases/articleshow/122380231.cms,"India and China could see 6.5 million gastric cancer cases combined

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser.

Former Google executive who raised $92 million for a startup backed by Sundar Pichai shares one simple strategy every entrepreneur should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-google-executive-who-raised-92-million-for-a-startup-backed-by-sundar-pichai-shares-one-simple-strategy-every-entrepreneur-should-know/articleshow/122399528.cms,"Former Google executive Caesar Sengupta finds startup life more chaotic than expected



How this one simple habit became Sengupta’s superpower



Why founders need mental clarity now more than ever



Inner stillness as the new startup strategy

In today’s high-octane startup world, where billion-dollar valuations can vanish overnight and hustle culture dominates, surviving the chaos requires more than grit, strategy, or even funding. According to Caesar Sengupta , co-founder and CEO of the digital wealth platform Arta Finance, and former Google Pay executive, entrepreneurs need something surprisingly simple yet profoundly powerful: stillness. Sengupta believes that daily meditation—not constant motion—is his ultimate superpower. And as neuroscience begins to validate this approach with compelling research, the message is clear: in the noisy, demanding world of startups, mental clarity, mindfulness, and emotional resilience might be the most underutilized, discover-worthy competitive edge for today’s ambitious entrepreneurs seeking sustainable success and peak performance.Before launching Arta Finance in 2021,a fintech company now backed by over $92 million in funding, including support from Sequoia Capital India and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Sengupta spent 15 years at Google. He helped build ChromeOS and co-founded Google Pay, which now serves more than 150 million users across 30+ countries.Despite his impressive resume, Sengupta admits the transition from corporate stability to startup chaos was mentally jarring. “There are days where you feel 100%, and there are days where you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what did I just do?’” he confessed. Startups, he explained, can consume founders entirely—damaging health, relationships, and emotional well-being.His solution wasn’t found in a productivity hack or another to-do list app. It was far simpler: five to ten minutes of meditation a day. “I wish three years back, somebody had sat me down and said: ‘Dude… just meditate,’” as reported by CNBC. That small window of silence became his daily anchor, offering mental space amidst a storm of decisions, investor meetings, and constant uncertainty.While Sengupta calls mindfulness his ""superpower,"" neuroscience is catching up to the claim. A recent study by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, reported by Neuroscience News, found that just 30 days of guided mindfulness meditation significantly enhanced focus and reduced distractibility across all age groups.Using eye-tracking technology, researchers observed improved reaction times and sustained attention—especially linked to changes in the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system, a brain center critical to focus, memory, and cognitive resilience. As postdoctoral researcher Andy Jeesu Kim put it, “Mindfulness isn’t just about feeling more relaxed — it can literally change the way your brain handles attention.”Founders today are under immense pressure navigating product launches, investor meetings, sleepless nights, and the ever-looming threat of failure. In such an environment, the ability to filter signals from noise isn’t just helpful, it's essential for survival.Sengupta also turns to cycling as a form of meditative movement. “It’s one of the only times where no one can reach me,” he says. This physical form of stillness helps him mentally recharge and stay grounded amid the chaos of building a high-stakes startup.As mindfulness gains ground in scientific and executive circles alike, Sengupta’s approach is emerging as more than just a personal quirk—it’s a strategic advantage. While others burn out chasing every opportunity, he’s choosing calm over chaos. And it’s working.“Ultimately,” he says, “it’s about how you confront the ups and downs of life.” For today’s entrepreneurs, Sengupta’s journey offers a profound lesson: in a world obsessed with speed, stillness may be your sharpest edge.","Caesar Sengupta is co-founder and CEO of the digital wealth platform Arta Finance.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

The mystery behind Bitcoin’s creator has once again captured global attention this time, not for innovation, but for wealth. The elusive individual or group behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, credited with launching the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008 and mining the first Bitcoin block in 2009, is now reportedly the 11th richest person on Earth.As reported by, Nakamoto’s estimated holdings of 1.096 million BTC are currently valued at a staggering $128.92 billion, placing them ahead of tech magnate Michael Dell, whose net worth stands at $124.8 billion according to. Despite these astronomical figures, the true identity of the Bitcoin founder remains unknown, continuing one of the greatest whodunits in tech and finance history.Since the rise of Bitcoin, many have speculated on the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. While names like Hal Finney (a cryptographic pioneer), Nick Szabo (a smart contract visionary), and even public figures like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey have been floated, all have denied any involvement in Bitcoin’s creation.One of the most controversial claims came from Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who repeatedly asserted he was Nakamoto. However, in 2024, the UK High Court ruled against Wright, convicting him of false claims and “legal terrorism.”He received a 12-month suspended prison sentence and was legally barred from continuing to claim authorship of Bitcoin.Despite several investigative efforts, Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity has never been confirmed. From tech forums to financial exposés, the pursuit to unmask Bitcoin’s founder has captivated journalists, cryptographers, and filmmakers alike. The 2024 HBO documentary “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,” directed by Cullen Hoback, added another layer to the intrigue. In the film, Hoback confronts cryptographer Peter K. Todd, who also denies being Nakamoto. The mystery remains unresolved.Records suggest that Nakamoto remained active online communicating through forums and emails until spring 2011, when all contact abruptly ceased. According to reports by the New York Post, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old man living in Japan, yet their activity patterns are more closely aligned with UK daylight hours.Experts also observed Nakamoto’s programming proficiency, particularly in C++, indicating a high level of technical expertise. In his book “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto: A Fifteen-Year Quest to Unmask the Secret Genius Behind Crypto,” journalist Benjamin Wallace described Satoshi as an “elusive figure who might or might not exist”, as reported byInitially, Nakamoto was just a quiet coder appealing to a fringe community of cypherpunks and technologists. But by 2022, Bitcoin had grown into the ninth most valuable asset globally, positioned just below Tesla and above Meta, signaling its explosive mainstream acceptance and Nakamoto’s financial ascent.Beyond wealth, Satoshi Nakamoto has become a symbol of decentralization and anonymity. In a striking homage, a bronze statue of a hooded Nakamoto was erected in Graphisoft Park, Budapest, in Hungary—celebrating a person whose face the world has never seen. “The statue represents a general human figure, since we do not know the gender, race, age, or height of the mysterious developer,” says StatueOfSatoshi.com. The polished bronze-aluminum face reflects the image of whoever stands in front of it, reinforcing the ‘We Are All Satoshi’ sentiment.This statue, created by sculptors Gergely Réka and Tamás Gilly, encapsulates the global and timeless appeal of Nakamoto’s vision, a financial system free from centralized control.Though their identity remains shrouded in secrecy, Satoshi Nakamoto’s legacy is undeniable. Bitcoin revolutionized digital finance, introduced the world to blockchain technology, and triggered an entirely new asset class—cryptocurrency. Today, as Nakamoto’s estimated $128.92 billion fortune continues to grow with Bitcoin’s value, the public remains captivated not just by the wealth, but by the enduring mystique of the invisible genius who started it all.Whether Nakamoto is a lone genius, a team of developers, or a pseudonymous ghost lost in history.","Satoshi Nakamoto is credited with launching the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008 and mining the first Bitcoin block in 2009.

Nvidia has secured a major breakthrough in China as the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, says that the Trump administration has granted approval for the tech giant to sell its advanced H20 artificial intelligence chips to Chinese buyers.Huang shared the news in a company blog post late Monday and also discussed the development in an interview with China’s state-run CGTN, excerpts of which were aired on X.“The US government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,” the blog said.“It's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,” he said, quoted by AP.“Today, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,” Huang told reporters in Beijing. He further highlighted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.Back in April, the White House had unveiled plans to restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips and AMD’s MI308 to China. Nvidia warned at the time that the export controls could cost the company an additional $5.5 billion.Huang, alongside other top tech executives, had been lobbying President Donald Trump to ease the restrictions. They argued the limits would blunt America’s competitive edge in a sector vital to the global economy and risked losing ground in one of the world’s largest tech markets.Huang’s comments come just ahead of his scheduled appearance at the opening ceremony of the 3rd China International Supply Chain Expo on Wednesday, according to Chinese state media. The expo appearance marks his third visit to China this year.Despite facing tougher competition from local players like Huawei, Nvidia remains committed to the market. On a previous visit to Beijing in April, Huang told Chinese vice premier He Lifeng that he saw strong potential in the Chinese economy and expressed his willingness to deepen Nvidia’s presence in the country.Back in May, Financial Times reported that Nvidia was planning to set up a research and development centre in Shanghai, though neither the company nor local authorities confirmed the report to AFP at the time.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the U.S. government has granted approval for the tech giant to sell its advanced H20 artificial intelligence chips to Chinese buyers.
