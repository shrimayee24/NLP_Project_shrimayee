'Threat to my life and that of my family': Abu Azmi calls Maharashtra assembly suspension arbitrary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threat-to-my-life-and-that-of-my-family-abu-azmi-calls-maharashtra-assembly-suspension-arbitrary/articleshow/118748395.cms,"Abu Azmi (ANI file photo)

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi , who has been suspended for the entire duration of the ongoing Maharashtra budget session over his remarks on Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, has called the decision arbitrary and raised concerns about threats to his life and family.Azmi took to social media platform X to express his concerns, saying, ""My suspension is arbitrary on the part of the government, there is a threat to my life and that of my family. Two laws are in force in Maharashtra, if democracy has ended in Maharashtra then the government can do anything to the public and the elected representatives of the public.""Earlier, Azmi had expressed his disappointment over the suspension and stated that he was willing to withdraw his remarks to ensure the smooth functioning of the Assembly.He said, ""To ensure that the House functions, I spoke about withdrawing my statement. I did not say anything wrong. Still, there is a controversy and proceedings of the House are being stalled. To ensure that the House functions and some work is done during Budget Session...I withdrew the statement that I made outside the Assembly, not in the House. Still, I have been suspended.""Azmi has received support from Samajwadi Party supremo and former Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav , who criticised the suspension as a violation of freedom of expression.""If the basis of suspension starts getting influenced by ideology, then what difference will there be between freedom of expression and subjection? Whether it is our MLAs or MPs, their fearless wisdom is unmatched. If some people think that by 'suspension' one can rein them in, then this is the childishness of their negative thinking,"" Yadav said.The suspension was announced by Maharashtra assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar on Wednesday following a proposal in the assembly against Azmi’s remarks on Aurangzeb. Parliamentary affairs minister Chandrakant Patil stated in the House that Azmi's ""objectionable statement"" had hurt the dignity of the assembly, leading to the decision.Azmi had reportedly said that Aurangzeb was not a ""cruel administrator"" and had ""built many temples."" He also claimed that the conflict between Aurangzeb and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was about governance and not religion.His comments sparked widespread outrage, particularly among Shiv Sena leaders and supporters, who have vowed to continue their protests across Maharashtra.Defending his remarks, Azmi later clarified that he had only repeated what historians and writers had documented about Aurangzeb. He stated that his comments were not intended to be against Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj or Sambhaji Maharaj and insisted that his ""words were twisted.""""My words have been twisted. I have said what historians and writers have said about Aurangzeb Rahmatullah Alaih. I have not made any derogatory comment about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Sambhaji Maharaj or any other great men - but still if anyone has been hurt by my statement, then I take back my words, my statement,"" he said in a video posted on X.Meanwhile, SP's ally and INDIA bloc partner, Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray criticised Azmi, saying, ""He should be permanently suspended. It should not just be for the Budget Session, the suspension should be permanent.""","Abu Azmi has been suspended for the entire duration of the ongoing Maharashtra budget session.

'True chauvinist and anti-nationals are Hindi zealots': Tamil Nadu CM Stalin's fresh attack on NEP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/true-chauvinist-and-anti-nationals-are-hindi-zealots-tamil-nadu-cm-stalins-fresh-attack-on-nep/articleshow/118747036.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing debate over the three-language policy in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has once again taken a strong stand against the BJP-led central government. On Thursday, he used a famous quote to target the Centre's stance on language policy, saying:""When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.""In his post on X, Stalin said that this quote reminded him of how some ""entitled bigots"" brand Tamil Nadu’s demand for linguistic equality as chauvinistic and anti-national. He accused BJP leaders of questioning the patriotism of the DMK government , despite its contributions to national causes, stating, ""The very people who glorify Godse’s ideology have the audacity to question the patriotism of DMK and its government that contributed the highest amount of funds during the Chinese Aggression, Bangladesh Liberation War, and Kargil War, while their ideological forefather is the one who assassinated 'Bapu' Gandhi.""Stalin continuing his attack on Centre, said that demanding linguistic equality should not be considered chauvinism, adding, ""Chauvinism is naming the three criminal laws that govern 140 crore citizens in a language that Tamils cannot even pronounce or comprehend by reading. Chauvinism is treating the state that contributes the most to the nation as second-class citizens and denying its fair share for refusing to swallow the poison called NEP.""He warned that forcing any language upon people creates enmity and weakens national unity. ""The true chauvinists and anti-nationals are the Hindi zealots who believe their entitlement is natural but our resistance is treason,"" he said.A day earlier, Stalin had also criticised the Centre, urging it to take meaningful steps to support the Tamil language rather than engaging in symbolic gestures. He questioned the BJP’s claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has great love for Tamil, arguing that such sentiments are not reflected in action. ""If the BJP's claim that our Hon'ble PM has great love for Tamil is true, why is it never reflected in action?"" he asked.He called on the government to consider concrete measures instead of symbolic acts, stating, ""Rather than installing Sengol in Parliament, uninstall Hindi from Union government offices in Tamil Nadu. Instead of hollow praise, make Tamil an official language on par with Hindi and allot more funds for Tamil than a dead language like Sanskrit.""In response, BJP Tamil Nadu chief K Annamalai questioned the DMK’s efforts in promoting Tamil beyond the state’s borders. ""What were your achievements in propagating our Tamil language beyond the borders of TN while in power in the State and the Centre? Did anyone obstruct DMK from doing it?"" he asked.He also pointed out that the Tamil Development Centre programme was launched by the previous AIADMK government and challenged Stalin’s role in expanding it. ""What efforts have you taken to roll out the Tamil Development Centre programme commenced by the previous AIADMK regime?"" he added.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has once again taken a strong stand against the BJP-led central government.

Fount of prosperity at Sangam? Boatman 'earned Rs 30 crore in 45 days of Maha Kumbh',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fount-of-prosperity-at-sangam-boatman-earned-rs-30-crore-in-45-days-of-maha-kumbh/articleshow/118746846.cms,"Pintu Mahara, his brother and mother Shuklavati Dev

PRAYAGRAJ: A wooden boat glided smoothly towards Sangam - the sacred confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and invisible Saraswati. Rhythmic chants of ""Har Har Gange"" blended with the gentle splash of oars. At the helm stood Pintu Mahara , guiding his passengers towards their spiritual rendezvous and his destiny toward prosperity.For Pintu and his kin, the 45-day Maha Kumbh was not just a gathering of millions - it was a tide of fortune that lifted their once-struggling family to uncharted heights.CM Yogi Adityanath recognised the boatman's success, sharing his story in the UP assembly on Tuesday and claiming the family's earnings touched Rs 30 crore. Pintu remained discreet about the figure but admitted it was an ""unprecedented"" windfall.It was no mere stroke of luck but the result of sharp business acumen honed over years. Recalling the bustling crowds of 2019 Kumbh, Pintu sensed the winds shifting and prepared to ride the crest of this spiritual wave. The boatman from Arail ghat made a bold and calculated gamble: he expanded his fleet from 60 to 130 boats. Each vessel, manned by a member of his extended family, ferried eager pilgrims across the holy waters.""Millions of devotees arrived in Arail, which resulted in a rise in our income,"" he said. A ride for 10 passengers, usually priced at Rs 6,000, soared to as much as Rs 30,000 during the peak of Kumbh.For Pintu's mother Shuklavati Devi, the change was nothing short of divine intervention. ""The family was in financial doldrums after the death of my husband. In such a situation, Maha Kumbh came as a saviour,"" she said.Pintu's success was not an isolated tale. More than 4,500 boatmen, many from nearby districts like Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Pratapgarh and Bhadohi, saw their earnings swell, turning their once-humble occupation into a thriving business.","The 45-day Maha Kumbh was not just a gathering of millions - it was a tide of fortune that lifted their once-struggling family to uncharted heights.CM Yogi Adityanath recognised the boatman's success, sharing his story in the UP assembly on Tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118746915,imgsize-975683,width-400,resizemode-4/118746915.jpg"
ED summons 11 deported from US for quizzing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-summons-11-deported-from-us-for-quizzing/articleshow/118746800.cms,"Photo/Agencies

CHANDIGARH: In a bid to zero in on travel agents involved in selling the 'American dream' to Indian residents and sending them to US through 'dunki' routes, ED on Tuesday sent summons to 11 illegal immigrants deported from the US recently.It has also initiated a probe under PMLA to trace the proceeds of crime.Well-placed sources told TOI that ED asked the 11 to appear at its office in Jalandhar on different dates, and ""at least one"" of the 11 was from Haryana, while the rest were from Punjab.According to preliminary data gathered by state officials after interviewing Punjab deportees at Amritsar airport, more than Rs 44 crore was paid to travel agents, with each person shelling out Rs 40 lakh-Rs 50 lakh on an average to reach the US illegally.A total of 131 deportees belonging to Punjab arrived in four batches after the Trump administration started mass deportation of ""illegal aliens"" soon after taking over on Jan 20.The sources said ED began the investigations by arranging details of the deportees ""on its own"".Of the 15 cases it initially analysed, it managed to get the ""details and addresses of 11 deportees"".Punjab Police have registered around two dozen FIRs on the complaints of the deportees, and ED has not yet officially sought any details from them, the sources said. The debriefing of deportees and the police complaints lodged by them point to a well-oiled network of agents who operate the 'dunki route' in a chain that involves touts and agents in several countries. This network makes the prospective illegal immigrants traverse through air routes, forests and rivers to reach Mexico, and then cross over to the US.The deportation flights to India started last month, with the first batch of 104 illegal immigrants, of which 31 were from Punjab, landing in Amritsar on Feb 5 on a US military plane. The second flight, which landed on the night of Feb 15, had 116 illegal immigrants, including 65 from Punjab. On the third flight that landed on Feb 16, 31 of the 112 deportees were from the state. The last batch of 12 deportees arrived on Feb 23 on a commercial Turkish Airlines flight originating from Panama. The flight landed in Delhi, and four from Punjab were part of this group."," ED has sent summons to 11 illegal immigrants deported from the US recently.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday took strong exception to the Uttarakhand govt spending compensatory afforestation funds and penalties paid for diversion of forest land, that were to be utilised for re-creation of forest, for purchase of laptops, iPhones, fridges and coolers, and sought the state govt's response within a fortnight.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar placed the CAG report on utilisation of the CAMPA funds before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran. The report said: ""At the divisional level, Rs 13.9 crore were diverted/expended on inadmissible activities like state scheme-Harella, tiger safari work, renovation of existing buildings, expenses on personage visits, court cases, purchases of iPhone, laptops, fridges, coolers, stationary, etc.""The bench said, ""Utilisation of huge funds from CAMPA for such inadmissible items and activities is a serious matter. We direct the chief secretary to file an affidavit by March 19 explaining how such huge funds were spent on such activities. If we do not get a satisfactory answer, we may require his personal presence in court on March 20.""Diversion of CAMPA funds to the tune of Rs 2.7 cr was made at Kalagarh Tiger Reserve for construction of internal path/six-metre-wide tiger safari road, modernisation of forest rest house, construction of forest guard chowkis and elephant protection wall, watch towers as well as removal of lantana. The CAG said, ""These activities were not permissible under Rule 5(4) of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund rules and conditions in the approved Annual Plan Operations by National Authority."" The CAG evaluates the effectiveness of CAMPA and implementing agencies during 2019-22 in implementing the Act and Rules made thereunder.The CAG also flagged the inequitable distribution of CAMPA funds. It said, ""The release of funds was unrealistic and not commensurate with the approved Annual Plan of Operations. The state authority failed to ensure equitable and need based funding of activities in all the implementing agencies.""""There was inefficiency/ineffectiveness in funds release, not adopting accounting procedures as per Compensatory Afforestation Fund rules and not discharging of interest liability. Besides, the state authority did not control the diversion/inadmissible expenditure from the state compensatory afforestation fund,"" it added.The CAG also noticed that the afforestation activities in the state have yielded low returns. ""The overall average survival percentage of plantations was 33.5% which is lower than the mandated 60 to 65%. In the test checked three divisions - Nainital, Pithoragarh and Rudraprayag, the survival rate at plantation sites was very low mainly because of non-suitability of the landscape or poor advance soil work before plantation,"" it said.","The Supreme Court took strong exception to the Uttarakhand govt spending compensatory afforestation funds.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday sought assistance of solicitor general Tushar Mehta in resolving the grievance of Indian Forest Service officers against their performance appraisal reports (PARs) being written by IAS officers as per the last June office order issued by Madhya Pradesh government.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran was dealing with a petition filed by Gaurav Bansal who has challenged the state's new mechanism for PAR of IFS officers that changed the PAR authority from divisional forest officers (DFOs) to Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF). IFS officers are objecting to their PARs being written by non-forest officers. Justice Gavai said IAS officers tend to boss over IFS officers and there is always a tussle between these two cadres. The IFS officers feel that the IAS officers do not know the intricacies of the forest conservation and wildlife protection steps taken by them and hence their performance appraisal by the IAS officers is bound to be error prone.""It should be resolved,"" the bench said. Mehta said he will deliberate on the issue and discuss with the stakeholders but hinted that the administrative hierarchy is well established and who would write which officer's PAR is provided for.The SC had earlier taken exception to the June 29, 2024, office order and warned that if it is not withdrawn then it may initiate contempt proceedings for issuance of the order in violation of the SC's orders.MP IFS Association had written a protest letter to CM Mohan Yadav highlighting the critical role played by forest service officials in wildlife and forest conservation and argued that the new PAR mechanism would demoralise these officers.The IAS officers supported the new mechanism saying four other biodiversity rich states - Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Rajasthan - have already implemented similar rules.",Supreme Court seeks assistance of solicitor general Tushar Mehta in resolving grievance of Indian Forest Service officers.

NEW DELHI: Actor-politician Kamal Haasan sharply rebuked the central government over Lok Sabha seats delimitation. He questioned the ""real motive"" behind the PM Modi-led government's move to skip census and dubbed it as the move to create ""Hindia"".""This arbitrary decision is part of that same pattern,"" he said at the the all-party meeting on Wednesday. Citing continuous delay in census, Haasan said, ""The real motive behind this is to consolidate power in Hindi-speaking states and ensure a decisive electoral victory.""""We envision an inclusive India, but they want to create 'Hindia.' Why try to fix something that isn't broken? There is no need to repeatedly disrupt a functioning democracy. No matter how constituencies are redrawn, the ones most affected will always be the non-Hindi-speaking states. This move undermines federalism and is entirely unnecessary,"" he said""Not just today, not just tomorrow, but at all times, keeping the number of parliamentary representatives unchanged is crucial to preserving democracy, federalism, and India's diversity. As an Indian, a Tamilian, and on behalf of Makkal Needhi Maiam, I strongly emphasize this,"" he added.Haasan condemned the Union government for overstepping into states' affairs, selectively allocating extra funds to poll-bound states while neglecting Tamil Nadu ’s fair share of resources. He also accused the Centre of using financial aid as leverage to enforce the Hindi language under the pretext of a ""three-language policy,"" pressuring state governments into compliance.He joined in Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin in opposing the Lok Sabha seats delimitation and said that if representation needed to be expanded, it should be at the state level, as all central government decisions are implemented by the states.Also read: 'Threat to federalism': Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin leads all-party pushback against population-based delimitation ""If at all, they have to increase the number of seats, all govt decisions made in the centre are executed by the states.

Karnataka may revive 4% Muslim quota proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-may-revive-4-muslim-quota-proposal/articleshow/118743514.cms,"Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah

BENGALURU: Karnataka government is set to reintroduce a proposal granting 4% quota for Muslim contractors in public civil works, nearly a year after dropping the idea amid controversy and allegations of appeasement politics.The move is seen as an effort by CM Siddaramaiah to consolidate support among Ahinda (a Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes, & Dalits) - a Congress vote base.The government is planning to amend Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements Act , 1999, in the assembly's current budget session to bring in the reservation. The finance department has prepared a blueprint, and law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil has reportedly given approval to the amendment.Karnataka reserves 24% of civil work contracts for SCs and STs, 4% for OBC category-1, and 15% for OBCs in category-2A. These reservations collectively account for 43% of the total contracts.If the proposed 4% Muslim quota is implemented under category-2B, overall reservation in govt contracts will increase to 47%, with ceiling being doubled to Rs 2 crore.During his first tenure as CM (2013-18), Siddaramaiah introduced reservation in govt contracts for SC/ST contractors. Earlier this year, two OBC categories were granted similar benefits. Communities like Besta, Uppara, and Dalit Christians fall under category-1, while Kurubas, Idigas, and over 100 other communities are part of category-2A. Siddaramaiah belongs to Kuruba community.Karnataka govt's push to expand reservations in public contracts has irked contractors from Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities, who do not receive such benefits.BJP has strongly opposed the move, calling it ""unconstitutional"" and an example of ""appeasement politics"". ""We oppose Congress govt's policy of dividing society based on religion,"" BJP state chief BY Vijayendra said. ""Congress sees only Muslims as minorities, ignoring other genuinely marginalised communities. Muslims already have reservations in education and employment, which goes against the Constitution. Now, granting them 4% reservation in govt contracts is the peak of appeasement politics.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday took a swipe at Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin over asking more fund for Tamil than ""dead language like Sanskrit.""In a post on X, BJP Tamil Nadu President K Annamalai questioned Stalin’s efforts to spread Tamil beyond the state and claimed that the Tamil Nadu CM deliberately despirtualised Thiruvalluvar to suit his propaganda.""Thiru @mkstalin, instead of listing what you have done to propagate our Tamil language beyond the confines of our State, knowing there aren't any, you've decided to move on to the next topic.

Poll What is most important in the justice system? Proper Investigation Fair Trial

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars.""

NEW DELHI: Another petition has been filed in Supreme Court challenging the validity of Places of Worship Act , alleging that the law is unconstitutional as it not only closes the doors of mediation but also takes away the power of the judiciary to adjudicate controversy over many disputed religious structures .Challenging validity of Section 4 of the Act which bars jurisdiction of court on declaration of the religious character of Places of Worship Act, the petition said it prevented judicial review which is one of the fundamental aspects of the Constitution and the prohibition undermines the authority of judiciary.""This provision not only closes the doors of mediation but also takes away the power of the judiciary. The legislature cannot take away the power of the judiciary to preside over disputes. This has been done through colourable legislation. If these matters are not fit to be in court, does the legislature have the power to decide so? Even to see whether the issue is fit to be raised in Court or not, it will have to go into the Court.

DEHRADUN: A motor bridge connecting Govindghat to Hemkund Sahib and the Valley of Flowers National Park collapsed due to a massive landslide on Wednesday. The landslide was triggered by boulders tumbling down the hillside near Govindghat in Chamoli.The bridge was located on the Badrinath National Highway , the main route for the 4km stretch from Govindghat to Pulna village. From there, visitors are required to trek to Hemkund Sahib, a popular shrine of the Sikh community, and the Valley of Flowers, a Unesco World Heritage Site. Both the sites are currently snow-bound and not accessed by visitors.An official said multiple villages in the area which are inhabited in the winter months, including Pulna and Bhyundar, were cut off from the district headquarters after the bridge collapsed and several vehicles were stranded across the Alaknanda river.""The landslide struck in the morning. Connectivity to a few villages has been disrupted, and our top priority is ensuring there is no shortage of essential supplies,"" said Chamoli district magistrate (DM) Sandeep Tewari.He added that officials from the public works department (PWD) were sent to assess the damage and propose urgent measures to restore connectivity.

""Three died in the district hospital due to age-related ailments and the causes of the other two are being ascertained. The main reason, our health teams have found, is the change in weather, coinciding with mahua harvest time, when villagers go into the forests and collect mahua the whole day. This is leading to dehydration and they are falling sick,"" he said. Kashyap said villagers are given ORS as they are adamant on going to forest to gather mahua.","A mysterious illness has claimed 13 lives within a month in a remote village in insurgency-hit Sukma district of Chhattisgarh.

On Wednesday, the bench neither had an affidavit from the state nor the state's counsel present to explain the implementation of its Feb 20 order. Finding another counsel, Vanshaja Shukla, who also appears for the state, the bench asked her about the lapse.As she was persuading the court for adjournment to get proper instructions from the Uttarakhand chief secretary, another counsel A K Sharma appeared through video-conference and nonchalantly told the court that since the state was given time to file an affidavit by March 5, it would be doing so today itself.When the bench asked whether ESZs have been notified around the Corbett and Rajaji national parks, the counsel said the state is seeking time to notify them.

Poll What’s the Best Way to Tackle Smuggling? Tougher Legal Actions Enhanced Border & Airport Checks

BENGALURU: Sandalwood actor Ranya Rao , daughter of director general of police (Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, was arrested by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Monday night, on charges of gold smuggling .Ranya, who had arrived from Dubai , was caught with 14kg of gold bars concealed in a belt strapped to her body, along with 800grams of gold ornaments. She was produced before a judge on Tuesday evening and remanded to 14-day judicial custody. Investigators suspect she is part of a gold smuggling racket that has been actively operating through Bengaluru airport for the past few months.The 32-year-old actress has acted in a few Kannada movies including the Sudeep-starrer Maanikya and Ganesh-starrer Pataki, as well as the Tamil movie Wagah starring Vikram Prabhu.According to sources, Ranya came under DRI's radar due to her frequent foreign trips - reportedly making over 10 trips since the beginning of the year. ""Officials got suspicious and started tracking her multiple short trips to the Gulf,"" an officer posted at KIA said.When she boarded an Emirates flight from Dubai to Bengaluru on Monday, a DRI team was dispatched to intercept her upon arrival. It was shocking to see how she had concealed the gold bars in the belt. She looked very confident when she disembarked and didn't raise any suspicion,"" the source said.The four-member DRI team is reviewing footage of Ranya's recent arrivals in the city. ""In the four previous trips in 15 days, she was dressed similarly, with the belt hidden from view,"" the source said. The DRI is trying to determine whether she smuggled gold on all these occasions and the total quantity brought in.Sources said she evaded detection taking advantage of official protocol services typically used by senior bureaucrats, including IPS officers. ""A protocol officer would meet her at the terminal and escort her out of the building. While her baggage was subject to random and routine checks, she was never physically frisked as she was accompanied by the protocol officer. In fact, a govt vehicle would even pick her up from the airport, ensuring there is no trouble en route home,"" the source explained.When contacted, DGP K Ramachandra Rao distanced himself from his daughter's activities. ""Four months ago Ranya married Jatin Hukkeri (an architect specializing in designing interior spaces for upscale pubs and microbreweries in the city). She hasn't visited us since the wedding. We're completely unaware of her or her husband's business dealings. This has come as a huge shock and disappointment. She has let us down. If there is any violation, the law will take its course,"" Rao told TOI.In 2014, when Rao was IGP (Southern Range), Mysuru police came under scrutiny when a Kerala-based jeweller accused them of pocketing Rs 2 crore. On Jan 4 that year, a police team intercepted a private bus at Mysuru border and seized Rs 2.2 crore in cash being transported to Kerala. However, when registering the case, cops declared only Rs 20 lakh as the unaccounted money. The CID later investigated the case and arrested Rao's gunman for dacoity.","Sandalwood actor Ranya Rao was arrested by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Monday night.

JAMMU: Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, on Tuesday said his govt will develop and publicize tourism hotspots to attract Vaishno Devi pilgrims to Jammu and nearby locations, reaffirming their commitment to boost the region’s economy.Responding to a supplementary query by Yudhvir Sethi, MLA, in the assembly, the CM, who also holds charge of the tourism department, said concerted efforts are being made to publicize every tourism asset in the region.“The department is actively working on developing the Jammu pilgrimage circuit. I have repeatedly emphasized this to more than 1 crore Mata Vaishno Devi pilgrims.

We will ensure widespread distribution of promotional literature at trade and tourism fairs to attract visitors,” he said.“Developing tourism destinations alone is not enough. Sites like Jammu’s heritage landmarks, the forthcoming Jammu lake and the Jammu zoo are significant attractions, but they need better branding and visibility,” he said, adding, “We must give these destinations distinct identity and promote them effectively.

Boston Bruins Eyeing Bigger Return from Flames at NHL Trade Deadline Amid Brandon Carlo Speculations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/boston-bruins-eyeing-bigger-return-from-flames-at-nhl-trade-deadline-amid-brandon-carlo-speculations/articleshow/118737459.cms,"Image Via Getty Images

A Brandon Carlo To Flames Deal Could Create A Bigger Opportunity

With the NHL trade deadline approaching, the Boston Bruins have been in the limelight with their recent activities. Just after the Bruins traded Trent Frederic and Max Jones to the Edmonton Oilers for draft picks and prospect Max Wanner, they would surely be eyeing a bigger fish. With Carlo supposedly on the radar of the Calgary Flames, Boston could set itself for a much larger return that would greatly benefit the roster into the future. This retooling type of move indicates that the team plans to enhance its roster without slowing down its long-term goals.Brandon Carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation, especially with two years remaining on his contract with a very manageable cap hit of $4.1 million. The 27-year-old American defenseman has been a steady presence on the Bruins' blue line, making him a tempting sweetener in a deal for teams seeking defensive stability. With strong interest reportedly being expressed by the Calgary Flames to acquire Carlo, this may lead to quite a larger return relative to Frederic's worth.With several teams still in the hunt for the playoffs, this year's trade market is definitely on the side of the sellers. Boston's recent dealings with the Oilers, which saw them acquire two draft picks and a promising prospect, indicate that teams are ready to pay well for valuable assets. Should the Bruins act upon that market trend and trade Carlo, he could attract high picks and prospects that could greatly bolster the franchise's efforts in the offseason.With the Flames looking to shore up their back end with an eye toward the playoffs, the Bruins would have all the more leverage in trading Carlo. Such a deal fits neatly into Boston's short-term retooling plan while preserving guys like David Pastrnak, Brad Marchand, and Charlie McAvoy for greater glory in the future.Also Read: NHL fans express concern as Brad Marchand takes devastating hit during Bruins vs Penguins showdown The Bruins are using a calculated strategy for the day of the trade, balancing short-term goals and long-term projects. A trade of Brandon Carlo could bring the package of picks and prospects valuable to their offseason roster upgrade. There will be no total rebuild; instead, the Bruins are positioning themselves strategically to retool and be competitive. With many building blocks already in place, Boston's front office will wisely prioritize the accumulation of assets to set the stage for sustained success. Just before the deadline, the fans can expect the Bruins to make a series of calculated moves that favor their present as well as future.","Brandon Carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation, especially with two years remaining on his contract.

Texas tornado hits home; Erin Bradshaw mourns heartbreaking loss



The Truth About Terry Bradshaw's Daughters Revealed

Tornado warning strikes. But where is Terry Bradshaw?



As severe storms and tornado warnings grip North Texas, concerns rise for residents—including Terry Bradshaw ’s family. While the NFL legend sold his ranch and reportedly moved into a smaller Texas home, recent sightings suggest he might not even be in the state. With Mansfield, Burleson, and Rendo under a tornado watch, fans are left wondering; where is Bradshaw amid the chaos, and is his family safe?Texas is no stranger to tornadoes. In 2020, NWS meteorologist Tom Bradshaw noted the state sees around 150 annually. Five years later, a powerful storm is once again wreaking havoc, and this time, it has hit close to home for Terry Bradshaw’s daughter, Erin.The world-champion equestrian took to Instagram, sharing heartbreaking images of the destruction on her property. “It got a little western at 5 a.m. here,” she wrote.“It got a little western at 5 am here. Two of our loafing sheds got tossed like golf balls. Sadly one loafing shed was in our mare and baby pasture. We lost one baby and have one mare with a severe cut to her back leg that is due any day with her baby at the vet clinic.”Born and raised in Texas, Erin experienced the chaos firsthand. While the storm’s impact was mild compared to major disasters, the damage was deeply personal.“Not what anyone wants to wake up too and we are heartbroken to lose a baby but things could have been worse. I’m glad our home is okay.

James Harrison's final days



Australian Blood Donor James Harrison Dies at 88: Learn about his childhood, his high-quality blood and why he became ""The Man with the Golden Arm"". James Harrison, or the ""Man with the Golden Arm"" as he was popularly known, died at 88 years old, leaving behind a legacy of philanthropy and medical history that saved thousands of lives. Not only is he most famous for his record-breaking donations of blood, but he is also the man who contributed to the creation of a life-saving treatment that saved millions of babies worldwide as per reports.James Harrison's amazing tale began when he was young at the age of 14. His complex lung operation then required multiple blood transfusions if he was to survive. Harrison's first introduction to blood donation made a deep impression on him and forged an affinity with volunteering that he cherished for the rest of his life. At age 18, motivated by his father, Harrison gave his first blood donation, an act which would lead into more than half a century of volunteering.For an incredible 60 years, Harrison never missed an opportunity to give blood. In his lifetime, he gave plasma 1,173 times, his unwavering commitment to saving lives. He continued to donate until he retired in 2018 at the age of 81, a tribute to his sustained devotion to saving lives.It was the presence of the rare and precious Anti-D antibody in Harrison's plasma that made his blood so special. This antibody has been instrumental in finding a cure for Haemolytic Disease of the Foetus and Newborn (HDFN), a life-threatening condition that could strike babies born to Rh-negative mothers. Harrison's blood donations, which held this special antibody, have been responsible for saving the lives of more than two million babies globally. His donations have had a lasting and widespread impact on medical science, particularly in the field of maternal and child health.In spite of the scale of his success, Harrison was humble all his life. He never felt that any blood donor played a more significant role than him in saving lives and never wanted any special praise for his contributions. Even at times of personal hardship, such as the death of his wife Barbara, who was a committed blood donor herself, Harrison was committed to his cause of helping others.According to BBC reports, Harrison's daughter, Tracey Mellowship, reported that her father wasn't only a humanitarian but also a great father and grandfather with a witty sense of humor. Tracey has a very personal connection to his efforts—she herself was an Anti-D recipient, and her very existence was made possible because of his efforts.James Harrison's death has created a profound void in his family and the medical fraternity. Tributes have flowed in from all over the globe, with Australian blood donation groups declaring him an icon of kindness, selflessness, and commitment to saving lives. His legacy continues to motivate generations of blood donors to come, and his hope was always that someone would eventually break his record.Although Harrison has passed away, his lifesaving legacy remains. Researchers from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI), in association with Lifeblood, are currently engaged in a groundbreaking project titled ""James in a Jar"". The project seeks to recreate the Anti-D antibody through samples of Harrison's blood to make mass production of the life-saving antibody possible. The idea is to further the availability of the treatment past Australia and save tens of thousands of lives globally, advancing Harrison's own legacy in eliminating HDFN.James Harrison died peacefully in his sleep on February 17, 2025, at Peninsula Village Nursing Home. The unassuming Junee, Australian man's life was characterized by his commitment to saving others' lives. His remarkable efforts left an indelible mark in the world, and though he is no more, his contribution continues to form the future of blood donation and medical research.Harrison's legacy will endure in the lives of those whose lives were saved through his plasma, ongoing research prompted by his generosity, and the generations of individuals who, moved by his example, will donate blood to save others.","Australian blood donor James Harrison has died at the age of 88.

Taylor Swift urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate

Taylor Swift is reportedly coming under more pressure to keep her personal life separate from her professional image. Some, according to insiders, think that her very public romance with Travis Kelce might be having a detrimental impact on her reputation. The debate was heightened after she received boos at the Super Bowl—a moment that some waved off as friendly ribbing, while others interpreted it as a sign that her involvement in the NFL universe isn't welcomed by everyone.Taylor Swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate. Sources claim that certain advisers of hers are of the view that her celebrity romance with Travis Kelce might be damaging her carefully crafted persona.Disapproval mounted after she was booed at the Super Bowl, but others interpreted as definitive proof that her growing presence within the NFL community isn't for everyone. Since Swift is arguably one of the most powerful entities in the music industry, a few insiders fret that her visibility with the world of sports would bring unnecessary turmoil to her profession.At the same time, Travis Kelce is also receiving flak, especially from fans of the Kansas City Chiefs questioning if his priorities on football have been diluted. His disappointing outing in the last game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles only added fuel to the fire, with some of them positing that his life outside the football field, including his relationship with Taylor Swift, might be affecting his performance.Once regarded as an untouchable leader on the field, Travis Kelce is now under scrutiny for possibly letting distractions interfere with his play. Since the couple continues to be in the spotlight, both Swift and Kelce find themselves at the center of discussions regarding whether their romanceTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce, formerly the epitome of power couples connecting music and sport, now face a reversal of public perception that could be hard to discount. Rumors of a possible wedding later in the year only served to heighten debate, with some industry sources warning that cross-pollinating their brands to such an extent might prove to have unforeseen effects. With the couple's relationship making up-page news every day, the test is to keep their romance alive while keeping their respective careers intact.“This whole situation is creating a weird tension between her and Travis, especially since this is their first real bump in the road,” a source told Radar Online. “Until now, it’s been nothing but good times!

Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/donald-trumps-tariffs-india-may-be-among-least-vulnerable-asian-economies-in-trade-war-with-us-but-theres-a-catch/articleshow/118733998.cms,"Donald Trump has criticised India and other nations, including China, for their ""very unfair"" tariff practices.

As is evident from the chart, India’s exports to the US as a percentage of the former’s GDP is just 2.2%, compared to 25.1% for Vietnam, hence indicating relatively lesser exposure.

Which countries are more vulnerable to US tariffs?

What Donald Trump has said:

Trade Relations between Asia and United States

Vietnamese shipments to the United States constitute 25% of its GDP, primarily comprising textiles and electronic goods.

Electronics make up over 60% of both Taiwanese and Malaysian exports to the United States.

Thailand faces broader vulnerability across electronics, rubber-based products and machinery exports.

Other Asian nations show varied export portfolios to the US market. Singapore sends approximately 14% in chemicals and pharmaceutical products, whilst India's primary exports include precious stones, textiles and pharmaceutical items.

What Trump’s Tariffs may mean for Asia

1. Regional Effect:

Amongst the top 11 nations with US trade deficits, seven are Asian: China (1), Vietnam (3), Taiwan (6), Japan (7), South Korea (8), India (10) and Thailand (11).

US' goods trade balances

2. Reciprocal Tariffs:

3. Sector-specific Duties:

4. Semiconductor tariffs:

5. Third country risk:

Since India’s share of China value added in their goods exports to the US is relatively less, there is lower expected impact.

6. Indirect effects:

Role of Reciprocal Tariffs

Asian developing economies, particularly India and Thailand, apply elevated comparative tariff rates on American exports, making them vulnerable to increased reciprocal tariffs.

Asian countries' tariffs on the US minus US tariffs on Asian countries

How India is prepping for Trump 2.0

According to the Nomura report, India intends to secure a comprehensive trade and investment agreement with the United States, as India stands ready to reduce tariffs on select items (e.g. pork, high-end medical devices, luxury motorcycles) and extend substantial benefits including production-linked incentives for shipping and backing for logistics enterprises.

India seeks to enhance procurement of defence equipment, aircraft, oil & gas, technology and medical & diagnostic equipment from the United States.

The aim is to position India as a viable manufacturing alternative to China, offering enhanced benefits such as tax reductions and land accessibility in states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu across sectors including semiconductors, electronics, aircraft components, and renewables.

India aims to become part of US global supply networks by providing concessions to American companies utilising India as a production centre for basic/intermediate goods (e.g. low-end chips, solar panels, machinery, pharmaceuticals).

India proposes to increase foreign direct investment limit in insurance to 100% (currently at 74%), potentially benefiting major US insurance companies like AIG.

Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impact on India: US President Donald Trump has announced that on April 2, 2025, America would impose reciprocal tariffs on countries that levy higher duties on American goods. During his address to Congress, Trump criticised India and other nations, including China, for their ""very unfair"" tariff practices.So what will be the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India? According to a recent report by Nomura, India is among the least vulnerable Asian countries in this trade war.Also read: Trump again rails at India over tariffs, announcing reciprocal duties from April 2 The economies of Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia, which maintain comparatively unrestricted trade policies, face significant vulnerability to increased US customs duties. Among Asian nations, Vietnam stands particularly susceptible, as its US-bound exports constitute 25% of its gross domestic product.Analysis of Asia's value addition in global exports to the United States by Nomura reveals Vietnam as the most vulnerable to comprehensive US tariffs (8.9% of its GDP). This is followed by Taiwan (6.3%), Thailand (5.6%), Malaysia (4.6%), Singapore (4.5%) and South Korea (4.5%). The computer & electronics industry faces the highest risk from supply-chain disruptions caused by tariffs.Trump's proposed tariff measures include various sectors including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminium, lumber and forest products, with copper potentially being added to the list.The impact on Asian exports to the United States is substantial, with 20.6% of the region's US-bound shipments facing potential disruption. Several Asian economies show significant vulnerability, as more than 25% of US-directed exports from South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan could face these sectoral tariffs.In terms of sectoral analysis, Asian economies demonstrate highest exposure to automotive tariffs, whilst semiconductor and steel sectors rank as the second and third most vulnerable areas respectively.""Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, - Mexico and Canada - Have you heard of them - and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair,"" Trump stated in his longest speech to the Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday evening.He specifically highlighted that ""India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 per cent.""The implementation of increased tariffs on Indian exports (including pharmaceuticals, textiles, and IT services) would increase their costs in the US market, potentially reducing demand. This could negatively impact Indian manufacturers and exporters whilst increasing prices for US consumers.As a counter-measure to US tariffs, India might seek to enhance its economic relationships with alternative global partners such as the European Union, China, or Russia to offset reduced US market access. This development could diminish American economic influence.Analysing sector-wise exposure, electronic components, machinery, automobiles and other manufactured items face elevated US customs duties.China stands as the primary focus of America First Trade Policy (AFTP), whilst other Asian nations face significant risks. The US tariff strategy encompasses trade deficits, reciprocal and sectoral duties, alongside potential penalties for nations involved in tariff evasion. Regarding trade imbalances, Asia maintains a substantial surplus with the US.The implementation of reciprocal tariffs considers tariff differentials, VAT and non-tariff obstacles. Developing Asian nations, particularly India and Thailand, maintain higher comparative tariff rates on US exports, notably in agricultural and transport sectors. Including non-tariff barriers in assessment criteria increases the possibility of reciprocal taxation across various Asian economies, both emerging and developed.The proposed tariffs target semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminium, lumber and forest products (potentially copper), comprising 20.6% of Asian exports to the US. For Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan, these sectoral tariffs could affect over 25% of their US exports. Asian exposure is highest in automobiles, followed by semiconductors and steel.Detailed analysis indicates minimal direct consequences of increased chip tariffs on Asia, considering limited US substitution options. However, indirect effects present greater concerns, as reduced US consumer demand would affect Asian economies across various electronics supply chain stages. Taiwan shows the highest vulnerability, followed by Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.Should the US administration implement tariffs on imports from countries potentially circumventing existing duties, specific products from Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand could face scrutiny, as these nations show higher Chinese value addition in their US-bound exports.Asian nations are deeply integrated into global supply networks, encompassing both backward linkages (where foreign value is incorporated into domestic exports) and forward linkages (where domestic value is incorporated into foreign exports). As a result, Asia's actual exposure to the United States - considering both direct and indirect value addition through third countries - is substantially higher.Retaliatory or reciprocal tariffs shall be determined by considering multiple elements including tariff differentials, value-added tax and non-tariff restrictions.Across industries, Asian nations levy steeper duties on farm products and transport items. Whilst reducing agricultural tariffs remains politically challenging for Asian countries, they could consider lowering duties in the transport sector, including automobiles.","US President Donald Trump has announced that on April 2, 2025, America would impose reciprocal tariffs on countries that levy higher duties on American goods. During his address to Congress, Trump criticised India and other nations, including China, for their ""very unfair"" tariff practices.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
Elon Musk meets Republican senators to explore turning DOGE budget cuts into law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-meets-republican-senators-to-explore-turning-doge-budget-cuts-into-law/articleshow/118747805.cms,"Elon Musk leaves after meeting with Senate Republicans, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. (AP Photo )

Billionaire Elon Musk visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a meeting with Republican senators , where he was introduced to budget rescissions—an obscure legislative tool that could help formalise his aggressive federal budget-cutting efforts. The meeting took place just hours after the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration’s attempt to freeze $2 billion in foreign aid funds.During the lunch gathering, senators explained how the White House could package the billions in savings Musk has identified into a budget rescissions proposal and send it to Congress for a vote. The idea appeared to excite Musk.""He was so happy,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . ""He didn't know.""The discussion marked a potential next step for Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, as Republicans look to solidify the spending cuts and counter legal challenges. The Trump administration is currently battling in courts and public opinion over its cost-cutting measures, which have led to mass layoffs of federal workers.Republicans are eager to frame DOGE's actions as more than just widespread job losses, instead portraying them as an effort to curb waste, fraud, and inefficiency in government spending. The administration is also seeking ways to navigate legal hurdles, as courts have shown skepticism toward its budget-cutting methods.Despite enthusiasm for budget reductions, some senators acknowledged concerns over how the cuts are being implemented. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., noted that lawmakers are looking for ""just better communication, wanting to know what's going to happen next."" However, he admitted that even the White House might not have clear answers, adding, ""I don't know that anyone at the White House knows what's going to happen next.""Senate Majority Leader John Thune joked that Musk may have underestimated the flood of inquiries from lawmakers after sharing his personal cellphone number. ""I thought, OK, his phone's going to start blowing up,"" Thune said on Fox News. ""He might want to change his number."" To manage communication, Musk aide Katie Miller is expected to set up a direct line for senators to raise questions about the cuts.Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky., was the one to introduce the idea of rescissions during the meeting, emphasizing the need for a formalized approach to make the budget cuts permanent.""I love what Elon is doing. I love the cutting into waste. I love finding all the crazy crap that we're spending overseas,"" Paul said. ""But to make it real, to make it go beyond the moment of the day, it needs to come back in the form of a rescission package.""Paul, a staunch fiscal conservative, suggested multiple rescission packages totaling at least $100 billion in federal cuts. He also advised Musk to abandon the administration’s approach of using impoundments to withhold funds, given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling. ""My message to Elon was, let's get over the impoundment idea and let's send it back as a rescission.""While rescission packages could pass the Senate with a simple majority vote, bypassing a Democratic filibuster, the process faces political obstacles. Senators on the Appropriations Committee may resist cuts that override previously approved funding, and lawmakers representing key constituencies may push to protect federal programs tied to their home states. Even within the Republican Party, achieving unity on such votes could prove difficult.Despite these challenges, Graham framed the initiative as a way for the White House to regain control of the budget debate. ""We're losing altitude,"" he said. ""We need to get back in the game, on offense, and the way you can regain altitude is to take the work product—get away from the personalities and the drama—take the work product and vote on it.""Notably absent from much of the discussion was the impact of DOGE’s cuts on federal workers who have lost their jobs. Paul acknowledged the difficulty of transitions but emphasized that the focus should be on eliminating waste.""Any time there's a transition, it's difficult,"" he said. However, he added that some lawmakers raised concerns to ensure ""we're not just getting rid of people that we actually need, and that we are not overdoing it.""Musk has previously estimated that DOGE could generate $1 trillion in savings for the federal government this year alone. While the path to turning those cuts into law remains uncertain, Tuesday’s meeting signaled an important step in the effort to formalize his budget-slashing agenda.","Billionaire Elon Musk met with Republican senators on Tuesday to discuss his budget-cutting efforts.
