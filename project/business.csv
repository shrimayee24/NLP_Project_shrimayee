Kashi Tamil Sangamam 4.0: 300 Varanasi Students To Visit Tamil Nadu As Centre Expands Tamil Outreach

NEW DELHI: Even as the Centre and the DMK-led Tamil Nadu govt continue to spar over education-related issues, the fourth edition of Kashi Tamil Sangamam (KTS) marks a significant expansion of the Union govt's Tamil language outreach with two major initiatives - sending 300 college students from Varanasi to Tamil Nadu for immersive Tamil learning and bringing 50 Tamil teachers to Varanasi schools to teach spoken Tamil.Officials maintain that the push remains culturally anchored and aimed at strengthening India's linguistic traditions.KTS 4.0 will open at NaMo Ghat on Dec 2, coinciding with Karthigai Deepam on Dec 4. More than 1,500 delegates from Tamil Nadu will participate in an eight-day programme featuring knowledge-sharing sessions, cultural events and heritage visits to Kashi Vishwanath temple, BHU, Sarnath, Hanuman Ghat and Ayodhya temple. The theme - ""Let Us Learn Tamil or Tamil Karkalam"" - reinforces the idea of Indian languages as part of a shared civilisational fabric.What makes this year's edition notable is the Centre's scaling-up of Tamil-learning programmes at a time when its relationship with Tamil Nadu govt remains strained over NEET, the three-language policy and centralisation of education regulation. Officials say the reciprocal model - Tamil teachers in Uttar Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh students in Tamil Nadu - is intended to deepen ""people-to-people connections."" Under the Tamil Karkalam campaign, 50 teachers from Tamil Nadu will begin spoken Tamil classes across 50 Varanasi schools from Dec 2 to Dec 15, reaching 1,500 students.The inaugural batches arrive on Dec 1.In return, 300 college students from Varanasi will travel in 10 batches to Tamil Nadu between Dec 17 and Dec 30. After an orientation at Central Institute of Classical Tamil in Chennai, they will be placed across nine host institutions, including IIT Madras, Central University of Pondicherry, Gandhigram Rural Institute and Sastra University.A senior official with the ministry of education said the dual initiatives would ""take Tamil learning beyond symbolic engagement to structured classroom exposure.""""KTS 4.0 celebrates India's knowledge traditions by making language a living bridge,"" said the official, adding, ""When Tamil teachers teach in Kashi and students from Varanasi learn Tamil in its native soil, we are renewing the shared heritage and ancient currents that have linked the two regions for centuries.""The Sage Agastya Vehicle Expedition (SAVE) - tracing ancient Tamil-Kashi linkages from Tenkasi to Varanasi - will also be launched on Dec 2, highlighting civilisational ties shaped by the Chera, Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Chalukya dynasties. It will conclude in Varanasi on Dec 12. Four allied events under Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat will run alongside the Sangamam.","Kashi Tamil Sangamam 4.0 will open at NaMo Ghat on Dec 2, coinciding with Karthigai Deepam on Dec 4.

Groundwater recharge sees marginal increase this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/groundwater-recharge-sees-marginal-increase-this-year/articleshow/125667455.cms,"Our govt prioritises water governance in its policies: PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Total annual groundwater recharge in the country marginally increased in 2025 compared to last year and so did the water availability for different uses, but nearly one-fourth of the assessment units collectively continued to be in semi-critical, critical and over-exploited categories due to notable decline in recharge in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Kerala, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir.The findings are part of the Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025 report, released by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) this week. It shows that the annual recharge increased from 446.9 billion cubic metre (BCM) in 2024 to 448.52 BCM in 2025. However, the annual recharge this year is still less than the 2023 level of 449.08 BCM.CGWB assessed a total of 6,762 units (blocks/mandals/talukas) in 2025. It found that the over-exploited administrative units are mostly concentrated in parts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The overexploitation occurred due to different reasons, including ""indiscriminate withdrawals"" of groundwater and climatic factors.Overall, 730 units (10.8%) in the country were categorised as over-exploited in 2025, indicating groundwater extraction exceeding the annual groundwater recharge. The report shows that the percentage of over-exploited, critical and semi-critical units exceeded 25% of the total units in nine states/UTs: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.""In some areas of the country, good continuous rainfall and management practices like groundwater augmentation and conservation measures taken up under central and state govt initiatives have resulted in improvement in groundwater situation,"" said the report.The states that reported significant increase in groundwater recharge this year include Bihar, Chhattisgarh, MP, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and UP.Rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge in the country. It contributes to nearly 60% of the total annual groundwater recharge. ""So, the increase in water recharge can be attributed to better monsoon rainfall this year than 2024. Good rainfall means less extraction of groundwater for farming operations,"" said an official.Area-wise, over 16% of the total 2,468 thousand sq km of recharge-worthy areas of the country are under over-exploited zones, followed by more than 12% under semi-critical and over 3% under critical zones.The report notes that the total number of assessment units increased from 6,746 in 2024 to 6,762 this year due to an increase reported from Himachal Pradesh, where the assessment last year was carried out with valleys as assessment units in place of blocks.","Annual groundwater recharge in the country marginally increased in 2025 compared to last year.

‘All 200 aircraft updated’: IndiGo completes A320 upgrade; safety checks continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-200-aircraft-updated-indigo-completes-a320-upgrade-safety-checks-continue/articleshow/125667303.cms,"Representative image

A320 Grounded: Here Is Why 6000 Aircraft Across World Couldn't Fly | Inside Story Of Software Snag

Regulators step in as airbus issues global warning





Airlines push through updates as delays ripple across airports





IndiGo confirmed late on Saturday that all 200 aircraft in its A320-family fleet had been fully updated, becoming the first major Indian operator to complete the mandatory enhancement. In a message posted on X, the airline said the work was “carefully coordinated” between engineering and operations teams and carried out with “minimal impact on customers’ journeys and zero cancellations”. It added that the entire fleet was now flying with the latest approved configuration, with routine monitoring continuing.Air India and Air India Express also reported rapid progress, with more than 90% of their affected aircraft upgraded by Saturday night. The push came after aviation regulators in India and Europe issued urgent directives requiring operators to install software protections designed to prevent possible data corruption in flight-control systems.Airbus triggered the global response on Friday after telling operators that intense solar radiation could corrupt data in key flight-control computers. The company identified a “significant number” of A320 family aircraft as potentially at risk and urged immediate installation of updated software or, in some cases, hardware realignment.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued an Airworthiness Directive soon after, covering a wide range of A319, A320 and A321 variants. Indian airlines were instructed to carry out the upgrades without delay, with a deadline set for early Sunday morning.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury issued an apology to airlines and passengers affected by delays, saying, “I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now. But we consider that nothing is more important than safety when people fly on one of our Airbus aircraft… Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible. ”According to DGCA data, 338 Indian A320-family aircraft required the update, with modifications completed on more than 270 by Saturday evening. IndiGo upgraded 184 of its 200 affected aircraft earlier in the day, before confirming full completion later at night. Air India reported successful resets on over 90% of its operating A320 fleet, while Air India Express said 22 of its 25 impacted aircraft had been updated.The upgrades—conducted at bases in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Kolkata—caused delays of 60–90 minutes at several airports. Air India Express cancelled four flights, though IndiGo and Air India avoided cancellations.Aviation experts said the issue demanded swift action. Former pilot Ehsan Khalid explained that the affected Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) is central to flight control: “The software problem with one of the ELACs is significant,” he said, citing a JetBlue incident where an A320 experienced an uncommanded pitch-down, injuring passengers.With most Indian aircraft now updated and global airlines racing to do the same, regulators and Airbus say they expect normal operations to resume rapidly—though full worldwide compliance may take longer, given the nearly 6,000 aircraft requiring upgrades.","IndiGo confirms all 200 aircraft in its A320-family fleet have been fully updated.

Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system.

NEW DELHI: The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, along with six other associates and business entities in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy to ""fraudulently"" acquire Associated Journals Ltd, then a Congress held entity having properties worth Rs 2,000 crore. The acquisition was made through Young Indian in which the Gandhis held 76% shareholding.The Delhi police FIR, dated Oct 3, is based on a complaint filed by the Headquarters Investigative Unit (HIU) of the ED, which has shared detailed findings of its investigation into National Herald money laundering case from 2008-2024.Sharing of information under Sec 66(2) of the PMLA allows ED to ask another enforcement agency to register and probe a scheduled offence, which can then become a predicate offence necessary for the ED to carry out its own investigation under the PMLA.The ongoing money laundering probe by ED is based on a private complaint from former BJP MP Subramanian Swamy and its cognisance by metropolitan magistrate's court in Patiala House in June 2014. In this case, the central agency filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) under PMLA against Gandhis and other accused on April 9 before a special MPs/MLAs court here at Rouse Avenue. The court has not taken cognisance yet of the matter.Congress has consistently disputed the charges and has accused ED of carrying out a political witchunt at govt's instance. When TOI contacted the party again on Delhi police registering an FIR, it said they are not aware of it.Besides Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the FIR registered by the Delhi Police has named three others, including chief of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda. It also names three entities, AJL, Young Indian and the Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, allegedly a Kolkata-based shell company that provided Rs 1 crore to Young India from which Gandhis paid Congress Rs 50 lakh to allegedly acquire AJL with assets allegedly worth Rs 2,000 crore.Sources said the police is likely to summon shareholders of AJL for questioning to ascertain whether the Congress consulted them and took their approval before transferring the company to Young Indian, beneficially owned by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.","The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.

In his keynote address at an event here to celebrate the 121st birth anniversary of Tata Group founder JRD Tata, Chandrasekaran said when the group bought Air India in 2022, he was asked why it was entering the aviation sector. “But I firmly believe for Tata Group, Air India is not just a business opportunity. It’s a responsibility,” he said.“Every single percentage growth in GDP will give a 2% growth in the domestic aviation sector. (If) India grows 8%, the aviation industry grows 16%. And this game will play out... at least for the next three decades. So, this is going to be a very exciting phase of economic growth, and for the aviation sector in particular,” he said, adding, “But it’s not easy. It’s increasingly difficult because the sector faces continuous challenges. ” He said the global supply chain makes the availability of parts, infrastructure and new aircraft unpredictable.Chandrasekaran also mentioned that aviation is a very capital-intensive business and the industry margins are thin. Noting that India is already the fourth largest economy, and becoming the third largest economy, he said the 8.2% GDP growth in the July-Sept quarter was “just fabulous.”And India will grow at 7% at least, this fiscal year, he added.According to him, there is increasing consumer confidence and consumption-led growth, and public infrastructure spending will additionally drive growth. “So, we will become a $5 trillion economy, and we will grow beyond that. We will do it faster, and the pace at which we add every additional trillion dollar will be shorter, and we will create exciting opportunities. But if this has to happen, one of the aspects that needs to work is connectivity,” he said.He said there are several aspects of the industry that one has to manage. “Geopolitics is a surprise. Suddenly, your flight routes will change, because you cannot fly over a territory. Your flights take longer, your fuel costs go up... We have to manage all of this,” he said.Chandrasekaran said demand for air travel is very high, and the aspirations of Indians are growing as everybody wants to be connected andtravel. “So I think our commitment is to build a world-class airline,” he further said.","Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran said Air India is not just a business opportunity but a “responsibility” for Tata Group.

Earlier on Saturday, the IMD said the system was moving north–northwest and was likely to approach the North Tamil Nadu–Puducherry–South Andhra Pradesh coast by the early hours of Sunday, November 30.In its updated alert issued at 8.58 pm on Saturday, the IMD said the storm had moved nearly northwards at 10 kmph over the past six hours and, at 5.30 pm, was centred over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu coasts. It was located about 110 km northeast of Jaffna, 80 km east of Vedaranniyam, 100 km southeast of Karaikal, 190 km south-southeast of Puducherry and 290 km south of Chennai.The storm is very likely to continue moving north–northwest and reach the North Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts by early Sunday morning. As it tracks along the coastline, the system is expected to pass the Tamil Nadu–Puducherry stretch at minimum distances of 60 km by Saturday midnight, 50 km by early Sunday morning, and about 25 km by Sunday evening.Residents have been urged to follow safety instructions and remain indoors during severe weather.In Tamil Nadu, the government has rolled out extensive precautionary measures, as it could potentially face major impact with strong wind and heavy rains already lashing parts of the state.Rain triggered by Cyclone Ditwah lashed coastal and delta districts on Saturday, with Ramanathapuram and Nagapattinam witnessing the heaviest impact. Normal life in Rameswaram remained disrupted for a second day due to continuous rain and strong winds, and a few trees were uprooted in Nagapattinam.Heavy rain and strong winds were reported across the Cauvery delta, and farmers said paddy crops over nearly one lakh acres were submerged. In Chennai, surplus water from major reservoirs is set to be released as a precaution.State Disaster Management Minister K K S S R Ramachandran said it was still unclear whether the cyclone would make landfall near Chennai, but the government was fully prepared, with 28 SDRF and NDRF teams on standby and more likely to be airlifted. About 6,000 relief camps have been set up, and the Air Force and Coast Guard have been alerted.In Cuddalore district alone, arrangements have been made to provide food and shelter for more than one lakh people. Local authorities have identified 239 vulnerable areas, taken 925 pregnant women under medical supervision and readied teams to clear fallen trees and drain water from low-lying stretches.NDRF teams have been deployed across coastal districts, including Villupuram, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Mayiladuthurai and Pudukkottai. Additional teams are on standby for Chennai and Puducherry.Meanwhile, flight operations across southern districts have been disrupted, with several flights cancelled. Small aircraft services at airports in Chennai, Madurai, Trichy and Thoothukudi will remain suspended from Sunday morning. Chennai Airport officials have advised passengers to check flight status and reschedule travel. Additionally, seven flights scheduled for Sunday have been cancelled at Chennai Airport amid forecasts of heavy rain. Of the day’s 47 scheduled services, 36 were domestic and 11 were international.Additionally, the Southern Railway also announced adjustments to train services for December. ""The wind velocity at Pamban Bridge has receded and was now within the prescribed threshold limit. Hence, the resumption of train traffic to Rameswaram will be announced soon,"" the release said.Districts across Tamil Nadu ordered shut down of educational institutions. Collectors in Trichy and Thanjavur declared holidays for schools, while Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai extended the order to both schools and colleges and advised institutions to postpone all special classes. Pudukkottai district followed with a holiday for schools and colleges, and Bharathidasan University in Trichy postponed its scheduled examinations. Schools in Villupuram have also been ordered shut as the administration prepares for heavy rainfall, possible flooding, and disruptions to transport and power lines.As for damage to crops, Minister R Ramachandran stated that heavy rainfall has impacted paddy cultivation in the Cauvery delta districts and added that the government will provide compensation to affected farmers. ""In the Delta Districts, paddy cultivation is affected due to flooding from rainwater. We expect it to drain within 2 days, and once it does, we will calculate the loss and provide compensation to farmers,"" he said.Ahead of cyclone making landfall in India after devastating Sri Lanka, Strong winds and heavy rainfall also lashed the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh in addition to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The IMD has also forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall across parts of Andhra Pradesh from November 30 to December 3 under the influence of Cyclonic Storm Ditwah. The system, centred over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Sri Lanka as of 11:30 am after moving northwards at 10 kmph, is expected to bring intense rain to Tirupati, Chittoor, Prakasam, Nellore, Kadapa and Annamayya districts.Additionally, Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA) managing director Prakhar Jain stated tgat isolated places in Tirupati and Chittoor districts could receive heavy rainfall through Saturday.Squally winds reaching 60 kmph, and gale winds up to 70 kmph on November 30, have also been predicted. Fishermen have been advised to stay ashore, and authorities have urged the public to remain cautious. Coastal parts of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh are already seeing rough seas, strong winds and steady rainfall.The APSDMA has urged residents in vulnerable pockets of Andhra Pradesh to remain indoors and avoid unnecessary travel during peak rainfall.Officials warned that strong winds could uproot trees, damage weak structures and harm standing crops, particularly vegetables and horticulture nearing harvest.Thunderstorms with lightning have been forecast across South Coastal Andhra Pradesh, North Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema from November 30 to December 3. ""Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely at isolated places over SCAP, Rayalaseema, North Coastal Andhra Pradesh (NCAP) and Yanam,"" said the IMD in a press release.Railways Ministry announced that union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw checked preparedness of Southern Railway ahead of the cyclone's expectation to touch Indian land. ""In view of Cyclone Ditwah, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw reviewed preparedness with Southern Railway teams to ensure minimal disruption. War Rooms at Board, zonal and divisional levels activated. Railways is closely coordinating with civil authorities and continuously monitoring the situation until normalcy returns,"" said the ministry in a post on X.Cyclone Ditwah has already left a severe trail of destruction in Sri Lanka, killing 153 people, leaving 130 missing and destroying nearly 15,000 homes. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency as tens of thousands remain in shelters and several districts remain inaccessible.Authorities warned that heavy rains and high winds may continue due to the system’s indirect impact even after its exit.India has launched Operation Sagar Bandhu, deploying C-130 and IL-76 aircraft loaded with relief supplies, along with a naval ship that donated rations to local authorities. More rescue personnel have been pressed into action as conditions worsen in central Sri Lanka.",Cyclone Ditwah continues to move north-northwest over the southwest Bay of Bengal. It is expected to reach close to the North Tamil Nadu–Puducherry–South Andhra Pradesh coast by early November 30. The cyclone has intensified the level of alertness as it already left 123 dead and several missing in Sri Lanka.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125658110,imgsize-1124319,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

A320 Grounded: Here Is Why 6000 Aircraft Across World Couldn't Fly | Inside Story Of Software Snag

NEW DELHI: A cosmic curveball forced a frantic fix as Indian operators of Airbus's best-selling A320 aircraft worked through the weekend to undo a software upgrade now tied to solar-flare risk.They rushed to roll back flight-control updates on 338 identified aircraft. IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express expect to finish the downgrade by late Saturday-Sunday night, averting what regulators warned could have caused pilots to briefly lose control during intense radiation events. Not all A320s were impacted.Working under DGCA supervision, airlines pushed the fixes without grounding fleets and avoiding mass cancellations at the peak of holiday travel. Updates took roughly 40-50 minutes for each aircraft. By 5.30pm Saturday, only four Air India Express flights were cancelled, with carriers bracing for delays of up to 90 minutes.According to DGCA, IndiGo, the world's largest A320 operator, had updated 184 of 200 affected jets by Saturday evening; Air India 69 of 113; Air India Express 17 of 25 - 278 aircraft, or 82% of the 338 flagged globally in Indian fleets. IndiGo announced before midnight it had completed the task.Earlier, IndiGo said on X its engineers had completed updates on 160 of 200 mandated aircraft by Saturday evening, with ""minimal delays and zero cancellations"", and expected to meet all deadlines.Air India said its teams had worked ""round-the-clock,"" anticipated full compliance within EASA's timelines and reported ""no cancellations"" due to the task, though some flights would run slightly late.Air India Express said most of its A320 fleet was already compliant and remaining aircraft were on track, crediting coordinated work across engineering, operations and safety teams.Airbus triggered the scramble late Friday after directing operators to revert flight control computers to a 2022 software build. Regulators in Europe, India and US quickly issued emergency orders.The move followed an Oct 30 JetBlue A320 event in which the jet allegedly pitched nose-down without pilot input while flying Cancun-Newark. The aircraft diverted to Tampa, where 15-20 passengers injured in the uncontrolled descent were hospitalised. Investigators later linked the issue to an upgrade, dubbed L104, for the elevator and aileron computer (ELAC).Airbus warned that solar radiation could corrupt data critical to flight controls on certain software-hardware combinations, prompting operators to revert to the older build on susceptible jets.Indian carriers received the first late-night alert around 9.30pm Friday. ""At first, it seemed a much bigger issue that would require grounding and a massive impact,"" said an official managing the response. Coordinated work across multiple maintenance bases revealed the rollback could be completed in under 50 minutes on newer aircraft, while older jets required additional hardware changes.Global carriers also cancelled and delayed services as the scale of the alert briefly appeared to run into thousands of aircraft before being narrowed to a smaller subset. Airbus said it acted after analysing an event ""revealing that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls"", adding it worked with regulators to ensure fleets remained safe.","Indian operators of Airbus's best-selling A320 aircraft worked through the weekend to undo a software upgrade.

HC says cross-LoC trade between J&K & PoK is intra-state trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-says-cross-loc-trade-between-jk-pok-is-intra-state-trade/articleshow/125663637.cms,"Pak Slams Rajnath's Sindh Remark But Ignores Its Leader Claiming Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana As Own

SRINAGAR: A division bench of the Jammu and Kashmir high court has stated that cross-LoC trade between Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir amounts to intra-state trade as PoK is part of Jammu and Kashmir.While deciding petitions from cross-LoC traders, the HC said, “It is not disputed by learned counsel appearing on either side that the area of the state presently under de-facto control of Pakistan is part of territories of the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, in the instant case, the location of the suppliers and the place of supply of goods were within the then state of Jammu Kashmir (now Union Territory) and, therefore, the cross-LoC trade effected by petitioners during the tax period in question was nothing but intra-state trade. ”“We appreciate the fair stand taken by the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners despite there being contrary pleadings disputing the nature of cross-LoC trade as intra-state trade,” the division bench, comprising Justices Sanjeev Kumar and Sanjay Parihar, observed.The petitioners had challenged show-cause notices issued to them by the Superintendent, CGST, under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, stating that when trade was started in 2008, “intra-state sales tax was governed by the Jammu and Kashmir Value Added Taxes Act, which provided that cross-LoC trade was a zero-rated sale.”However, in 2017, when GST was rolled out, the authorities started investigations against the petitioners to probe whether they had paid GST on their outward and inward supplies. After getting information that there were huge outward and inward supplies effected by the petitioners, show-cause notices were served on them.The petitioners also argued that even if it was assumed that the trade was intra-state, a tax demand would be impermissible as the trade was barter trade where no money exchanged hands.The HC said it found no merit in all these petitions and dismissed them.In 2008 after improving relations between India and Pakistan as confidence-building measures, both govts decided to allow free cross-LoC trade between them on certain terms and conditions.However, on April 9, 2019, the Indian govt suspended cross-LoC trade on grounds that the trade routes were being misused to funnel illegal weapons, narcotics, and fake currency.Two steps — a cross-LoC bus service and cross-LoC trade — were seen as the two biggest CBMs between India and Pakistan. On April 7, 2005, the then prime minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, had flagged off the first cross-LoC bus service, titled Karwaan-e-Aman, or peace caravan, that connected Srinagar to Muzaffarabad. Later, cross-LoC trade, established as barter trade, began on Oct 21, 2008, on two routes — Salamabad (Uri)-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakot. Traders on either side of the LoC were permitted to exchange 21 mutually-agreed items.","A division bench of the Jammu and Kashmir high court has stated that cross-LoC trade amounts to intra-state trade.

Recall sleeper buses flouting safety norms; hold officials accountable: NHRC to states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/recall-sleeper-buses-flouting-safety-norms-hold-officials-accountable-nhrc-to-states/articleshow/125661773.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: Amid instances of fatal fires in sleeper coach buses, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed all chief secretaries to take immediate action, including to recall buses flouting mandatory safety norms and carry out rectifications. These include removing the partition between driver and passenger section, installation of fire detection and suppression system (FDSS) and stricter checking of accreditation and certification of bus body builders.Terming the violation of motor vehicle rules and automotive standards laying down mandatory norms for sleeper buses by bus body builders and officials as “criminal negligence”, the commission issued directions to state govts to fix accountability on persons whose negligence has endangered public safety. “Initiate immediate action to fix accountability on officials who granted approval for fitness certification of CMVR and AIS,” the human right watchdog said. It has asked states to submit an action taken report in two weeks.The instructions were issued after the commission received an action taken report (ATR) submitted by Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT), an entity under road transport ministry, into the fatal bus fire on Jaisalmer-Jodhpur highway on Oct 14 that claimed 20 lives and left another 16 injured.CIRT identified shortcomings in the bus body building, which violated the safety standards prescribed under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR) and Automotive Industry Standard (AIS) for sleeper coach buses. These included the driver partition door, inadequate emergency exits and non-existent FDSS. These findings have also been formally communicated to Rajasthan govt.CIRT suggested recalling all sleeper coach buses, immediate removal of driver partition doors and sliders fitted to all sleeper berths. It also suggested that all such buses should install FDSS within one month and fire extinguishers of 10 kg must be checked and all bus bodies built with extension to chassis must be removed from operation.NHRC noted that the bus that caught fire was not built in accordance to rules for sleeper coaches with the bus body builder violating mandatory safety norms and wondered how it was permitted to operate despite gross violations. “This reflects serious systemic lapses not only on the bus manufacturer/ body builder but also on part of transport department officials who are responsible for approval, inspection and fitness certificate. This compels the commission to further observe that this accident was completely preventable, had the officials concerned enforced mandatory safety standards and in letter and spirit,” it said.","The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed all chief secretaries to take immediate action.

IndiGo And Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India

NEW DELHI: Airlines across nation are rushing to complete emergency software upgrades on more than 350 Airbus A320-family aircraft after a rare global safety directive warned that intense solar radiation could corrupt flight-control data and trigger sudden, uncommanded aircraft movements.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ordered immediate compliance on Saturday after Airbus flagged a vulnerability in ELAC B flight-control computers running software version L104, the same configuration linked to an October 30 JetBlue A320 incident in which the aircraft unexpectedly pitched downward without pilot input, injuring several passengers and prompting a US federal investigation.The Ministry of Civil Aviation, quoted by ANI, said late Saturday that IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express have accelerated upgrades across their fleets and expect full compliance by the end of the day. IndiGo has 200 affected aircraft and has completed upgrades on 184, with the remainder expected to be cleared by 23:59 hours. Air India has 113 aircraft requiring the fix and has completed 69 installations, while Air India Express has upgraded 17 of its 25 affected aircraft. The DGCA has stressed that no aircraft may operate until the mandatory modification is complete, except for repositioning flights to maintenance bases.Airbus issued the urgent global alert after determining that solar flares can, under certain conditions, corrupt data used by the aircraft’s elevator control computers, potentially causing unexpected control-surface movements. The company has instructed operators worldwide to immediately revert to an earlier, stable software version. The issue affects about 6,000 A320-family aircraft globally, although roughly 1,000 older jets may require hardware replacements, a process that will take longer.The directive has triggered widespread disruption during one of the busiest travel periods of the year, with airlines across Europe and the Americas reporting delays and cancellations as they verify software versions and apply the fix. American Airlines has identified hundreds of aircraft requiring the update, Air France has cancelled several flights, Avianca has paused ticket sales into December, and carriers including Delta, Finnair, Volaris and Air New Zealand have warned of operational impact. Europe’s aviation regulator, EASA, has directed operators to complete the fix before their next flight, acknowledging the inconvenience but underscoring that safety remains paramount.Although the update takes only around two hours per aircraft, maintenance lines worldwide are already stretched by ongoing engine-related groundings and labour shortages, forcing airlines to use overnight maintenance windows and short turnaround periods to complete the repair. Airbus’s directive is among the most significant recalls in its history and comes at a time when more than 3,000 A320-family aircraft were airborne globally, highlighting the scale and urgency of the operation.India operates one of the world’s largest A320 fleets, dominated by IndiGo and the Air India group. The A320, which introduced fly-by-wire controls to commercial aviation in the 1980s, now accounts for a substantial share of global traffic. The latest safety update adds to the mounting technical pressures on the aviation sector as regulators move quickly to address emerging electronic and software vulnerabilities linked to space-weather events.","IndiGo and Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India.

Delhi Court Extends Anmol Bishnoi’s Custody; NIA Probes Gang-Terror Links

NEW DELHI: A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court has convicted two additional accused in the Al-Qaeda conspiracy case, sentencing them to 20 months in prison.The verdict follows last month’s ruling in which another individual was jailed and fined for involvement in the same terror plot linked to the banned organisation.Mohd. Mustaqueem and Shakeel, both residents of Lucknow, have been convicted by a special NIA court under Section 25(1B)(a) of the Arms Act read with Section 120B of the IPC. The court sentenced each of them to 20 months’ imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000, as cited by ANI.The convictions follow the NIA’s filing of a main and a supplementary chargesheet against six arrested individuals in the Al-Qaeda conspiracy case.The arrests were made following information provided by Al-Qaeda operative Umar Halmandi, who had recruited individuals in Lucknow to build an Al-Qaeda module in the region.Halmandi also informed investigators about the outfit’s affiliate, Ansaar Gajwatul Hind (AGH), which had been formed to carry out terror attacks in several Uttar Pradesh cities, particularly Lucknow, before August 15, 2021.""Umar, who was based at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was operating in Lucknow with the aim of preparing youth to carry out terrorist acts before Independence Day 2021 in various cities of Uttar Pradesh, it was found during the probe in the case,"" an official statement said on Saturday, as cited by PTI.According to the NIA, Mohammad Moid, along with co-accused Shakeel and Mohd. Mustaqeem, helped Minhaj and Museeruddin procure weapons and ammunition to advance AGH’s terror plot.Mohammad Moid has been sentenced to the period he has already served in prison, 1 year, 9 months, and 13 days, along with a fine of Rs 5,000. The sentence, under Section 25 (1B)(a) of the Arms Act, read with Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), was handed down after he pleaded guilty.According to NIA investigations, Minhaj was radicalised by the accused Tawheed and Adil Nabi, also known as Musa, and subsequently conspired with Museeruddin, who pledged loyalty (baiyat) to further the terror plot. Together, Minhaj and Museeruddin procured arms, ammunition, and explosive materials with the intent to wage war against the Government of India.","Mohd.

SIR issue set to rock winter session

NEW DELHI: The all-party meeting ahead of the winter session of Parliament will be held at 11 am on Sunday, a day before the session opens.It will be followed by the Business Advisory Council meetings of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at 4 pm.A meeting of the Floor Leaders of the opposition INDIA bloc will be held at 10 am on Monday in the office of Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.During the all-party meeting, the government is expected to seek cooperation from all political parties to ensure the smooth functioning of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The session will conclude on December 19, with several important legislations scheduled for discussion and passage during this period.Parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) are expected to raise the issue of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise — and the deaths allegedly linked to it — in West Bengal and other parts of the country during the Parliament session, according to senior TMC leader Derek O'Brien.The opposition, including the TMC, which is seeking a fourth consecutive term in West Bengal when the state goes to polls in mid-2026, has been accusing the Election Commission of imposing “SIR-linked inhuman pressure” on ground staff through compressed timelines and “unworkable deadlines.”O'Brien claimed the ""accelerated"" voter-roll revision has caused fear, fatigue, and fatalities among Booth Level Officers (BLOs) and citizens. He added that the party will question why West Bengal has been subjected to the ""most intensive scrutiny,"" while several border states with similar demographics have been exempted.“Why have Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur, all bordering countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, been entirely exempted? Why is Assam under a lighter Special Revision? Is the real intent to challenge Bengali identity and systematically prune Bengali voters from the rolls?” O'Brien asked.Official data shows the West Bengal SIR is nearing completion, with 7.64 crore forms circulated, 82 per cent digitised, and 99.8 per cent of voters covered in the door-to-door verification drive.Phase two of the “purification” of electoral rolls — the first phase was conducted in Bihar ahead of its recently held assembly polls — began on November 4 and covers nine states, including West Bengal, and three Union Territories. The final voter list is expected to be published on February 7, 2026.","All-party meeting ahead of the winter session of Parliament will be held at 11 am on Sunday, a day before the session opens.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","PM Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus.

IndiGo And Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India

10 things to know about the Airbus A320 recall





Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft, a move that is expected to affect more than half of the global fleet. This large-scale recall may cause widespread disruption, especially in the United States, where it coincides with one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.

Airbus has revealed that a recent incident involving one of its A320-family aircraft has uncovered a potential risk linked to ""intense solar radiation"", which may corrupt data essential for the aircraft's flight-control systems. Following this finding, the company identified a significant number of A320 aircraft currently in service that could be affected by the issue.

Air India has acknowledged the directive, saying it is “aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in service across airline operators,” and noted that the requirement will involve a “software/hardware realignment” on part of its fleet. The airline has warned that ""longer turnaround times and delays"" are likely during the update process.

Air India recently completed a major retrofit programme for its older A320neo fleet. With 27 refurbished aircraft, 14 newly delivered A320neos, and additional planes added after the Vistara merger, the airline now operates around 104 A320-family aircraft with new or upgraded interiors.

IndiGo has also confirmed compliance with the directive, emphasising that “safety comes first” and stating that it is carrying out the updates “with full diligence and care.” The airline has indicated that some flights may see schedule changes while the work is underway.

Most of IndiGo’s A320 fleet consists of newer variants, with older models now in single digits. With over 300 A320-family planes, the airline is expected to complete updates on nearly 250 aircraft by Monday or Tuesday, according to sources. Air India, with about 120–125 A320s, is expected to finish updates on more than 100 aircraft in a similar timeframe.

Industry observers say this may be one of the largest recalls Airbus has faced in its 55-year history, as Reuters reported. The timing is notable, coming just weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered aircraft model in the world.

The repair itself is expected to be relatively simple and mainly involves reverting to a previous software version. Even so, airlines must complete the process before the planes can return to passenger service, except for repositioning flights to repair centres.

Airlines across North America, South America, Europe, India, and New Zealand have warned that the required repairs could lead to delays or cancellations. American Airlines, the largest A320 operator globally, expects to update around 340 of its 480 A320s, with each fix likely taking about two hours.

Other major airlines—such as Lufthansa, IndiGo, and easyJet—are also planning brief groundings for the updates. In South America, Avianca has said more than 70% of its fleet is affected, leading the carrier to temporarily shut ticket sales until December 8 for certain travel dates.

The recall comes at a challenging time for the aviation industry, which is already dealing with heavy workloads at repair shops, long delays for separate engine-related inspections, and labour shortages. These factors are expected to slow down the completion of repairs and add further pressure to global flight operations.

JetBlue incident leads to probe





NEW DELHI: Air travel in India and around the world is expected to face major disruptions after Europe-based Airbus issued a technical directive ordering a software upgrade for its A320 family aircraft. In India, more than 300 IndiGo and Air India A320 planes will remain grounded for the next two to three days while the update is carried out, with normal operations expected to resume by Monday or Tuesday.Globally, around 6,000 aircraft from A320 fleet are likely to be impacted. The grounding is significant because Airbus and its main rival Boeing together control over three-quarters of the world's commercial aircraft fleet, meaning any large-scale recall has an immediate and widespread impact on global air traffic.The technical directive reportedly came shortly after an incident involving a JetBlue A320 aircraft, which led to discussions among safety regulators and eventually contributed to a deeper review of the fleet’s software configuration. While details are still emerging, the episode is believed to have triggered closer scrutiny and may have played a role in Airbus deciding to issue a global advisory and recall order for immediate corrective action.","Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

NEW DELHI: Delhi witnesses slight improvement in its air quality on Sunday morning, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) moving from the ‘very poor’ to the ‘poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The city recorded an AQI of 269 at 7 am, showing progress from the 305 reported at 4 pm yesterday.Despite this improvement, ITO and several parts of New Delhi continued to remain shrouded in thick smog.Shadipur reported the highest pollution level at 335, followed by Jahangirpuri (324), Nehru Nagar (319), RK Puram (307), and the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences in Dilshad Garden (303), all categorised as ‘very poor’. Mandir Marg recorded an AQI of 158, placing it in the ‘moderate’ range.Several locations fell under the ‘poor’ category, including Bawana (295), Sirifort (293), Rohini (291), Vivek Vihar (289), DTU (285), Burari Crossing (283), Mundka (283), Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range (282), Dwarka Sector 8 (281), Chandni Chowk (281), Patparganj (280), Wazirpur (281), Anand Vihar (281), Sonia Vihar (277), Narela (276), Ashok Vihar (275), ITO (269), JLN Stadium (269), Punjabi Bagh (265), Pusa (263), and SRRI Mathura Road (262).The Delhi government said it is monitoring pollution levels regularly and implementing measures to reduce emissions. However, the situation has triggered strong political criticism. Senior Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit accused the authorities of failing to act effectively.Calling the rising pollution a form of “murder”, Dikshit said: “Delhi's environment has become utterly polluted, and this has increasingly been seen over the last six to seven years. People may measure it in AQI or any other form, but I consider it murder. Doctors have said that those living in Delhi in such an environment will see their life expectancy reduced.

NEW DELHI: A probe into illegal betting-linked money laundering has led the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to a bike-taxi driver in Delhi, whose bank account saw unexplained deposits of Rs 331.36 crore over eight months.Officials said the agency stumbled upon the Rapido driver while tracking transactions connected to the 1xBet betting network.

Donald Trump’s childhood home up for sale: Queens house hits market again at $2.3 million,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-childhood-home-up-for-sale-queens-house-hits-market-again-at-2-3-million-know-all-about-the-tudor-style-property/articleshow/125668187.cms,"Image source: AP, X/@Teraan9







US President Donald Trump ’s childhood home in Queens, New York, has returned to the market with a price tag of $2.3 million, following extensive renovations, according to The New York Times.The Tudor-style house, built in 1940 by Trump’s father, real-estate developer Fred Trump, is located in the upscale Jamaica Estates neighbourhood. Trump lived in the property until he was four, after which the family moved to a larger brick mansion nearby.The property has a complex recent history. It was purchased in March by real-estate developer Tommy Lin for $835,000, who immediately undertook a top-to-bottom refurbishment, investing approximately $500,000. Lin described the home as “not livable” at the time due to water and power issues and a burst pipe that caused significant mould.Prior to Lin’s purchase, the house had been owned by Michael Davis, a Manhattan-based private equity partner, who bought it for $1.39 million and carried out renovations.Over the years, the home has seen periods of disrepair and unusual use. At one stage, it became a temporary hangout for feral cats. Davis had also attempted to rent it out on Airbnb, though the effort ended after Oxfam America staged a publicity visit during the United Nations General Assembly to highlight the global refugee crisis.The fully renovated property now offers five bedrooms, three full bathrooms, two powder rooms, a finished basement, and a detached two-car garage, along with “refined modern updates” such as herringbone wood floors and a high-end kitchen. It sits on approximately 2,500 square feet of living space and has become a focal point for both Trump supporters and political protestors.Trump himself has occasionally reflected on the property. In a 2016 interview with Jimmy Fallon, he described its state of disrepair as “sad” while noting it was “where I was born” and that he had a “really good childhood” there.Earlier this month, Independent reported that US President Donald Trump’s childhood home in New York City had gone on the market, despite having earlier fallen into disrepair including the phase when the property was temporarily overrun by feral cats.","The Tudor-style house was built in 1940 by Trump’s father, real-estate developer Fred Trump.

Grounding for upgrade: Airbus A320 planes hit by software glitch globally; 350 of IndiGo & AI impacted in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/grounding-for-upgrade-airbus-a320-planes-hit-by-software-glitch-globally-350-of-indigo-ai-impacted-in-india/articleshow/125645449.cms,"IndiGo And Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India

NEW DELHI: Air travel will get every impacted in India and across the globe with the world’s largest selling single aisle — Airbus A320 family of planes — going to be grounded this weekend for a software upgrade. In India, over 350 A320 family planes of IndiGo and Air India Group will be grounded for this upgrade that is expected to be over in 2-3 days. They are expected to resume flying by next Monday or Tuesday. Globally about 6,000 aircraft are likely to be impacted.The upgrade is in wake of an American low cost carrier JetBlue’s A320 operating from Cancun to Newark on Oct 30, 2025, “unexpectedly pitch(ing) downward without pilot input.” The uncontrolled descent “likely occurred during an ELAC (flight control computer) switch change,” according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The aircraft diverted to Tampa, where some passengers were hospitalised.Tackling this issue requires a software upgrade. For the new A320 family planes, the work requires about half an hour on each plane through “loading facility.” On older A320s, some hardware upgrade will also be required and hence the overall work will take longer.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive (EAD) for Airbus A320 family of planes which “may unfortunately cause disruption to flight schedules and inconvenience to passengers. As is always the case in aviation, safety is paramount.”In India, almost all IndiGo A320 family planes are the new variants. The older A320s are in single digits. So IndiGo, which has over 350 A320 family planes in its fleet, upgrade on the required 250 aircraft should be over by Monday or Tuesday, said sources. Air India, which has about 120-125 A320 family planes, should also have the same situation, with over 100 impacted.Air India said on X early Saturday morning: “We are aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in-service across airline operators. This will result in a software/hardware realignment on a part of our fleet, leading to longer turnaround time and delays to our scheduled operations. Air India regrets any inconvenience this may cause to passengers till the reset is carried out across the fleet. ”Airbus said in a statement: “Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Airbus has consequently identified a significant number of A320 family aircraft currently in-service which may be impacted. Airbus has worked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an alert operators transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly. This AOT will be reflected in an emergency airworthiness directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).”Airbus “acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers” and apologised “for the inconvenience caused”. The European airspace major said it “will work closely with operators, while keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.”In its emergency airworthiness directive regarding the issue, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) gave the reason for the same: “An Airbus A320 aeroplane recently experienced an uncommanded and limited pitch down event. The autopilot remained engaged throughout the event, with a brief and limited loss of altitude, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Preliminary technical assessment done by Airbus identified a malfunction of the affected ELAC as possible contributing factor. This condition, if not corrected, could lead in the worst-case scenario to an uncommanded elevator movement that may result in exceeding the aircraft’s structural capability. To address this potential unsafe condition, Airbus issued the alert operators transmission, providing instructions to install a serviceable ELAC.”","350 A320 family planes of IndiGo and Air India Group will be grounded for this upgrade that is expected to be over in 2-3 days.

Untold Bravery in Operation Sindoor: CISF Reveals It Foiled Pakistan Attack on Uri Hydro Power Plant

NEW DELHI: India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, gaining the status of 'major power.' India secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor The first two ranks of 'superpowers' were retained by the United States and China, respectively.In 2024, India was ranked among the 'middle powers,' with a comprehensive score of 38.1, whereas in this year's reports, India scored 40 out of 100. It stands ahead of Japan and Russia, which hold the fourth and fifth positions, scoring 38.8 and 32.1, respectively. However, the nation still sees a large aspirational gap as compared to China, which has 73.7 points on the index. The US topped the rankings with 80.5 points.As per the detailed assessments, India's rank is backed by its growth in terms of economic and military capabilities. Notably, India rose to ninth place in economic relationships, driven by increases in inward investment.The Lowy Institute said the modest advances in India’s geopolitical relevance were measured through international connectivity, leverage, and technological development.It also highlighted India's military capabilities to have grown steadily.""For the most part, these gains were from improved expert appraisals of its capability, which were likely influenced by India's performance in Operation Sindoor, launched in May 2025, which added to India's recent combat experience,"" the institute said.India saw its sharpest decline in terms of defence networks, dropping its rank to 11th position. It dropped two ranks lower as compared to the 2024 rankings, which were overtaken by the Philippines and Thailand.According to the index, India overtook China as the country attracting the most inward investment after the United States, an indicator capturing 10-year cumulative flows.Overall, the institute concludes that India’s recent military experience and economic momentum have strengthened its regional standing, even as challenges persist in building defence partnerships.The Australia-based think tank study assesses a nation's ability to influence its external environment among the power states in Asia.","India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, gaining the status of'major power' India secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor.

Gemini 3 boosts Google’s market value





Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Years of hard work





Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0.

Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath has the internet talking after posting a short, high-production video clip featuring Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . This sparked an immediate speculation about a rare podcast appearance by the billionaire executive. Kamath, known for hosting the ‘WTF is?’ podcast, shared the video on X (formerly Twitter) showing the two executives seated together amidst what appears to be industrial factory machinery, framed by an American flag.The clip shows both Kamath and Musk sipping coffee, speaking nothing at all. They are looking at each other, laughing about something. Kamath is seen sipping a coffee from a mug that has “SpaceX” written on it.Kamath captioned the post simply “Caption this” and tagged Musk, leveraging the interaction to build hype for the unconfirmed episode.The 39-second teaser posted sent social media into a frenzy, with the video quickly racking up millions of views and thousands of comments within hours. Many initially questioned whether the clip was generated using artificial intelligence, with comments flooding in asking ""Is it AI?"" and jokes like ""We got Elon Musk and Nikhil's podcast before GTA VI.""The 'WTF is?' podcast is positioned as a knowledge platform dedicated to accelerating entrepreneurial growth and fostering robust intellectual debate. Kamath has had a star-studded guest lineup and has become a notable destination for high-profile figures across global business, technology, and politics.For example, the podcast has had guests like Microsoft founder Bill Gates , investor Vinod Khosla and Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas. Other notable personalities include Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani. Its most high-profile guest to date was Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who appeared on the episode released on January 10.Meanwhile, Musk has been a regular at Joe Rogan’s podcast, where he has talked a lot about topics ranging from electric vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI), space exploration, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and politics, among other things.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath has the internet talking after posting a short, high-production video clip featuring Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

‘Growth model no longer good enough’: Pak central bank chief’s dire warning; calls it ‘inflection point’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/growth-model-no-longer-good-enough-pak-central-bank-chief-warns-calls-it-inflection-point/articleshow/125616793.cms,"Representational image

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) Ahmad said Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"
