Axiom-4’s science and outreach success





What’s next for him





How he’ll cope with Earth’s gravity

A landmark mission for India

NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla , the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS), is set to return to Earth on Tuesday, July 15, marking the end of an 18-day scientific mission aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crewed flight.The Dragon spacecraft, carrying Shukla and fellow crew members Commander Peggy Whitson, ESA astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, and Hungarian astronaut Tibor Kapu, is scheduled to undock from the ISS on Monday at 4:30 pm IST, with splashdown expected in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California around 3:00 pm IST on Tuesday. The journey back is expected to last approximately 22 hours.The Ax-4 farewell ceremony was held aboard the ISS on Sunday evening, also attended by members of Nasa 's Expedition 73. Speaking at the event, Shukla reflected on his experience: “It almost seems magical to me... It has been a fantastic journey for me.” Channeling the iconic words of Rakesh Sharma, India’s first astronaut in space, he added, “Even today, Bharat looks 'saare jahan se accha' from above.”In Lucknow, anticipation is high. Shukla’s mother, Asha Shukla, told ANI, “We pray to God that he completes his mission successfully and comes back to Earth as soon as possible and meets us… We will give him a grand welcome.”His father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, confirmed the flight timeline, saying, “We were waiting for this, so we are happy that he is coming back. We pray to God that he comes back safely.”Asha added that she is preparing all his favourite dishes: “He told us that this time, after coming back, he wants to eat everything he hasn't had in the past five-six years due to being abroad.”Before launch, Shukla had packed mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa for his time in space, saying, “There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa with me.”Launched on June 25 from Nasa ’s Kennedy Space Center aboard a Falcon-9 rocket, Axiom-4 docked with the ISS on June 26. Over 18 days, the team carried out more than 60 experiments, including studies on human health, space agriculture, mental well-being, and space suit materials. The mission will return with over 580 pounds of cargo, including scientific equipment and research samples.Shukla focused on testing glucose monitors in microgravity, contributing to efforts aimed at enabling diabetic individuals to participate in future space missions.In his final remarks from space, Shukla said, “I carry with me a lot of memories and learnings. But what stays with me most is what humanity can achieve when we all come together for a common goal.” He also thanked ISRO, Nasa , SpaceX, and Axiom Space, and acknowledged the contributions of Indian students and researchers to the mission’s outreach goals.After splashdown, Shukla and his crewmates will be transported to Nasa ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will undergo post-landing protocols under medical supervision before being cleared for return to their home countries.He will undergo a series of medical and psychological evaluations, covering physical fitness, balance, reflexes, cardiovascular function, and immune response. Nasa ’s Human Health and Performance team will lead the assessments.Shukla will also be debriefed on his mission experience and the experiments he conducted. This data will aid both Axiom and ISRO as they plan future collaborative space missions. He is expected to be formally recognised by Indian scientific institutions, including ISRO and the Indian Air Force, and may receive honours from government bodies for his achievements in space exploration.After spending over two weeks in microgravity, Shukla’s body will need time to readjust to Earth’s gravity. Space travel leads to temporary loss of bone density and muscle mass, along with fluid redistribution that affects blood circulation and organ function.Nasa specialists note that astronauts often experience symptoms such as ""puffy face,"" ""chicken legs,"" vision changes, and even increased height during the early days in space. Upon return, rehabilitation protocols kick in. These include compression garments to stabilise blood pressure, hydration with salt tablets and water, and physical therapy to rebuild strength, coordination, and balance.According to Dr. Dervay from Nasa, “Almost every organ system in the body is impacted to some degree – whether it's the skin, the neurovestibular, the bone, muscle, the immunological system, the cardiovascular system.”However, Nasa says no extraordinary measures are needed in Shukla’s case. “We don’t see any need for any special precaution,” said Dina Contella, deputy manager of Nasa’s ISS Program. “Like any astronauts coming back, there is an acclimation period, and so that will vary by crew member.”Shukla’s recovery will also help space agencies better understand the impact of short-duration missions, crucial for long-term exploration goals such as missions to the Moon and Mars.Shukla’s mission is being seen as a symbolic and scientific milestone in India’s space journey. Coming ahead of ISRO’s Gaganyaan mission, it represents India’s growing presence in international space collaboration. At the farewell, Shukla noted, “If we decide, then even stars are attainable (taara api prapyante).”As he prepares to step back on Earth, Shukla brings not just research findings and experience, but a message of aspiration, unity, and national pride.(With inputs from agencies)","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS) He is set to return to Earth on Tuesday, July 15, marking the end of an 18-day scientific mission aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crewed flight.

LONDON: Relatives of flyers who died in the June 12 Air India crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the Tatas-owned airline, Boeing and the Indian government.“This report is wrong. We don’t accept it,” said Ameen Siddiqui, whose British brother-in-law and Gloucestershire resident Akeel Nanabawa, died alongside his wife Hannaa Vorajee and their daughter Sara in the June 12 crash of the Ahmedabad-London flight.Speaking to the UK’s The Telegraph from Surat, Siddiqui alleged that “they want to blame dead pilots who can’t defend themselves”. Siddiqui added that he had rejected Air India ’s compensation offer and would take the airline to court for “killing our family members”.UK law firms are already representing families of dozens of passengers who died in the AI 171 crash and considering legal action against Boeing and Air India.Tushar Joge, whose male cousin’s in-laws, Vallabh Nagji Agheda and wife Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, both in their 70s, died in the crash, echoed the claim that the probe report was a “cover-up” for Air India and Boeing.“We were pre-empting that they would start blaming the pilots.Why are they not looking for a mechanical fault? How qualified are the people in the Indian Air Accident Investigation Bureau? The FAA (US aviation regulator) gave an advisory in 2018 to check the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. Shouldn’t they have made this a mandatory requirement rather than an advisory?” Joge asked.The Agheda couple were coming to the UK to spend time with their youngest daughter and her family in Reading. Speaking to TOI from Vadodara, their son-in-law said: “It does not look like it’s the pilot’s fault. It could be Boeing’s design fault with the switches, or it could be Air India’s maintenance issues. Most of the families believe it’s a problem withthe aircraft. Air India is helping us with compensation but we are more concerned about getting the right report. We want the truth to make sure another disaster doesn’t happen.”Imtiyaz Ali Syed, whose London-based brother Javed died with his wife and two children lamented that the probe report was replete with “aviation jargon praising Boeing’s systems” while saying “nothing conclusive”. “Everyone, Air India, Boeing, government, has something to protect. But we have lost our entire families. How can we move on without the truth?” Imtiyaz asked.Sameer Rafik, cousin of crash victim Faizan Rafik from Leicester, told the BBC he did not trust the Indian government. “Until the airline provides the cockpit recording to us, I’m not going to believe the report,” Rafik said.","Relatives of flyers who died in the June 12 Air India crash have slammed the preliminary probe as a “cover-up” to protect the Tatas-owned airline, Boeing and the Indian government. “This report is wrong.

Aviation Expert Links Mid-Air Fuel Cut-Off to AI171 Crash After AAIB Preliminary Report

Until final report is out, any speculation unacceptable: Union

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A day after Airline Pilots' Association of India said Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete, Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), one of the Air India pilots' unions, on Sunday slammed the ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" that has been doing the rounds since the report was made public on Saturday.AAIB had stated that both fuel switches on the Boeing 787 transitioned from ""run"" to ""cut-off"" three seconds after it took off from the runway, cutting off fuel supply to the engines. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other, 'Why did you cut off (the fuel supply)?' The other responded he did not do so,"" according to the report. However, it didn't elucidate why the fuel control switches were cut off.Soon after the report's release, pilots and aviation experts, in interviews and posts on social media, claimed one of the pilots had knowingly cut off the fuel supply switch.The pilots of AI 171, which crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions, ICPA, one of the AI pilots’ unions, said, adding the crew should not be vilified based on conjecture.Referring to a 2018 safety bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches — which could cut off fuel supply to the engines without pilot input — the report said that Air India did not carry out the inspection as it was not deemed mandatory.“In the aftermath of this incident, we are deeply disturbed by speculative narratives emerging in sections of the media and public discourse — particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide. Let us be unequivocally clear: there is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage, and invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible — it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved,” said ICPA.“Pilots undergo extensive psychological and professional screening, recurrent training, and operate under the highest standards of safety, responsibility, and mental fitness. To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it added.“As aviation professionals, we trust and respect the rigorous investigative protocols established by competent authorities. These inquiries are designed to uncover facts methodically and without bias. Until the official investigation is concluded and the final report is published, any speculation — especially of such a grave nature — is unacceptable and must be condemned,” ICPA said, calling on media and public commentators to act with restraint, empathy, and respect for due process.","Pilots' union slams ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122423964,imgsize-1785791,width-400,resizemode-4/122423964.jpg"

Metabolic Syndrome & Obesity: What You Need to Know

NAGPUR: The jalebi might soon come with a guilt trip. The samosa, a side of shame. And your chai biscuit? A health warning on the wall behind it.The health ministry has ordered all central institutions, including AIIMS Nagpur, to install ""oil and sugar boards"" - vivid posters spelling out how much hidden fat and sugar lurk in everyday snacks. It's a first step toward treating junk food like tobacco.The boards aim to act as quiet but pointed reminders in govt institutions, alerting citizens to the sugar and oil content in snacks considered cultural staples. A laddoo, a vada pav, a pakora - all under scrutiny. AIIMS Nagpur officials confirmed the directive. Cafeterias and public areas will soon display the warnings. ""It's the beginning of food labelling becoming as serious as cigarette warnings,"" said Amar Amale, president of Cardiological Society of India's Nagpur chapter. ""Sugar and trans fats are the new tobacco. People deserve to know what they're eating.""Govt's internal note draws a sharp line under the country's growing obesity crisis. More than 44.9 crore Indians are projected to be overweight or obese by 2050 - placing the country second only to the US. Already, one in five urban adults is overweight. The rise in childhood obesity, driven by poor diet and low activity, deepens the concern.""This is not about banning food,"" said senior diabetologist Sunil Gupta. ""But if people knew that one gulab jamun might contain five teaspoons of sugar, they might think twice before going for seconds."" Doctors and health advocates see this as part of the broader war on non-communicable diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, many of which are linked to diet.Nagpur will be among the first to reflect that shift - not with bans, but with bold, visual nudges.

NEW DELHI: India and Saudi Arabia witnessed the signing of long-term agreements between leading Sauidi mining company Ma'aden and Indian companies, IPL, KRIBHCO and CIL, for supply of 3.1 million MT of DAP (diammonium phosphate) fertiliser per annum for five years, with likely extension of another five years with mutual consent.The agreements were signed during Union minister for fertilisers and chemicals J P Nadda's ongoing ""landmark"" visit to Saudi Arabia.Indian officials said this represents a substantial increase in the availability of the crucial DAP fertiliser, ensuring the goal of food security in the medium to long term. China is one of the countries India has been dependent on for DAP supplies, and the govt is looking to reduce its reliance on the country for what is the most used fertiliser in India after urea.Without naming China, a source said that at a time when some countries are showing a restrictive approach in fertiliser supply, the commitment from Riyadh demonstrates that India's friends and partners continue to work closely to deliver requirements and collaborate on future investments.Indian officials said Nadda's visit provided a further impetus to the expanding strategic partnership with Saudi, following the State Visit of PM Modi to Jeddah in April.""Both sides underscored their commitment to broadening the scope of bilateral relations to include other key fertilisers such as urea along with DAP, aiming to ensure India's fertiliser security. Talks were also held on facilitating mutual investments, with a focus on exploring opportunities for Indian PSUs to invest in audi fertiliser sector, and reciprocally, Saudi investments in India,"" said an official.","India and Saudi Arabia witnessed the signing of long-term agreements between leading Sauidi mining company Ma'aden and Indian companies.

NEW DELHI: Excessive salt consumption is fuelling a silent epidemic in India with people at increased risk of hypertension, stroke, heart disease, and kidney disorders, according to scientists from ICMR's National Institute of Epidemiology.The scientists have initiated a community-led salt reduction study to address the issue and are focusing on low-sodium salt substitutes.While the World Health Organisation recommends less than 5 grams of salt per person per day, studies show that urban Indians consume around 9.2 grams/day, and even in rural areas, it is around 5.6 grams/day - both higher than recommended. One promising tool in this effort is low-sodium salt substitutes -- blends where part of the sodium chloride is replaced with potassium or magnesium salts, Dr Sharan Murali, a senior scientist at National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) and principal investigator of the study, said. ""Lesser sodium consumption helps reduce blood pressure and improves overall heart health, making low-sodium alternatives a meaningful switch, especially for those with hypertension,"" Dr Murali stated.""Just switching to low-sodium salt can lower blood pressure by 7/4 mmHg on average, a small change with a big impact,"" Dr Murali said.To tackle the issue of high salt consumption, the NIE has launched a three-year intervention project in Punjab and Telangana, supported by the Indian Council of Medical Research. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of structured salt reduction counselling in reducing blood pressure and sodium intake among individuals with hypertension, senior scientist at NIE, Dr Ganesh Kumar, who is also a part of the study, said.","Excessive salt consumption is fuelling a silent epidemic in India.

BARAMULLA: As the J&K government dismantles the terror ecosystem by going after terrorists and overground workers (OGWs), it has embarked on a parallel journey to honour, compensate and reward families destroyed by terrorists with wanton killings of their kin, only because they stood up to them or refused to join or help them.J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday distributed the first batch of job appointment letters to the next-of-kin (NOK) of around 50 families who had seen terrorists brutally snuff the life out of their father, mother, brother or sister, in many cases their sole breadwinner, since the onset of terrorism in J&K.The accounts of NOKs of the terror-hit families who were given job letters by the LG - ironically, coinciding with J&K Martyrs' Day - are horrific. One of them was Abida Bano's family from Kupwara. Abida, who was just 15 years old, was killed in firing by terrorists on July 22, 2003, because her family refused to open the door when they had come looking for information.At the function was also Raja Begum from Kupwara who had seen her husband and three children gunned down by terrorists in 1999 only because the family believed in staying away from conflict.There were also families of three friends - Haseeb Khan, 20, Irfan Sheikh, 22 and Mohd Asgar Sheikh, 24 - who were killed by LeT terrorists at point blank range in Baramulla in 2018 after they were used as pawns in a war they never joined.For years, NOKs had to face social isolation and economic hardship, running from pillar to post to get compensation or a job due to them. In many cases, police did not even register an FIR; terrorists forced some to vacate their properties. Ironically, the very terrorists who destroyed these families were hailed as freedom fighters with local politicians attending their mass funerals until five to six years back. Even terror OGWs were appointed by past dispensations to posts in the J&K administration and police.Sheetal Sen, whose brother Hansraj was gunned down by terrorists in Kishtwar in 2001, told TOI, ""Since then I have run from pillar to post for a job. I was turned away each time asking to get some document or the other. But LG Manoj Sinha acknowledged our hardship and has given me a job in health department.""The latest scheme to assist and facilitate NOKs of terror victims, finalised by Sinha in consultation with the UT administration and police, offers four benefits focused on 'justice and jobs'. These include jobs or self-employment avenues to NOK; financial compensation due to them under MHA guidelines; filing and pursuing police FIRs where justice was denied; restoration of properties taken away from these families by the terrorists.NOKs will be handheld by the J&K administration to start self-employment ventures with PM Mudra loans that now have a Rs 20 lakh limit.","J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday distributed the first batch of job appointment letters to the next-of-kin (NOK) of around 50 families.

Supreme Court Asks EC to Consider Aadhaar, Ration, Voter ID for Bihar Voter Roll Revision

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

In an aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore), highlighting the fierce talent war in AI recruitment today. Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world, even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts. Instead, they typically include:Industry insiders say this is only the beginning.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago. Sunak will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122344635,imgsize-21572,width-400,resizemode-4/122344635.jpg"

HYDERABAD: A 44-year-old businessman from Gandhinagar lost 3.24 crore to fraudsters posing as stock trading advisors of a private company.Based on the complaint of the victim, a case was registered by the Telangana State Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB) on Friday.On May 28, the businessman received a message from an unknown number inviting him to a WhatsApp group run by fraudsters posing as 'Prisha Singh' and 'Purav Jhaveri'. For six weeks, the duo posted market tips, block-trade charts, and invitations to participate in upcoming initial public offerings, claiming privileged access to the institutional quota for high net-worth clients.The victim fell for the tricks and downloaded a trading application shared through a private link. He began wiring money for assured IPO allotments.He transferred 3.24 crore from three personal accounts to 20 beneficiary accounts held in various banks between May 30 and July 9. The fraudsters allowed a single withdrawal of 5 lakh on June 20 to bolster credibility, a TGCSB official said.Till that withdrawal, the victim had only transferred about 75 lakh. After the withdrawal, he transferred 1.49 crore more till July 4, taking the total investment to 2.24 crore.""On 8 July, the amount shown in my app was 30 crore, and I attempted to liquidate it. Though the app showed the payout as successful, no amount reached my bank account. When I contacted the customer support number, the fraudsters demanded a 15% clearance fee, even offering a loan to cover the charge,"" the victim said. Desperate to encash the money he made, the victim transferred 1 crore more in a span of two days. As the fraudsters sought further deposits citing SEBI inspection charges, the victim contacted the national cyberfraud helpline on July 10 and filed a written complaint with TGCSB on July 11.A case was registered under Sections 318(4) 319(2) 338 of BNS and 66D of the IT Act.",A 44-year-old businessman from Gandhinagar lost 3.24 crore to fraudsters posing as stock trading advisors of a private company.

NEW DELHI: In Pune, Jamaluddin bought over 2 lakh square feet of land for Rs 16 crore through complex agreements that included multiple stakeholders — among them, family members of court staff from the Chief Judicial Magistrate’s office.The deals, investigators say, were just one part of a sprawling operation involving illegal religious conversions and questionable real estate acquisitions across two states.On Saturday, UP’s Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested the 70-year-old — known in Balrampur as Hazrat Baba Jamaluddin ‘Peer Baba’ — along with his wife Nasreen, for allegedly orchestrating a religious conversion network and acquiring property worth over Rs 100 crore using forged or dubious means.In Balrampur alone, the couple is believed to have purchased land worth Rs 1.5 crore and developed it into residential and commercial structures without securing legal land-use conversion.Police say they lived near the Chand Auliya Dargah, where Jamaluddin presented himself as a Sufi spiritual leader and built a loyal following.But Jamaluddin was not always a religious figure.“He posed as a spiritual guide but was running a well-structured conversion racket,” said ADG (Law and Order) Amitabh Yash.“People were converted through emotional exploitation, pressure or allurements. We are now uncovering financial and property links as well.”Several FIRs have been lodged against the couple, and authorities suspect a wider network.The ATS is now scrutinising all land deals, especially in Pune, where the names of judicial staff families on agreement papers have raised concern. More arrests are likely as the investigation deepens.","Police say they lived near the Chand Auliya Dargah, where Jamaluddin presented himself as a Sufi spiritual leader and built a loyal following.

India Lost 1 Rafale Jet During Op Sindoor, But Pakistan Did Not Do It: Dassault CEO's Fresh Claim

Poll Should passengers receive more training on recognizing flight details? Yes, it’s important No, it's the airline's job





In a major goof-up, a Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi, his actual destination.Shahzain, the affected passenger, alleged that he was not informed that he had boarded the wrong flight despite showing his ticket to the air hostess, ARY News reported.The passenger had to travel from Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, to Karachi, the largest.According to Shahzain, two planes were parked at Lahore airport's domestic terminal gate, and he was not aware of the mistake until it was too late.He has now sent a legal notice to the carrier, accusing it of causing him distress by its negligence.He demanded that the airline cover the additional travel expenses he incurred. He also sought compensation for the inconvenience and trouble he faced.Additionally, Shahzain confirmed he did not have a passport or visa for international travel.Two hours into the flight, I questioned why the plane had not yet reached Karachi. This caused panic among the crew, who then blamed me for the mistake,"" he said, adding that when he asked to be taken to Karachi, he was told it would take two to three days.""I was told that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) would conduct an inquiry to which I assured to cooperate,"" he further stated.The Pakistan Airport Authority has already taken notice of the incident, with the Lahore Airport Management holding the airline responsible.The manager said that the passenger's arrival in Jeddah instead of Karachi was a result of the carrier's 'negligence and carelessness'.He noted that a request for action has been submitted to the authorities.","A Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi.

If you have dedicated time and effort to helping others, whether through volunteering, medical aid, education, or supporting charitable causes, the UAE now offers a clear opportunity for long-term residency.The UAE has long been known for its rapid development and forward-looking policies. Over the past year, its Golden Visa program, originally focused on investors and entrepreneurs, has expanded its coveted Golden Visa to embrace a different kind of capital: humanitarian service.Volunteers, aid workers, and philanthropists, often unsung, mobile, and working across borders, now have a place to call home, with security and status to match. This development reflects the country’s commitment to supporting those who serve communities and contribute to social development, providing them with greater stability and recognition.Launched in 2019, the Golden Visa is a long-term residency program designed to attract and retain global talent. Originally targeting property investors, business owners, and individuals with substantial capital, the visa has since evolved into one of the most inclusive and strategic residency schemes in the world.Today, the Golden Visa is available to over ten categories of individuals, including frontline health workers, scientists, engineers, artists, athletes, and now, humanitarian contributors and volunteers.The visa comes with a powerful suite of benefits that distinguish it from traditional permits in the region:This framework ensures stability, not only for entrepreneurs and investors, but for those whose work uplifts the vulnerable and underserved.The UAE’s expansion of the Golden Visa to the humanitarian sector is not symbolic, it’s systematic. This dedicated pathway recognizes the invaluable impact of volunteers, nonprofit workers, and humanitarian pioneers, and ensures that their presence in the country is secure and celebrated.The goal is clear: to integrate socially committed individuals into the UAE’s social fabric, where they can continue serving communities without the administrative friction of short-term visas or professional instability.By doing so, the UAE is not only acknowledging their contributions, it’s also amplifying them.According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Golden Visa for humanitarian contributors has clearly defined eligibility criteria. Applicants considered ""pioneers"" in humanitarian fields must demonstrate significant involvement in recognized charitable, volunteer, or community-based work. You may be granted the full 10-year Golden Visa, if you fall under one of the following categories:This category of elite humanitarian efforts reflects the UAE’s philosophy that humanitarianism is not a hobby, it’s a lifelong vocation worthy of permanence and prestige.Unlike broad or vague interpretations, the UAE has clearly outlined the sectors it considers essential within the humanitarian landscape. These areas represent critical needs both locally and globally, and those contributing within them are eligible for Golden Visa consideration.These sectors are not only vital to global sustainability but also reflect the UAE’s own national priorities in development, aid, and long-term resilience.To ensure credibility and measurable impact, the UAE has identified a number of recognized humanitarian organizations whose volunteers may qualify for the Golden Visa. These institutions play a vital role in both domestic and international aid efforts, and affiliation with them significantly strengthens any application.For a complete directory, applicants are encouraged to refer to the Ministry of Community Development’s official list of accredited charitable organizations.Applying for the Humanitarian Visa or Golden Visa for Volunteers involves submitting proof of your involvement in recognized humanitarian or volunteer work, along with identification and endorsement documents from UAE-registered organizations. Applications are processed through official government portals such as the ICA or GDRFA, depending on the emirate.Applicants must pay processing fees, which generally range from AED 3,000($816.77) to AED 5,000($1,361.28), and undergo routine checks like medical and security clearances. Processing times typically take a few weeks.Renewals are required every 5 to 10 years, depending on the visa type, and visa holders must continue active humanitarian involvement and maintain good standing with relevant organizations and UAE laws to remain eligible.The UAE’s extension of long-term residency to humanitarian contributors aligns with its broader commitment to global humanitarian efforts. Over the past two decades, the country has become a leading donor of aid relative to its GDP, supporting disaster relief in regions like Turkey, Syria and addressing hunger through large-scale meal campaigns.The UAE has also developed key institutions such as Dubai Cares, Noor Dubai Foundation, and the International Humanitarian City, which play important roles in education, health, and aid logistics. Domestically, initiatives like the Volunteer Emirates platform encourage community engagement, reflecting the country’s belief that humanitarian work begins at home.",The UAE’s Golden Visa now covers humanitarian workers and volunteers.

Trade war: Canada reacts after Donald Trump slaps 35% tariffs; will US soften its stance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-war-canada-reacts-after-donald-trump-slaps-35-tariffs-will-us-soften-its-stance/articleshow/122378603.cms,"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday vowed to defend Canadian workers as the August 1 tariff deadline approaches. This response comes after US President Donald Trump announced a steep hike in duties on a broad range of Canadian imports to 35%, a move that deepens tensions between the two longtime allies.Sharing a post on X, Carney said, ""Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1.""He also highlighted Canada's efforts in tackling the fentanyl crisis, a key issue raised by the Trump administration to justify new tariffs.""Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries,"" he said.""We are building Canada strong. The federal government, provinces and territories are making significant progress in building one Canadian economy. We are poised to build a series of major new projects in the national interest. We are strengthening our trading partnerships throughout the world,"" he added.In a letter to Carney, Trump said the 35% tariff hike builds on the 25% duties imposed in March, and will take effect from August 1. The US claims the move is meant to pressure Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling, despite Canada's limited role in the drug's trafficking.""Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a tariff of 35% on Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all sectoral tariffs. As you will recall, the United States imposed Tariffs on Canada to deal with our Nation’s Fentanyl crisis, which is caused, in part, by Canada’s failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our Country. Instead of working with the United States, Canada retaliated with its own Tariffs,"" Trump said in his letter on his Truth Social.Trump also warned against retaliatory measures from Ottawa, saying any additional tariffs imposed by Canada would be matched and added on top of the existing 35%. However, he offered an olive branch of sorts, urging Canadian companies to relocate production to the US.""As you are aware, there will be no Tariff if Canada, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely — In other words, in a matter of weeks. If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 35% that we charge,"" he added.Although Trump sent similar tariff letters to multiple countries this week, Canada, the US's second-largest trading partner after Mexico, has become a particular target.Ottawa has pushed back with retaliatory tariffs and rejected Trump’s provocative remarks about making Canada the ""51st state.""While Mexico has also been hit with 25% tariffs over fentanyl, it has not received the same level of public criticism from Trump.Carney, who was elected prime minister in April on a platform of defending Canadian interests, has since moved to reduce Canada's dependence on the US by strengthening ties with Europe and the UK.Just hours before Trump's letter was released, Carney posted a photo with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on X, writing, ""In the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.""","US President Donald Trump announced a steep hike in duties on a broad range of Canadian imports to 35%.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

Ganga Aarti in Canada helps Indian diaspora reconnect with roots, amid debate

In a moving celebration of Indian spirituality, the Indian diaspora in Canada recently hosted a grand Ganga Aarti on the banks of the Credit River in Mississauga, echoing the sacred rituals performed in Varanasi, Rishikesh, and Haridwar. The event, organized by Radio Dhishum and attended by the Indian Consulate in Toronto, brought together scores of devotees clad in traditional attire. It was a profound display of cultural pride and community bonding far from home. While the ceremony was widely praised online, it also stirred debate over environmental concerns and the appropriateness of replicating sacred Indian rituals abroad.The Ganga Aarti was conducted in full ceremonial fashion by Radio Dhishum, a Canadian radio platform promoting Indian culture. The presence of Consul Sanjeev Saklani from the Indian Consulate in Toronto added official recognition to the event. Sharing visuals on X (formerly Twitter), the Consulate described it as aWith incense, lamps, and river offerings, the ritual mirrored the ambience of Ganga-side aartis in India, signifying how deeply spiritual traditions are rooted within the global Indian community.The ceremony struck an emotional chord with many attendees. One participant, Priyanka Gupta, shared a viral video on Instagram, describing it as the most magical evening in her ten years of living in Canada. “Not on the ghats of Varanasi or Haridwar, but right here in Canada,” she captioned. For many, the chants ofreverberating across the Canadian park offered a rare, poignant reminder of home.The event showcased how spiritual practices can be a powerful link to identity, especially for those living thousands of miles from their native country.While many praised the event for preserving Indian culture abroad, others questioned its symbolic authenticity. Supporters celebrated the diaspora's effort to keep traditions alive.wrote one user. Another commented,However, the event also drew criticism. Some online users felt performing Ganga Aarti outside India, especially in a different ecological and cultural setting, diminished its religious sanctity. One comment read, “There is a reason it is called Ganga Aarti. Doing it in front of any river doesn’t make it the same.” Others suggested that such rituals should be practiced within their original geographic and religious context.For many Indians abroad, participating in religious ceremonies like Ganga Aarti is more than spiritual—it’s a way to reclaim cultural identity and build community. In multicultural societies like Canada, these events help younger generations connect with their roots. They also serve as moments of pride for the diaspora, illustrating how Indian traditions can flourish globally while remaining rooted in their essence.Despite the debate, the event affirmed that identity is not limited by geography. For participants, the ritual reaffirmed their spiritual values and cultural connection, regardless of the continent on which it was practiced. In addition to symbolic debates, environmental considerations surfaced. Some critics questioned whether conducting rituals near the Credit River could affect the local ecosystem. Concerns ranged from the ecological impact of offerings to fire safety regulations in public spaces. Although no specific damage was reported, the event reignited broader conversations about how to balance cultural expression with local environmental norms and civic responsibility.","The Indian diaspora in Canada recently hosted a grand Ganga Aarti on the banks of the Credit River in Mississauga.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Vanessa Bryant’s quiet Instagram nod spotlights international rescue

Vanessa Bryant showed that she didn't need a press release or a long caption to make a statement. After the terrible floods in Texas, she shared a tribute to the Mexican rescue teams—only adding a heart. With the state dealing with 129 deaths, 170 missing individuals, and $22 billion in damages, her minimalistic response stood out amidst the chaos, emphasizing how grief, empathy, and global kindness can all come together in one quiet message.In early July, Central Texas went through an extraordinary level of destruction when flash floods struck the Hill Country over the Independence Day weekend. Torrential rain—reaching 32 inches in certain areas—caused the Guadalupe River to rise nearly 26 feet in under an hour, flooding cabins and neighborhoods. The most affected area, Kerr County—including the beloved Camp Mystic—lost 27 campers and counselors, while recovery efforts across the state confirm at least 129 fatalities, with about 170 people still unaccounted for.The Mexican rescue teams were instrumental in the response efforts. Firefighters from Acuña, Mexico, sent by Fundación 911, showed up in Kerr County to lend a hand to local crews dealing with the wreckage.They contributed to saving lives and delivering necessary assistance amidst the chaos.Vanessa Bryant’s journey has been filled with deep personal loss that became public due to tragedy. In 2020, she faced the heartbreaking loss of her husband Kobe and daughter Gianna, channeling her sorrow into action through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation and her wider charitable legacy. In January, her foundation gave away over 8,000 pieces of clothing to families affected by wildfires in Los Angeles. Therefore, when she shared the highlight of the Mexican rescue with just a heart emoji, it was not just a simple gesture — it was a meaningful acknowledgment of humanitarian bravery and togetherness.Numerous celebrities have come together to support Texas—Matthew McConaughey, Hilary Duff, Shakira, and the NBA community have all pledged their backing and contributed millions.

Trade chaos is forcing America's allies closer together, and further from the US. And as that happens, the European Union is trying to position itself at the centre of a new global trade map.The bloc learned this weekend that Washington would subject it to 30% tariffs starting Aug 1. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU executive branch, responded with a pledge to keep negotiating. She also made it clear that, while the EU would delay any retaliation until early Aug, it would continue to draw up plans to hit back with force.But that was not the entire strategy. Europe, like many of the US' trading partners, is also looking for more reliable friends. ""We're living in turbulent times, and when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together,"" von der Leyen said on Sunday in Brussels at a news conference alongside the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto.Just as President Trump threatens to put hefty tariffs on many countries, including Indonesia, the EU is working to relax trade barriers and deepen economic relations.""In hard times, some turn inward, toward isolation and fragmentation,"" von der Leyen said. Then, in a message implicitly extended to world leaders who have been jolted by Trump's tariffs, she added, ""You are always welcome here, and you can count on Europe.""It is a split screen that is becoming typical. On one side, the US sows uncertainty as it blows up weeks of painstaking negotiations and escalates tariff threats. On the other, the 27-nation EU and other American trading partners are forging closer ties, laying the groundwork for a global trading system that revolves less and less around an increasingly fickle US.It will be hard to move away from the US, and Prabowo predicted that America would always be a world leader. But many American trading partners now feel that they are left with little choice but to diversify.Trump has announced 30% tariffs on EU and Mexico. Canada's rate is 35%. The likes of Thailand (35%), Bangladesh (35%) and Brazil (50%), along with dozens of other US trading partners, appear to be headed for a similar fate. Trump has backed down from threatened tariffs before, and he has indicated a willingness to negotiate these tariffs down before their Aug 1 effective date - and the EU and other economies are poised to continue with negotiations. But the atmosphere is increasingly hostile.Hitting back would be just a first step; drawing closer to outside allies may prove even more meaningful in the long run.Since Trump's push to reorder the trading system kicked off in Feb, the EU has been hustling to strike new trade agreements and deepen existing ones. Canada and the EU have pulled together. Britain and the EU have had a rapprochement, five years after Britain officially exited the union. The bloc is working toward closer trading relationships with India and South Africa, and with countries across South America and Asia. Nor is the EU the only global power adopting such a strategy. Canada is also drawing closer to Southeast Asia, while Brazil and Mexico are working to deepen their ties.Officials have even floated the idea of building trading structures that exclude the US and China, which is widely blamed for supporting its factories to the point that they overproduce and flood global markets with cheap goods. Von der Leyen recently suggested that Europe could pursue a new collaboration between the bloc and a trading group of 11 countries that includes Japan, Vietnam and Australia, but that notably did not include the US or China.One key question, analysts said, is whether America's allies will go a step further. Instead of simply collaborating more with one another and leaving the US out, could they actually gang up to counter the US?","The EU is trying to position itself at the centre of a new global trade map.
