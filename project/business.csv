This has been the only statement made by her after she fled to India following unprecedented anti-govt protests that peaked on Aug 5. It was posted by her US-based son Sajeeb Wazed Joy on X.When asked whether Bangladesh has communicated its stance to India, Yunus said it has been conveyed verbally. ""Everyone understands it.

Ganesh Fest: Ganesh Festival 2024: Toll-Free Rides on Maharashtra Highways from Sept 5-19,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ganesh-fest-toll-free-rides-on-major-hways-for-15-days/articleshow/113072955.cms,"MUMBAI: In what is seen as a move to avoid embarrassment over the condition of roads during Ganpati festival, the state govt on Wednesday announced toll exemption on all public works department (PWD) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) highways across the state from Sept 5-19. But a tad arduous process of getting the exemption has raised eyebrows.A senior public works department official said a self-declaration proforma will have to be downloaded from the state govt's website, filled and pasted on thick, black paper.This will then have to be taped on the FasTag sticker outside the vehicle so that the RFID reader skips it. To err on the side of caution, motorists have been advised to tape black paper behind the FasTag sticker, too. Some officials acknowledged that with even these precautions, motorists could still be charged. ""If a FasTag sticker gets read and the toll gets deducted, one can make a cashback request through the FasTag bank account, following which the amount will be refunded,"" said a senior MSRDC official.The toll exemption directive covers all entry points of Mumbai (Vashi, Airoli, Mulund, LBS and Dahisar), barring Bandra-Worli Sea Link, NH-48 (Mumbai-Bengaluru), NH-66 (Mumbai-Goa), and other PWD and MSRDC roads. It applies to Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses as well, said a govt resolution (GR) issued on Wednesday, which said the move is targeted at devotees travelling during Ganesh festival. Samruddhi Mahamarg will also implement the GR, said officials. There was no clarity on whether MTHL is covered under the directive.Toll exemption passes will be issued to MSRTC buses with the vehicle number and driver's name. These will be coordinated by the transport department, traffic police, police and regional transport offices (RTO) and made available at police stations, traffic police checkpoints and RTO offices. The passes will also be valid for the return journey, the GR said.","The state govt on Wednesday announced toll exemption on all public works department (PWD) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) highways from Sept 5-19.

VARANASI: The serpentine lanes of Varanasi's Lallapura neighbourhood wear a badge of honour distinct from the halo of spirituality that crowns this ancient city on the banks of the Ganga.In the many small dwellings that dot Lallapura, artisans sit cross-legged on the floor and work on panelled looms for hours to create bespoke military badges and regimental insignias that sit regally on the epaulettes, berets, collars and cuffs of armed forces across continents.""We count the British royals among our clients,"" says Shadab Alam, who runs one of the more famous outlets there with his father Mumtaz Ali.""Our family has been engaged in this trade for three generations.

The appreciation we get for our work brings satisfaction and motivation.""Supplies are routed through exporters based in Delhi, Mumbai and a few other cities each month.

His father Mumtaz takes pride in the fact that clients speak highly of the quality of their products.Besides military badges, artisans of Lallapura also receive orders from fashion houses to create customised items. The primary materials that go into the making of badges and insignias are zari, a combination of gold and silver threads, and silk.The craft got a boost in 2014 when zardozi was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag.""GI certification provides legal safeguards for traditional knowledge and enables artisans to market their work better,"" says GI expert and Padma Shri winner Rajani Kant.","Lallapura has about 200 artisans skilled in making hand-embroidered military and royal emblems, crests, insignias for uniforms, cap badges, trimmings, and other decorative elements.

Forces poised to shed more 'vestiges of colonial era',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forces-poised-to-shed-more-vestiges-of-colonial-era/articleshow/113105127.cms,"NEW DELHI: After taking several steps in line with the government’s directive to shed “vestiges of the colonial era” and “Indianise” military traditions and customs, ranging from junking of western tunes in the Beating Retreat ceremony to the introduction of kurta-pyjamas in naval messes, the armed forces are now poised for some more measures.The country’s military brass not only discussed theatre commands, modernization and regional and geopolitical threats during the two-day joint commanders conference (JCC), but also apparently dwelt upon the need to create a new legacy in the 14-lakh strong armed forces.Defence minister Rajnath Singh , in fact, released a publication on ‘Colonial Practises and the Armed Forces - A Review’ during the conference in Lucknow , which was attended by chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan , the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs, and the commanders-in-chief of all the 17 single-service and two tri-service commands in the country.“The publication outlines the methodology and means to create a new legacy in the armed forces based on indigenous customs, traditions, values and thought. It has also highlighted specific leftover vestiges of colonial symbols and traditions which have been discarded and replaced with Indian practices,” a senior officer told TOI.Citing PM Modi’s enunciation of the ‘Panch Pran (five pledges)’, including 'Gulami ki Mansikta Se Mukti' (freedom from slavery mentality), to ensure India becomes a developed country by 2047, the officer said the armed forces are but a microcosm of the larger Indian society.The soldiers, sailors and airmen carry their societal values, vision and aspirations into the armed forces. “Being the most conservative and traditions based service, the armed forces require a larger and deeper effort to discard the shackles of archaic thinking and emerge free of colonial influences,” he said.Several serving military officers and veterans, however, feel that such relentless drives, policies and seminars are unnecessarily diverting the attention of the armed forces from the clear and present danger posed by China and its expanding military collusiveness with Pakistan. “The focus should only be on modernization and training for future wars,” an officer said.Another officer questioned the operational utility of the `Udbhav’ project of the Army, which seeks to integrate India’s ancient strategic acumen with contemporary military practices, for instance, in the era of AI-based swarm drones and advanced unmanned combat, space and cyber warfare, ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons. “The armed forces should be looking at the future, instead of being forced to dwell on the past,” he said.","The country’s military brass discussed theatre commands, modernization and regional and geopolitical threats during the two-day joint commanders conference (JCC) Defence minister Rajnath Singh released a publication on ‘Colonial Practises and the Armed Forces - A Review’ during the conference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113105141,imgsize-1862169,width-400,resizemode-4/113105141.jpg"

Future ties with India

On attacks on Hindus

NEW DELHI: Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday expressed his displeasure with former prime minister Sheikh Hasina 's political remarks made from India.In a recent interview with PTI, Yunus said that Hasina's statements are an ""unfriendly gesture"" and that she must remain silent until Dhaka requests her extradition .""If India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh (government) wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet,"" he said.""No one is comfortable with her stance there in India because we want her back to try her. She is there in India and at times she is talking, which is problematic. Had she been quiet, we would have forgotten it; people would have also forgotten it as she would have been in her own world. But sitting in India, she is speaking and giving instructions. No one likes it. It is not good for us or for India. There is discomfort regarding it,"" he added.While stressing Bangladesh's desire to keep strong ties with its neighbour, Yunus also advised India to refrain from framing everybody except Hasina as Islamist.""The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only,"" Yunus said.""India is captivated by this narrative. India has to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is another neighbour,"" he added.Speaking about future ties with India, the Nobel laureate said there are demands for a relook at certain treaties such as transit and the Adani electricity deal.""Everybody is saying that it is needed. We will see what is on paper and, second, what is actually happening on the ground. I can't answer it specifically. If there is any need to review, we will then raise questions about it,"" he said.Earlier, the BNP vowed to review and re-evaluate the ""questionable"" Adani electricity deal signed during the Awami League regime, as it is putting ""tremendous pressure"" on the people of Bangladesh.Yunus refuted alleged violence against minorities in Bangladesh and claimed that India's concerns were 'exaggerated' .""The issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse,"" he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address expressed hope that the situation in violence-hit Bangladesh would return to normal soon and said that 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and minorities in the neighbouring country.On August 5, Bangladesh plunged into a political crisis after PM Sheikh Hasina suddenly fled to India after weeks of nationwide protests turned violent in which at least 300 people were killed.The protests, initially ignited by students opposing a government employment quota system, rapidly evolved into widespread demonstrations against Hasina's administration due to allegations of corruption, economic mismanagement, and harsh crackdown on dissent.

Captain Devi Sharan’s other tryst with danger with the pilot who flew IC 814 back home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/captain-devi-sharans-other-tryst-with-danger-with-the-pilot-who-flew-ic-814-back-home/articleshow/113083755.cms,"ki haal hai (

NEW DELHI: Captain Devi Sharan — the captain of hijacked IC 814 in Dec 2019 — and Captain S P S Suri — the pilot flew the hijacked aircraft of erstwhile Indian Airlines back home on Jan 1, 2000, — had another tryst with danger 12 years later. This time the two and their cabin crew member colleagues got stuck in civil-war torn Libya and were waylaid by AK 47-totting youngsters on the streets of the city.Luckily, they escaped unhurt.India had launched “Operation Safe Homecoming” in Feb 2011 to evacuate its citizens fleeing the Libyan civil war. Captains Sharan and Suri had operated an Air India Airbus A330 to Sabha in Libya which got grounded on arrival due to a snag. “The city, and the entire country, was seeing serious unrest. Somehow escorts were arranged to take us from the airport to an abandoned hotel in the city. There was no staff there and we had to search for something to eat in the kitchen,” Captain Suri, now retired, told TOI. Captain Sharan still flies for AI, now the Boeing 787.Captain Sharan had also spoken to TOI about this episode in an interview three years ago.“The next day, again with armed escorts, we went to the city to look for food. On the way, we were stopped by armed people and asked to lie down on the road. Our escorts explained that we were airline staff from India and had got stuck there. Then the machine gun-totting youngsters let us go,” said Suri. The food hunt did not go well either — there was only camel meat in the market which the Indian crew did not take. Indian diplomats arranged pizzas, again only tuna fish pizzas with no veg option to be found, for them.Two days later when a replacement part was sent for the grounded aircraft and the same was fir to fly, the two daredevil pilots took off for what was to be a nonstop flight to Delhi. This journey was also not without its share of last-minute surprises.“Enroute, Lebanon refused us overflying. We had to turn back and then took Egypt permission to overfly. Then we went to Saudi Arabia; took a fuelling halt in Jeddah and then came to Delhi,” recalled Suri. The two pilots go back a long way and their chemistry helped come out of this situation too. This had happened when the 2011 cricket World Cup, which India won, was between Feb 19 and April 2, 2011. India had won that cup.On the fateful Dec 2019, Captain Sharan and Captain Suri had taken off almost simultaneously from Dubai (for Kandahar) and Sharjah (for Calicut), respectively, in the early hours of Christmas. “We had come to know about IC 814 hijacking while on the ground in Sharjah. While operating these flights, I spoke to Captain Sharan on RT (radio telephony) and asked himhow are you. He had replied, ‘Sir, I can’t talk’,” Suri said.On landing in Delhi from Calicut later that day, Captain Suri from the airport left for Kandahar along with a team of officials and IA staff including Captain J R D Rao whose bravery he recalls with tremendous admiration.On Dec 31, 1999, everyone onboard IC 814 including Captain Sharan were flown back to Delhi. Captain Suri, J R D Rao and two others stayed in Kandahar as they were to fly the hijacked Airbus A330 back home, which they did the next morning in true daredevil style. The old saying luck favours the brave proved to be correct for them.“On Jan 1, we decided to give it a try and start the engines of IC 814 without any ground power. Luckily the engine started with a growl after seven days and we started taxiing. The Kandahar air traffic control asked us to stop and told us we did not have take off clearance. There was a fuel bowser close to our aircraft and I was worried one side wing of the aircraft might hit it. Captain Rao, who had a sore throat and could barely speak, told me, ‘keep going)Suri said.They took off from Kandahar with Afghan ATC shouting they did not have permission to do so. Shortly thereafter they entered Pakistan airspace, where also they were told they did not have the same. “I just kept saying hello, hello, can’t hear or something like that. We had butterflies in out stomach that Pakistan will scramble jets and force us to land. That did not happen.”The four members heaved a sigh of relief when they heard from “alpha control” — Amritsar ATC welcome IC-814 D (delayed) to India and tell them they had a straight routing clear for India.","Captain Devi Sharan was the captain of hijacked IC 814 in Dec 2019. Captain S P S Suri flew the hijacked aircraft of erstwhile Indian Airlines back home on Jan 1, 2000.

This is despite a gazette notification of the NMC in Aug last year that reiterated that the commission would continue to follow the Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, which give patients the right to an appeal against state council decisions.The Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) of the NMC had issued a gazette notification on Aug 23, 2023 stating that the NMC ""hereby adopts and makes effective with immediate effect the Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, as if the same have been made by the commission by virtue of the powers vested under the NMC Act , 2019"". It goes on to reiterate: ""That for removal of doubt, it is clarified the Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 shall come into force with immediate effect"".Section 8.8 of the 2002 regulations states: ""Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council.""However, a patient in Chennai who filed an appeal recently against the state medical council decision in a case of alleged medical negligence was told by NMC that ""as per existing NMC Act 2019, only registered medical practitioners can apply on first appeal in NMC"". On Tuesday, the complainant was informed by the ethics section of the NMC that section 8.8 of the 2002 Regulations were abolished on Sep 25, 2020 after all the provisions of the NMC Act, 2019 came into force.This is not the first time the NMC is doing this. In response to an RTI application in 2022 seeking data on the number of patients' appeals rejected by the NMC, it admitted that 65 appeals of patients were returned from March to Sep 2022 due to their non-maintainability under section 30(3) of the NMC Act. Unlike 8.8 of the 2002 regulations, which states that anyone can appeal, this section states that ""a medical practitioner or professional who is aggrieved by any action taken by a State Medical Council"" can appeal to the EMRB.""Though the NMC has been in office for about four years, EMRB is repeatedly rejecting the appeals by patients against the state medical councils' decisions. It continues to do that despite EMRB's gazette notification reiterating that the 2002 regulations are in force, which means that patients have a right to appeal. The NMC is continuing the illegality of rejecting patients' appeals and the health ministry is not intervening to put a stop to this,"" said Dr Babu KV, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist who has been pursuing the issue of patient's right to appeal being taken away.","The board of the National Medical Commission (NMC) dealing with complaints against doctors continues to reject appeals of patients against state medical councils.

He said such linkages compound the suspicions about her ability to function as an independent regulator in view of past allegations.Chakravarty said 500 Sebi employees have openly termed the working environment in the market regulator as ""toxic and fearful"", but Sebi reacted by running down the employees as motivated by outsiders. He said Sebi is demeaning its own officers, and challenged it to sack the employees if they could be motivated by outside entities.Recalling the allegations that Buch was receiving ""salary"" and ""income"" from ICICI Bank as Sebi member and chair, the Congress functionary said it was intriguing that the lender chose to speak on her behalf while the latter stayed away from commenting. He said it was starkly different from the past when ICICI Bank had responded to allegations against its CEO Chanda Kochar by ordering an independent inquiry, which later found her culpable.Chakravarty differentiated between ""salary"", that Congress had used in its allegations, and ""income"", and said Puri's earnings from ESOPs were from ICICI whose stocks are regulated by Sebi, which demonstrates a ""clear conflict of interest"".As a former finance professional, Chakravarty said he has received several calls from foreign investors who raised questins about the integrity of the market regulator.

Sonu , a 23-year-old food delivery rider , embarks on a daily odyssey spanning hundreds of kilometres with his two-year-old son, Sarthak, nestled by his side.The story of this father-son bond began in Bihar, where Sonu shouldered responsibilities at the tender age of six, juggling work and education to support his family.Love led him to Delhi in 2019 after he married Nancy against the wishes of both their parents. Equipped with nothing but hope, he started life toiling as a labourer for a meagre Rs 200 a day, then became a security guard, and finally has been a delivery rider for the past three years. Early this year, Nancy returned to her hometown, entrusting the child to Sonu's care.Since then, every day is a battle for the youth. Yet every kilometre of riding on his rented Yulu bike propels him closer to his dream of securing a brighter tomorrow for Sarthak. ""I just want my son to go to school soon, to study and pursue his dreams, to play with friends and be hopeful about a future where he gets a fair chance at life,"" the young father confided.After doing the rounds of the city the entire day, Sonu manages to earn Rs 500. But the smiles on Sarthak's face at the end of the day further ignite his determination to persevere in this work. Sonu works over 12 hours a day, finding fleeting solace in conversations with Sarthak while resting on footpaths or in parks. His deepest aspiration is for a day when he and his son can take time off together — to play, eat and simply cherish each other's company.The daily dilemma of bringing Sarthak to work or leaving him unattended weighs heavily on Sonu's heart. He dreads the perils of traffic, accidents, pollution and dust, hazards he wishes he could shield his son from. Opening up to TOI, he told of the difficulties of balancing his role as a food delivery rider with being his kid's carer: ""There have been times when stray dogs have chased my bike and I've had to protect my son while dealing with the threat. I've even been bitten by dogs, yet I continue to make deliveries, all the while trying to keep my son safe.""Sonu's earnings as a delivery rider are dependent solely on the number of orders he completes. He, therefore, cannot make compromises. He has to maximise his deliveries to ensure there's sufficient money to provide for his family. He said, ""There have been times when I struggled to afford food for myself, yet I always prioritised meals for my son. My wife, even during her pregnancy, worked tirelessly as a house help to contribute to our household expenses. Now that she has returned to our village, I am determined to step up and shoulder an equal share of the responsibility for raising our child.""Exhaustion and fear wrestle with love and responsibility, but Sonu soldiers on, his fuel being the prospect of a bright future for his two-year-old.","Sonu is a 23-year-old food delivery rider in Delhi.

"Eye on China, India & Singapore talk SCS, Quad; chip deal to boost ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-india-singapore-talk-scs-quad-chip-deal-to-boost-ties/articleshow/113103820.cms,"India and Singapore upgraded bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership as PM Narendra Modi held talks with his counterpart Lawrence Wong to boost cooperation in a range of areas from advanced manufacturing and digitalisation to skills and healthcare. Four MoUs were signed, including one for establishing a semiconductor ecosystem partnership that was hailed as a major takeaway from Modi’s first visit to the country in 6 years.Amid growing concerns over Chinese assertiveness, the leaders also reaffirmed in a joint statement the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, security, stability, safety and freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea ( SCS ). Agreeing that regional security and stability is essential for the growth of both nations, they called for pursuing peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 UNCLOS, without resorting to the threat or use of force.Interestingly, and probably for the first time, an India-Singapore joint statement specifically mentioned not just SCS but also Quad as both nations welcomed Quad’s support for ASEAN centrality, including its agenda to support priorities and needs of countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and explored synergies for mutually beneficial cooperation. This follows the recent threat of a military conflict between China and the Philippines in SCS. A non-claimant country in SCS disputes, Singapore has traditionally avoided taking sides in the US-China rivalry in Southeast Asia, balancing its ties with Beijing with robust military and security cooperation with the US. Singapore’s remarks with India on SCS and Quad also followed a joint naval exercise with China this week that underscored its “longstanding and friendly” defence ties with Beijing.India and Singapore are looking to enhance bilateral cooperation through advanced manufacturing, with focus on semiconductors. Modi and Wong also visited AEM, a leading Singapore company in semiconductor and electronics sector. Singapore is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, accounting for over 10 percent of international semiconductor market.“Both Prime Ministers agreed that advanced manufacturing, particularly in developing resilient semiconductor supply chains, can be a new pillar of bilateral cooperation,” said a joint statement. MoUs were signed for cooperation also in healthcare, skill development and digitisation, affirming common interests in AI and cyber security.“Singapore is an important pillar of our Acr East Policy. Our common trust in democratic values links us. We will continue to work with Singapore for regional peace, stability and prosperity,” said Modi in his remarks after the meeting with Wong.Both PMs, according to the joint statement, reaffirmed their commitment to work together to promote peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region. “They underlined the importance of an open, inclusive, rules-based and resilient Indo-Pacific region, which promotes free trade and open markets and where differences are resolved peacefully in accordance with international law,” said the statement.Modi called for enhanced defence cooperation to address common maritime challenges and Wong thanked him for India’s “consistent” support for the Singapore Armed Forces' training in India which has elevated, he said, in both scope and scale in all domains, and welcomed India's active participation in the regional security architecture.The leaders also condemned terrorism, underlining their resolve to fight terrorist organisations. “Both Prime Ministers recognized that terrorism continues to remain the single most significant threat to peace and stability and reiterated their strong commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stressed that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever,” said the joint statement.","India and Singapore are looking to enhance bilateral cooperation through advanced manufacturing, with focus on semiconductors.

The prize is awarded by Technology Academy Finland for innovations that benefit millions of people.Baliga's invention, the insulated gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ), developed in 1980s, is estimated to have reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by over 82 gigatons (180 trillion pounds) in the past 30 years.""This award is coming at the culmination of my career as I am now retiring after 50 years, so the timing is perfect,"" he said.Born in Chennai, Baliga lived in Delhi until he was 10, then went to Bishop Cotton Boys' School in Bengaluru, before studying electrical engineering at IIT Madras. ""The IITs are extremely rigorous and difficult institutions in terms of the rigour of the classroom and practical training... During the first two years we spent a lot of time in the lab rather than in the classroom, so I learnt things other students may not learn.

Singh-Trudeau partnership



Did India's tough stance force Singh-Trudeau fallout?

NEW DELHI: Canada has been thrown into a political crisis after Jagmeet Singh 's New Democratic Party ( NDP ) withdrew its support to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, igniting speculation about the stability of Trudeau's administration and whether he will be able to weather the storm till elections in October 2025.The NDP's support was crucial for the Liberal government, allowing it to maintain power through a confidence-and-supply agreement established in 2022.This agreement was intended to last until June 2025, but Singh indicated that the decision to withdraw had been in the works for several weeks, suggesting a growing discontent with the Liberal government's performance on various promises, including healthcare reforms and affordability measures.Nevertheless, Jagmeet's decision to pull NDP support from Trudeau's minority government came as a surprise.In a video message, the Sikh leader criticised Trudeau for failing to address key issues affecting Canadians, particularly accusing him of succumbing to ""corporate greed"" and letting the public down.Stating that he had ""ripped up"" the confidence-and-supply agreement with Trudeau's party, Singh said: ""Justin Trudeau has proven again and again he will always cave to corporate greed. The Liberals have let people down. They don't deserve another chance from Canadians.""With Singh pulling support, Trudeau's government now faces significant challenges.Singh's withdrawal places the minority government at risk, as it will now need to seek support from other opposition parties, such as the Bloc Québécois, to survive confidence votes.Trudeau expressed his focus on addressing the affordability crisis and other pressing issues, asserting that he hopes the next election will not occur until the fall of 2025.He emphasised: ""These are the things that we're focused on. I'll let others focus on politics"".However, the political landscape is fraught with uncertainty.Polls indicate that the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, could secure a significant victory if elections were held imminently.Singh's announcement has prompted calls from opposition leaders for immediate elections, further complicating the situation for Trudeau.Singh's political strategy has involved maintaining ties with various Khalistani groups and individuals, including pro-Khalistan musicians and activists.His rise to leadership in the NDP coincided with a growing political alliance between the NDP and Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party, which has been accused of pandering to Khalistani voters to secure electoral support.This partnership has led to accusations that Singh's influence has compelled Trudeau to adopt a more lenient stance towards Khalistani extremism.Moreover, Singh's attendance at events like the Khalsa Day rally in Toronto, which featured pro-Khalistan chants and banners, had raised eyebrows. The event was attended by multiple political leaders, including Trudeau, and was criticised by the Indian government for allegedly allowing extremist sentiments to flourish unchecked.Singh's association with Khalistani politics has roots that extend back to his early political career.Shortly after becoming NDP leader in 2017, he faced scrutiny for his response to questions about Khalistani extremism, particularly regarding whether it was appropriate for Canadian gurdwaras to honor figures associated with violence against India, such as Talwinder Singh Parmar, the architect of the 1985 Air India bombing.His evasive responses during interviews suggested a reluctance to distance himself from the Khalistani movement, which has historically been a contentious issue within Canadian politics .Additionally, Singh's past experiences, including being denied a visa to India in 2013 due to alleged links with extremists, have shaped his political narrative. He claimed that this denial stemmed from his advocacy for justice regarding the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, which resonates with many in the Sikh community.The diplomatic relationship between India and Canada have significantly deteriorated due to New Delhi's firm stance against pro-Khalistani protests in Canada, particularly following allegations by Trudeau regarding India's involvement in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.In a notable tweet following Trudeau's allegations over Nijjar's assassination, Singh had said: ""Today we learned of allegations that agents of the Indian government murdered Nijjar - a Canadian killed on Canadian soil ... To all Canadians, this is my vow. I will leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of justice.""Singh's party has been frequently criticised in Canadian politics for its perceived leniency towards Khalistani sentiments.Trudeau's government has also faced domestic and global backlash for allegedly not taking a strong enough stance against these activities, which has led to internal political pressures.The situation has been compounded by the broader implications for Canada's diplomatic relations, as Trudeau has also been criticised for potentially jeopardising ties with India, a key player in the global arena.","Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party ( NDP ) withdrew its support to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government.

New PPF rules 2024: 3 changes from October 1 that Public Provident Fund account holders should be aware of,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/new-ppf-rules-2024-3-changes-from-october-1-that-public-provident-fund-account-holders-should-be-aware-of/articleshow/113014204.cms,"New PPF Rules 2024

1. PPF account for minor:

2.More than one PPF Account:

3. Extension of PPF account by NRI:

New PPF rules 2024: Public Provident Fund or PPF is a popular investment option, especially since it comes with government guarantee, making it risk-free with assured returns. The Ministry of Finance 's Department of Economic Affairs has recently released updated guidelines for Public Provident Fund accounts opened under the name of minors, individuals holding multiple PPF accounts, and NRIs extending their PPF accounts through post offices under the National Small Savings (NSS) schemes.The circular announcing these changes was issued on August 21, 2024, with the new regulations set to take effect from October 1, 2024.According to an ET report, the circular says, ""lt needs to be noted that the power to regularise irregular small savings accounts are vested with the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, all cases pertaining to irregular accounts should be forwarded to this division for regularisation by the Ministry of Finance.""In the case of PPF accounts opened under the name of a minor, the interest rate applicable to Post Office Savings Account (POSA) will be paid for such irregular accounts until the minor reaches the age of 18, at which point they become eligible to open their own account. From that point onwards, the standard PPF interest rate will be applied. The maturity period for these accounts will be calculated starting from the date the minor attains adulthood, i.e., the date from which they become eligible to open the account.The scheme rate of interest will be earned on the primary account as long as the deposit remains within the yearly limit. The investor chooses two accounts from any Post Office or agency bank, and after regularisation, the primary account is the one they wish to maintain.If the primary account stays below the applicable investment limit each year, the balance in the second account will be combined with it. The primary account will continue to earn the prevailing scheme rate of interest after the merger. The second account's excess balance will be returned without interest.It's important to note that apart from the primary and second accounts, all other accounts will not earn any interest from the date of opening.For NRI PPF accounts that are active and opened under the Public Provident Fund Scheme (PPF), 1968, where Form H did not explicitly inquire about the account holder's residency status, the account holder (Indian citizen who became an NRI during the currency of the account) will receive a POSA rate of interest until September 30, 2024. After that date, the aforementioned account will earn no interest.","New PPF rules 2024: Public Provident Fund or PPF is a popular investment option, especially since it comes with government guarantee, making it risk-free with assured returns.

Daniel Bryan's dominating moves: WWE Top 10, April 2, 2018

Bryan Danielson is a prominent name in wrestling today. He has achieved remarkable success through his impressive accomplishments and charismatic persona that solidified his position as a celebrated in-ring performer. Throughout his career, Danielson won numerous awards including multiple WWE Championships which is a testament to his in-ring acumen, versatility, and dynamic fight moves.His engagement in high-profile matches, intense yet dramatic feuds, and intriguing storylines are what make him a standout performer who amassed immense popularity and fame over the years. Not to mention, it is not only his professional accomplishments but also his personal life and backstage drama that have received widespread popular attention. Saying so, it needs to be mentioned that Danielson discussed an intriguing development regarding his iconic “YES” chant for which he was contacted by WWE. Let’s explore what actually happened and what he had to say regarding it.Fans of Bryan Danielson must know that the popular “YES” chant has become synonymous with the wrestling star. Recently, in his interview with Luke James Chats, Danielson explained a situation involving his signature “Yes” chant. It so happened that in late July, Danielson wanted to trademark the chant which he had used during his time in WWE.Even though the chant is strongly connected to his persona, he did not use it in the initial days of AEW. In the interview, Danielson said that explained that WWE contacted him after he filed for the trademark. The message, according to him, came across as a legal notice from the promotion. He said that his manager suggested he file for the trademark. After finding it cost-effective, he decided to go for it until he received an email from WWE. Putting it in his own words,“Well so, it’s weird. I applied for it (‘Yes’ chant trademark) but then I got — it wasn’t necessarily a cease and desist. I got some sort of legal letter from WWE (he laughed).”“Listen, listen, it’s really weird because my manager just texted me and said, ‘Hey, this thing is available. Do you wanna get it?’”“And I was like, ‘How much does it cost?’ And it wasn’t that much and I was like, ‘Okay, sure’ and then, shortly after that, I got an email from WWE saying, oh, ‘This is infringing’ on this or that or whatever and I’m like, ‘Dude, I’m not trying to sell anybody anything. I just do my thing.’”This situation proves how his past with WWE still affects his present working experience in AEW. Despite his WWE past cementing his legacy in the wrestling world, Danielson is all geared up to engage in a bout with Jack Perry on September 7, 2024, and win the AEW World Championship.",Bryan Danielson is a prominent name in wrestling today.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
