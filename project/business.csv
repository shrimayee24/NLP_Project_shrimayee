The Food Corporation of India (FCI) will go for weekly movement of the stock from Punjab to other rice consuming states.In a recent meeting with Union food minister Parhlad Joshi, Punjab CM Bhagwant Singh Mann flagged how scarcity of rice storage capacity in the state was affecting the paddy procurement from mandis and leading to farmers’ resentment. Joshi had promised to evacuate the stocks and also procure the 120 lakh tonnes of paddy from the state.Joshi on Wednesday said, “We are committed to create space and evacuating surplus rice stocks from Punjab and Haryana is our highest priority. We have submitted a plan for evacuation of foodgrain from Punjab.” Officials said options are also being explored to store some of the surplus rice in the godowns meant for wheat storage in the state.So far 23 lakh tonne of paddy has been procured from Punjab during the current marketing season, which is nearly 38% less than the 37 lakh tonnes bought last year during the same period. Punjab is the biggest contributor to the central pool of food grains stock.Sources said the Centre has given the go ahead for creating 20 lakh tonnes of additional storage capacity under the Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee Scheme . They added that the state govt will soon float tenders for this purpose.Till Tuesday, the FCI and state govt agencies have purchased 63 lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers mostly in Punjab, Haryana and Tamil Nadu. This is around 26% less than 85.2 lakh tonnes of paddy purchased in the same period last season.The FCI annually supplies around 380 lakh tonnes of rice to around 80 crore beneficiaries covered under the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana .",The Food Corporation of India (FCI) will go for weekly movement of the stock from Punjab to other rice consuming states.

"India allocates up to 4.6% of GDP in education, higher than many in region, says Unesco",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-allocates-up-to-4-6-of-gdp-in-education-higher-than-many-in-region-says-unesco/articleshow/114522433.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Between 2015 and 2024, India allocated approximately 4.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent of its GDP to education, aligning with international benchmarks set by ' Education 2030 Framework for Action', which recommends that countries allocate 4-6 per cent of their GDP to education.A new series of reports from the Unesco Institute for Statistics on world education statistics revealed that India's government expenditure on education has fluctuated between 13.5 per cent and 17.2 per cent during the same period.This range aligns with the Education 2030 target, that encourages government s to allocate 15-20 per cent of their public expenditure to education.These reports provide a detailed analysis of global education investment trends, particularly in relation to achieving sustainable development goals (SDG), especially SDG 4, which focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education.India's investment in education has remained stable, consistent with international benchmarks and has been investing more than some of its neighbours in terms of both GDP percentage and government expenditure. In comparison with other Central and Southern Asian countries, India has invested more in terms of both GDP percentage and government expenditure, contrasting with the global trend of declining average investment in education.The report notes that while South Asian countries, including Nepal and Bhutan, allocate around 4-6 per cent of their GDP to education, nations like Afghanistan and Pakistan are falling behind in terms of both expenditure and resource allocation.The report highlighted that ""as a percentage of total expenditure, the world average is in decline. Central and Southern Asia countries invest more in comparison with investment in 2010s. A decline is noted in other regions"".In 2022, India's expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP among Central and Southern Asia is lower only to Bhutan (7.5 per cent ), Kazakhstan (7.2 per cent ), Maldives (4.7 per cent ), Tajikistan (5.7 per cent ) and Uzbekistan (5.2 per cent ). Compared to the whole of Asia, India's expenditure is higher than countries like China and Japan.Globally, the world average of public expenditure on education has seen a decline, from 13.2 per cent in 2010 to 12.5 per cent in 2020, with a notable decrease following Covid-19 pandemic.","India's government expenditure on education has fluctuated between 13.5 per cent and 17.2 per cent.

"Murder-for-hire: Friend or foe, no compromise on criminal activity, says US Ambassador Eric Garcetti",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/well-be-satisfied-only-if-guilty-held-accountable-us-envoy-on-pannun-case/articleshow/114519339.cms,"Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. (Reuters)

In an exclusive interview to TOI, the US ambassador Garcetti says there’s too much at stake for both countries to not get this issue right. He also says that while the US is satisfied with the progress in the Indian probe so far, Washington will be satisfied ultimately only if accountability is ensured.

Days after US authorities announced charges against a former Indian government official, Vikash Yadav , for his alleged involvement in a murder-for-hire plot, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti told TOI in an exclusive interaction while American authorities are satisfied with progress in India’s probe into the case, Washington will be satisfied ultimately only if accountability is achieved.He said the US wants the guilty to be held accountable and not just an assurance that the crime won’t be repeated in the future.Garcetti said there’s no way the US can compromise on criminal activity, whether it comes from an enemy or a close friend. He didn’t comment on whether the US would pursue Yadav’s extradition, as he said extradition can take place only after he is arrested. The ambassador also said there’s too much at stake for India and the US to not get this case right. Asked about the impunity enjoyed by Khalistan separatists in Canada, and the threats issued by them from the US soil, Garcetti said the US takes real threats seriously and cited strong counterterrorism cooperation with India, giving the example of the Tahawwur Rana , the Mumbai attacks accused against whom, he said, India and the US have built up an “airtight” extradition case.“We have said 2 things from the beginning. This sort of behaviour is unacceptable from any country to another country. Certainly, unacceptable to us as Americans. That’s a red line, coming from an enemy or a closest friend. That’s our first responsibility, no matter who they are or what they say, to draw a line that murder-for-hire is illegal, as it is in every country,” said Garcetti.“Second, we desire accountability. Not just say it won’t happen in the future but that those who were involved will be held accountable. That’s what our prosecutors are focused on. Our prosecutors are 100 percent not political. They exist in a different universe,” he added.While expressing satisfaction with the work done so far by the Indian commission of inquiry, the ambassador said the US expects India would have criminal accountability for anyone who would break the law. “We are very satisfied that a commission of inquiry was set up. The commission is going through a formal process, as we do on dozens of cases at any point in time. Every single day, the United States and India formally ask for evidence, do joint investigations, make arrests, extraditions. We expect the same here,’’ said Garcetti.On the Indian probe committee’s recent visit to the US, the ambassador said that in Washington, there were good, deep discussions, sharing of information. “We got good feedback from the Indian committee. Our law enforcement authorities were happy to share. But ultimately, I think, people in Washington will only be satisfied when accountability is achieved. Our prosecutors have put forward evidence that merits criminal charges and that evidence can and will be shared in a proper way with the Indian investigation and I’d expect that the Indian system, just like the American system, knows that murder-for-hire plots are illegal and will hold people accountable,” said the ambassador.Garcetti didn’t predict if US authorities would seek Yadav’s extradition, but when asked if the US expects India to arrest him, Garcetti reiterated that American authorities expect accountability. “And that can happen probably in more than one way. Without accountability, justice won’t be served. I can’t speak about this individual’s criminal activities here in India but the prosecutors in the US clearly believe he was involved in a criminal conspiracy in America,” he said.Asked about whether this issue might adversely impact the India-US relationship, given the speculation here that American authorities might be acting in tandem with the Canadians, the ambassador said, “that there’s too much at stake in our relationship for us not to get this right”.“There’s no way we can compromise criminal activity and the fundamental values that murder-for-hire is illegal and that crossing borders for international murder plots is against the law. Any country’s first responsibility is defending its people’s rights, whether it’s freedom of speech or the right not to get killed. But there’s too much at stake to not get this right. I’m optimistic that we can get this right. We are collaborating, even the most difficult conversations are happening. I am confident India and America can get it right but it won’t be simple,’’ he said.When asked about India’s concerns over the impunity enjoyed by Khalistan separatists in Canada, or that Pannun could issue threats to India from the US soil, and how the US could held India address some of these issues, the ambassador cited close counter terrorism cooperation between the 2 countries, and cited the example of how they had dealt with the case involving Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana.“I’m very proud of the work we are doing together in counterterrorism. We always tell our Indian friends to focus on crimes. And when we focus on crimes, as opposed to opinions, we are able to see progress. When an Indian consulate is attacked, we launch a criminal investigation. We take the safety and security of Indian diplomats very seriously. We take terrorist acts, not words but acts, incredibly seriously. And threats on people’s lives is a crime in the US. Nobody is protected in the US against those sorts of criminal acts. For instance, in the Tahawwur Rana case, we have done everything the right way. We have worked closely together and that can result in a victory against terrorism for both India and the US as friends. We will continue to take real threats seriously,’’ said Garcetti.On whether Rana could be extradited soon, he said there’s only one step left which is appeal to the Supreme Court . “I’ll leave it to the legal experts, but everybody says this is airtight, done correctly and it would be very surprising if he were to make one more appeal. And by the way that appeal doesn’t guarantee anything. Every court has so far upheld the work that India and the US are doing together on this extradition,” he said.On charges against Yadav, Garcetti also said that in the American system, a politician or even the White House doesn’t pick up the phone and tell the prosecutor to bring charges or not. “That’s an independent decision based on the prosecutors’ belief in the evidence,” he said.Asked about India’s latest diplomatic spat with Canada over the “expulsion” of the Indian high commissioner, Garcetti described both as close friends and partners of the United States and expressed hope they can reach an understanding. “It’s something really between India and Canada. I’d hope there can be an understanding. Justice is justice. That should be clear. I think these are countries that cooperate on issues of criminal justice all the time and I’d hope that can be achieved even in difficult moments,’’ he said.","Garcetti said there’s no way the US can compromise on criminal activity, whether it comes from an enemy or a close friend. He said the US wants the guilty to be held accountable and not just an assurance that the crime won’t be repeated in the future.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114519429,imgsize-667260,width-400,resizemode-4/114519429.jpg"

No joint statement, China talks of ‘important progress’, not ‘agreement’

The landmark agreement India and China reached this week to end one of the longest military standoffs in recent times received the final seal of approval on Wednesday from PM Modi and President Xi Jinping , as the two held a bilateral meeting in Kazan after a gap of five years and endorsed the deal. This, according to the Indian side, will lead to a further easing of the situation along LAC.As the next step forward, the two agreed in their 50-minute meeting to soon have the Special Representatives (SRs) talks on the India-China boundary question, which has not taken place since 2019, and underlined the need to take relations forward from a ""strategic and long-term perspective, enhance strategic communication and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges"".The SRs - NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi - have met on several occasions on the sidelines of multilateral events, including last month in St Petersburg, but not under the SR talks format. According to an Indian readout, Modi welcomed the agreement for complete disengagement and resolution of issues that arose in 2020 in eastern Ladakh, which also led to the deadly Galwan clash that year, and underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquillity.Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said that Modi also assured Xi of India's full support to China's SCO presidency in 2025. China described the meeting as constructive and one that carried great significance.China, however, did not use the word agreement in its readout, with the spokesperson only saying that Modi and Xi commended the “important progress” that had been reached through intensive communication on relevant issues in the border areas.There was no joint statement either on the border agreement or even on the Modi-Xi meeting.“We believe that the importance of India-China relations is not just for our people. Our relations are also important for global peace, stability and progress,’’ Modi told Xi in his opening remarks, adding he was looking forward to constructive talks with an open mind.He also mentioned the 3 mutuals — mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity — that India has often said should form the basis of bilateral ties. India had maintained for the past 5 years that ties could return to normal only through restoration of peace and tranquillity along the border.Xi also told Modi that it's important for both sides to have more communication and cooperation, to properly handle differences and disagreements, and to facilitate each other’s pursuit of development aspirations.“It’s important for both sides to shoulder our international responsibility, set an example for boosting the strength and unity of developing countries, and to contribute to promoting multi-polarisation and democracy in international relations,” said Xi.Xi also said in the meeting that “specific disagreements” should not be allowed to affect the overall relationship.The agreement reached this week pertained to Demchok and Depsang areas, the 2 friction points where disengagement had not been completed.The two agreed that the SRs will meet at an early date to oversee the management of peace and tranquillity in border areas and to explore a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question, according to the Indian readout. It added that relevant dialogue mechanisms at the level of foreign ministers and other officials will also be utilized to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations.","No joint statement, China talks of ‘important progress’, not ‘agreement’ The two agreed in their 50-minute meeting to soon have the Special Representatives (SRs) talks on the India-China boundary question, which has not taken place since 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114519213,imgsize-1075412,width-400,resizemode-4/114519213.jpg"

SRINAGAR: PDP president Mehbooba Mufti reaffirmed Wednesday her stand that Union government should initiate dialogue with Pakistan , saying J&K is suffering due to hostility between two neighbours and only through reconciliation can peace and stability be achieved.This has been PDP’s stated position for long. In its assembly election manifesto, PDP advocated talks with Pakistan to address “unsettled Kashmir issue”.“People of J&K are stuck in animosity between two countries. Their lives and their property are getting destroyed because two countries are fighting each other. J&K is bearing brunt and poor non-local labourers are also suffering because of that,” Mehbooba said after visiting slain doctor Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar’s home in Nayidgam village of central Kashmir’s Budgam district.Dr Dar and six other employees of a tunnel-construction company were killed by suspected Pakistani terrorists at their campsite on Srinagar-Leh highway in Ganderbal district Sunday evening. Other victims were architectural engineer Shashi Bhushan Abrol from Jammu, three workers from Bihar — Faheem Nasir, Mohammad Hanif, and Abdul Kaleem — along with Anil Shukla from Madhya Pradesh, and Gurmeet Singh from Punjab.Ex-CM Mehbooba, who headed a PDP-BJP govt from April 2016 to June 2018, criticised Centre’s stand on dialogue with Pakistan, pointing out that mixed messages from govt further delay peace process . She said until India and Pakistan engage in meaningful dialogue, similar to peace efforts initiated during former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure, situation would only worsen.Her remarks stand in contrast with NC president Farooq Abdullah’s rhetoric after Ganderbal massacre that there can be no talks till Pakistan stops killings. Mehbooba refused comments on Abdullah’s remarks. “Every person in J&K, not just Mehbooba Mufti, wants this violence to end and that two countries sit together and talk so that we get out of this bloodshed,” she said.",Mehbooba Mufti reaffirmed her stand that Union government should initiate dialogue with Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Vikash Yadav , a former government employee now in the centre of a legal and diplomatic storm, is being made a ""scapegoat"" in international politics, said his lawyers, R K Handoo and Aditya Chaudhary.Handoo denied allegations from the US Department of Justice that Yadav had allegedly conspired to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , emphasising that Yadav has never gone to the US.""Our client was not involved in any criminal activity. He has done nothing wrong. The accusations are baseless and part of a larger international conspiracy against India,"" said Handoo.Claiming their client was innocent and was being framed, Handoo and Chaudhary said Yadav didn't even know Nikhil Gupta , his alleged co-conspirator. The US has alleged that Yadav (aka CC1) directed the assassination plot from India, providing sensitive information about Pannun to Gupta, who in turn shared it with a 'hitman' who was an undercover DEA informant. Gupta was extradited to the US from Czech Republic in June this year. He was dramatically arrested there last year at the request of the US govt.Since last summer, Yadav's life has been turned upside down. The whole episode has taken a severe toll on his personal life.After being dismissed from service, he was forced to vacate his government accommodation in a humiliating manner, Handoo revealed. ""His reputation is in tatters, and he faces a constant threat to his life. The psychological pressure has been relentless. He was subjected to mental harassment in the custody of Delhi Police ,"" Handoo told TOI.As the case unfolds, tension between India and the US over the issue persists. The FBI has issued a federal arrest warrant for Yadav, and he remains 'at large'. As the world watches as this drama plays out, wondering what's truth and what's deception, one thing is certain - his life will never be the same.","Vikash Yadav is being made a ""scapegoat"" in international politics, his lawyers say.

PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Wednesday rejected a plea to recall its order of Jan 11, 2024, consolidating all suits filed in connection with the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah dispute at Mathura.Dismissing the plea moved by the Shahi Idgah mosque side, Justice Mayank Kumar Jain said consolidating all suits would save the precious time of court and the expenses of litigants.Further, it would ensure smooth hearing and expeditious disposal, and help to avoid conflicting orders and decisions in different suits, the judge said. Justice Jain had reserved his order on Oct 16 after hearing all sides.The high court's decision means the Jan order would remain intact, allowing for a unified legal process for all the 18 cases concerning the disputed land, which holds religious significance for both Hindus and Muslims.Earlier, moving the application on behalf of the Muslim side , Tasneem Ahmadi, a Supreme Court lawyer, had submitted that consolidation of all cases would deprive them of the right to oppose each case. Besides, it had been done at a premature stage, she said, contending that the cases should not be consolidated before framing of issues and collecting evidence.Opposing the application, Hari Shankar Jain from the Hindu side submitted that consolidating the cases came under the court's discretionary power, and neither of the parties had the right to challenge the same. The only purpose of such an objection was to delay the proceedings, Jain contended. He also submitted that consolidation did not mean losing the right to contest all the cases.","Allahabad high court rejects plea to recall its order of Jan 11, 2024, consolidating all suits filed in connection with the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi- Shahi Idgah dispute at Mathura.

(Agencies)

NEW DELHI: Justice B V Nagarathna on Wednesday penned a lengthy opinion to disagree on all but one issue with the eight other judges on a bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud , and said Parliament alone is competent to exercise regulatory powers over industrial alcohol while state legislatures can do so for 'intoxicating liquor'.The majority opinion authored by CJI Chandrachud, with concurrence of seven judges, overruled the 1989 judgment in Synthetics and Chemicals case by a seven-judge bench led by Justice Nagarathna's father and then CJI E S Venkataramiah.Justice Nagarathna said the 1989 judgment merely needed a clarification, not overruling.Justice Nagarathna will become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027. It will also mark the first time a daughter has followed her father to head the country's judiciary. She will be CJI for 37 days from Sep 24 to Oct 29, 2027. Her father was CJI for six months from June 19 to November 17, 1989.CJI Chandrachud, along with his father Justice Y V Chandrachud, who was CJI for the longest-ever tenure of seven-and-a-half years, are the first father-son duo to head the Indian judiciary. Chandrachud Jr has twice overruled his father's judgments - the infamous Emergency-era ADM Jabalpur verdict in the Aug 2017 K Puttaswamy case and the 1985 judgment upholding validity of adultery as an offence in the Joseph Shine judgment in Sep 2018.Justice Nagarathna agreed on one issue with the majority opinion, which said, ""Parliament does not have the legislative competence to enact a law taking control of the industry of intoxicating liquor covered by Entry 8 of List II in exercise of the power under Article 246 read with Entry 52 of List I.""Ending her agreement there, she said Synthetics and Chemicals judgment in respect of Section 18G of the Industrial Development and Regulation Act (IRDA) correctly stated the law. ""Even with regard to 'industrial alcohol' as a product which falls within 'fermentation industries' in respect of which the Union has assumed control, in the absence of a notified order, the competence of the state to act under Entry 33 List III is denuded,"" she said.Justice Nagarathna said merely because 'industrial alcohol' can be easily manufactured into or misused to prepare 'intoxicating liquor', it would not grant states the competence to wholly regulate 'industrial alcohol'.""State legislatures only have legislative competence over what is 'intoxicating liquor' as a beverage. Therefore, the judgment in Synthetics and Chemicals is good law and was most correct in postulating that state legislatures will only have the competence to prevent misuse in interest of public health,"" she said.","Justice B V Nagarathna will become the first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027.

SC hands legislative control over molasses, grains to states

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday further expanded the scope of fiscal federalism by enabling states to exercise virtually complete legislative control over liquor production and trade, a ruling that will empower them to tax industrial alcohol , including denatured spirit and extra neutral alcohol (ENA), which were hitherto part of the sole domain of the Union govt.This ruling by a 9-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud , by eight to one majority, is the second financial bonanza for states in 3 months as the same nine-judge bench had, on July 25, entitled states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and levy tax on mineral bearing lands retrospectively from 2005, casting huge financial burden on central PSUs engaged in mining activities.On Wednesday, the judgment giving wider meaning to Entry 8 (intoxicating liquor) of State List and restricting the operation of Entry 52 (control of industries in public interest) of Central List followed the same ratio as in the July 25 mineral case ruling — CJI Chandrachud authoring the majority 123-page judgment for himself and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, S C Sharma and A G Masih and Justice B V Nagarathna penning an elaborate 241-page dissent.Importantly, the majority opinion interpreted the phrase ‘intoxicating liquor’, which is solely within the legislative purview of states, to include extra-neutral alcohol (ENA), which is produced from sugarcane molasses or grains and used in industries producing alcoholic beverages, pharmaceutics, perfumery and hand sanitiser. Centre had cited production of hand sanitiser during the Covid pandemic to urge the SC to maintain parliamentary control over ENA.The SC went to the extent of giving legislative control over sugarcane molasses and grains, which are raw material for production of alcohol, to states. It said, “Entry 8 cannot be interpreted to exclude raw material used for the production of intoxicating liquor merely because the entry does not expressly provide for them. On an application of the principle that entries ought to be interpreted widely, the raw material for the production and manufacture of intoxicating liquor, as interpreted in this judgment, will be covered by Entry 8.“Parliament under Entry 52 of List I does not have the legislative competence to enact a law taking control of the industry of intoxicating liquor. State legislatures will have control over the industry of ‘intoxicating liquor’. Parliament could not have taken control of the field covered by Entry 8 since we have interpreted intoxicating liquor to include alcohol other than potable alcohol as well.”",Ruling by a 9-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud is the second financial bonanza for states in 3 months. The same bench had entitled states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and levy tax on mineral bearing lands retrospectively from 2005.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114521097,imgsize-445523,width-400,resizemode-4/114521097.jpg"

That apart, despite our microscopic examination, we could not find any specific evidence brought out by the prosecution against the appellant herein through anyone of the witnesses.In other words, the fact discernible from the impugned judgment is that none of the prosecution witnesses had specifically deposed against the appellant herein of his having committed any cruelty which will attract the offence under Section 498-A , IPC, against him,"" it said.""There is also no case that no complaints were filed implicating the appellant earlier to the subject FIR. In short, we find that there is no scintilla of evidence against the appellant herein to hold that he has committed the offence under Section 498-A, IPC... Being the husband of the second accused, who was found guilty by the courts below for the aforesaid offence cannot be a ground to hold the appellant guilty under the said offence in the absence of any specific material on record,"" it said.",Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Kumar said he got married to the sister-in-law of the deceased after the allegation of dowry harassment was first made.

Michael Jeffries , the former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, and two others have been taken into custody on charges related to sex trafficking and interstate prostitution , according to a representative for federal prosecutors on Tuesday.The specifics of the criminal charges were not immediately disclosed. These arrests follow a series of sexual misconduct allegations spanning several years, which were made in civil lawsuits and media reports by young individuals who claimed Jeffries enticed them with offers of modeling work and then coerced them into sexual acts.In an email response, quoted by AP, Michael Jeffries' lawyer, Brian Bieber, said that he would ""respond in detail to the allegations after the indictment is unsealed, and when appropriate, but plan to do so in the courthouse — not the media.""Details regarding the legal representation for the other defendants were not readily available.Jeffries departed from Abercrombie & Fitch, headquartered in New Albany, Ohio, in 2014. A civil lawsuit filed in New York last year alleged that Abercrombie permitted Michael Jeffrie's to operate a sex-trafficking ring during his 22-year tenure. The lawsuit claimed that Jeffries employed modeling scouts to scour the internet for potential victims, and some of these aspiring models became victims of sex trafficking.Last year, Abercrombie announced that it had enlisted an external law firm to carry out an independent investigation following a BBC report that raised similar accusations. The BBC investigation included accounts from twelve men who described participating in events involving sexual activities, allegedly arranged by Jeffries and his partner, Matthew Smith . These events reportedly took place at Jeffries' New York residence as well as hotels in cities like London and Paris.","Michael Jeffries, the former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, and two others have been taken into custody on charges related to sex trafficking and interstate prostitution.

The officer said three accounts on social media platform 'X' - @adamlanza111, @psychotichuman and @schizobomer777 have been found involved in posting threat messages to airlines.

Government plans strict action against those spreading hoax messages

The Indian Ministry of Information Technology sharply criticized Elon Musk 's social media platform, X, formerly Twitter , following a surge in bomb threats received by domestic airlines. In little over a week, more than 170 flights operated by the Indian carriers have received bomb threats. Many of these were circulated through social media platforms, have led to widespread panic and disruptions to flight operations.In a virtual meeting with representatives from airlines and social media companies like X and Meta, IT Ministry officials accused Twitter of ""abetting crime"" and questioned its representatives about the measures taken to prevent the spread of these alarming rumors.The meeting was chaired by Joint Secretary, IT, Sanket S Bhondve.The online threats have created significant disruptions, forcing several flights, including international ones, to be diverted. More than 120 flights operated by Indian carriers have been affected, with Tuesday alone seeing 30 threats targeting IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India.Delhi Police has registered eight separate FIRs in connection with bomb threats to more than 90 domestic and international flights over the past one week. The affected flights are said to include Akasa, Air India, IndiGo and Vistara, operating from Delhi to various domestic and international destinations. According to a senior police officer, the threats messages were received through anonymous posts on X which were later suspended by the authorities.""It was suspected that the handler used VPN (Virtual private network) or dark web browser to set up the accounts on X and then posted the messages from more than one account,"" the officer said.In response to the crisis, Union Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu announced earlier this week that those responsible for spreading hoax threats would face severe consequences, including being placed on a no-fly list. The government is also working to amend the 'Suppression of Unlawful Acts' against the 'Safety of Civil Aviation Act' to enable action against offenders even when aircraft are on the ground. Currently, aviation security regulations primarily address in-flight offenses.Following the hoax calls, airlines have implemented standard operating procedures to ensure passenger safety. Last week, an Air India flight from Mumbai to New York was diverted to Delhi due to a bomb threat.","Government plans strict action against those spreading hoax messages.

NEW DELHI: Amid a bumper paddy crop, government has decided to scrap the export duty on parboiled rice and removed the Minimum Export Price (MEP) on overseas shipments of non-basmati white rice, moves that will force countries from Thailand and Vietnam to Pakistan to cut prices in the international market to deal with additional stocks.This also opens the doors for Indian tillers to tap the overseas market instead of depending on the Food Corporation of India to pick up their produce at the minimum support price at a time when godowns have three times the required buffer stock.India is the world's largest exporter of rice.""The notification to remove the earlier 10% export duty on parboiled rice will help exporters to be competitive in price-sensitive Africa. The scrapping of MEP on white rice will help us compete with Pakistani counterparts who are quoting below $460 when compared with India at $490 per tonne,"" said B V Krishna Rao , president of Rice Exporters Association. Earlier, the MEP for white rice was $490 per tonne.In July 2023, government had clamped down on exports to tame inflationary expectations amid signals of a weak monsoon. It had also turned down Karnataka's request to release extra stock from the central pool to help the Congress government fulfil its promise of 5 kg extra subsidised rice in addition to what the Centre was already providing.",Government has decided to scrap the export duty on parboiled rice and removed the Minimum Export Price (MEP) on overseas shipments of non-basmati white rice.

The breaking up of Intelsat-33e high throughput (HTS) geostationary communications satellite, operated by Intelsat and designed and manufactured by Boeing Space Systems , at the geostationary orbit at 35,000 km altitude, where satellites of several countries including India are closely parked, has raised alarm from Russia.Russian space agency Roscosmos, in a release, said, “The obtained data regarding the Intelsat-33e debris indicate that there is a potential threat to all operating spacecraft, including the geostationary orbital cluster of the Roscosmos state corporation.”Initial reports on Oct 19 said Intelsat-33e, weighing 6,600 kg, lost its power source, which led to a complete shutdown of the satellite. Later, US Space Forces-Space confirmed the satellite appeared to have broken up into at least 20 pieces.However, Roscosmos said Russia's near-Earth space hazardous situations warning system had detected about two dozen unidentified space objects near the spacecraft's position in orbit. “A significant increase in the number of space objects in the orbital plane of the lost Intelsat-33e telecommunication satellite has been identified. Roscosmos specialists have spotted more than 80 fragments,” Roscosmos stated.Preliminary analysis showed that the closest spacecraft to Intelsat-33e were the Express-AT1, Yamal-402, Express-AM6, and Electro-L satellites. As of last year, India has 29 operational satellites in the geostationary orbit (GEO), which provide crucial communication and surveillance services to the country.The amount of space debris in orbit around Earth is increasing rapidly. The European Space Agencyestimates there are more than 40,000 pieces larger than 10cm in orbit, and more than 130,000,000 smaller than 1cm.Intelsat-33e was launched in 2016 to provide communications across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The satellite experienced a propulsion issue shortly after launch and reached orbit later than expected. Another propulsion problem in 2017 decreased its estimated 15-year lifespan by 3.5 years.This is the second Boeing-made high-throughput “Epic” satellite to falter for the McLean, Virginia-based firm. In April 2019, Intelsat experienced the total loss of its Intelsat 29e spacecraft, which had powered connectivity for aeronautical, maritime, and wireless operators in Latin America, Caribbean and North Atlantic regions.","Intelsat-33e, weighing 6,600 kg, lost its power source, which led to a complete shutdown of the satellite.

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill and wife Keeta Vaccaro , have made headlines for the umpteenth time, but this one isn't about football. The power couple has placed their outrageous Florida mansion on the market for a whopping $9.6 million. Vaccaro confirmed through her Instagram story as all trade rumors regarding Hill continued to swirl.Also read - Injury Comebacks Dominate NFL’s 2024 Comeback Player Odds: Cousins, Dobbins, and Burrow Top the List On Tuesday,, the real estate group, posted the listing on Instagram-a sprawling property in Southwest Ranches owned by the Hills.But hours later,reshared the post on her Instagram story, confirming that the house had sold. Licensed Realtor Keeta is selling the house directly and teamed with Lifestyle International Realty to work out the details of the listing.Here is the seven-bedroom, eight-bathroom lavish house on an expansive 2.28-acre property lot. The amenities are as impressive as the home itself, including a resort-style swimming pool, an outdoor bonfire setup, a miniature golf course, and even a private cinema. Sports enthusiasts will appreciate the in-home basketball court, while the surrounding garden adds a peaceful touch to the lavish estate.When trade rumors of him leaving his current state are gaining momentum, Tyreek Hill has made a decision to sell his mansion in Florida. Earlier this month, the player had only fueled trade whispers when he added fuel to fire by sending out a cryptic tweet acknowledging such trade whispers. This got fans and analysts alike making conclusions whether selling the mansion was a signal for something more significant career-wise.Despite the mounting speculation, Hill signed a $90 million contract extension with the Dolphins earlier this year, keeping him with the team until 2026. Though his performance this season has not met the usual standards, it seems the Dolphins have no intention of trading him. NFL insider Dianna Russini confirmed on the “Scoop City” podcast that Miami is “not going to trade” Hill, shutting down the rumors.The buzz around Hill's potential departure escalated further after his cryptic response to Davante Adams’ trade request. Hill posted a tweet saying, ""woke up to trade news exciting,"" adding more fuel to the already raging fire. However, with no official word from the Dolphins, Hill’s future with the team remains intact—at least for now.With Tua Tagovailoa out due to a concussion sustained in Week 2, the Dolphins are sputtering on offense. As Week 8 draws near, one asks whether Hill can be one of the players who can elevate his game and his stats, or if these trade rumors are going to continue to pervade this season.Also read - ""Can Kansas City Defy the Odds and Go Undefeated in 2024?

Platform fee increase by Zomato

What may be the 'big difference' between the fee hike by Swiggy and Zomato

What exactly is Platform fees

Bengaluru-based food delivery platform Swiggy has hiked its platform fee to Rs 10 per order. The price increase For Swiggy's food delivery app come just a day after its Gurgaon-based rival increased the platform fee to Rs 10. While Zomato previously charged Rs 6 as platform fee, for Swiggy it stood at Rs 7 earlier.Zomato increased the platform fee it charges users for food delivery to Rs 10 per order during the festive season from Rs 7 earlier, according to information on the company’s app.“This fee helps us pay our bills to keep Zomato running. To maintain services during the festive rush, it has increased slightly,” a notification on the app said.Zomato has increased the platform fee temporarily. As the message on the Zomato app says that the fee has been increased ""To maintain services during festive rush,..."" However, there is no such clarification or notification on Swiggy app, so it is likely that the platform fee hike on Swiggy is permanent.Platform fees are additional charges applied to each food order, separate from restaurant charges, delivery fees and goods and services tax. To be sure, the platform fee also attracts GST of 18%, which is not included in the Rs 10 levy. This means Zomato’s customers will pay Rs 11.80 on every order as platform fee inclusive of tax.According to a report in Economic Times, as per people tracking the sector, these platforms deliver 2-2.5 million food-delivery orders per day and any increase in platform fee improves their revenue.Incidentally, Swiggy was the first to start charging platform fees. Zomato followed suit and introduced the platform fee in 2023, as a Rs 2 per order flat levy. This amount has been subsequently increased over time by both the companies.","Zomato increased the platform fee it charges users for food delivery to Rs 10 per order during the festive season from Rs 7 earlier.

All temporary or weakly fitted signboards or hoardings should also be removed before the storm hits the ground.The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has opened a 24 hours control room to manage preparedness, response and emergency situations. Officials will be on duty in shifts for the control room to function round the clock till October 26.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Canada to cut immigration for first time in years amid rising political pressure, housing woes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-to-cut-immigration-for-first-time-in-years-amid-rising-political-pressure-housing-woes/articleshow/114528046.cms,"Canada is set to significantly reduce its immigration numbers for the first time in years, marking a major shift in policy as the Justin Trudeau government faces increasing political pressure.Starting in 2025, the country will accept 395,000 new permanent residents, decreasing to 380,000 in 2026, and further to 365,000 in 2027. This is a sharp drop from the 485,000 expected in 2024, according to a report by Reuters.The reports of these new immigration targets come at a time of heightened diplomatic tensions between Canada and India.Relations between the two countries have soured following the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia and designated terrorist by India, which led to the expulsion of diplomats from both sides.India is the largest source of foreign-born residents in Canada, according to the most recent census.Canada's immigration policy has been under increasing scrutiny as the country faces a housing affordability crisis. The rising cost of homes, exacerbated by higher interest rates and a growing population, has sparked concerns about the sustainability of the current immigration system.Many Canadians feel priced out of the housing market, with polls showing that a growing number believe the country is accepting too many immigrants. This issue has become a central topic in Canadian politics ahead of the next federal election, expected no later than October 2025.Migrant advocates have criticized the government's decision, arguing it will leave many immigrants in precarious situations.This shift comes after a period when Canada loosened immigration rules during the Covid-19 pandemic to fill labor shortages. The government had initially planned to welcome 500,000 new permanent residents annually in 2025 and 2026.However, with over 2.8 million temporary residents in the country as of mid-2024, the government has started to tighten its immigration policies. Immigration minister Marc Miller has said that Canadians want a system that is better regulated and not ""out of control.""The government has also pledged to reduce the share of temporary residents in the population and introduced caps on international students and foreign workers. These changes are intended to address concerns about wage suppression and the exploitation of temporary workers in Canada's labor market.","Starting in 2025, the country will accept 395,000 new permanent residents.

E Coli Outbreak: Deadly E coli outbreak linked to McDonald's burger hits 10 US states: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deadly-e-coli-outbreak-linked-to-mcdonalds-burger-hits-10-us-states-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/114483137.cms,"Representtative image (Picture credit: Reuters)

Here's what you need to know:

Infections were reported in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.

One death was reported in Colorado; 10 hospitalizations, including a child with severe kidney complications.

All interviewed individuals reported consuming food from McDonald’s, primarily Quarter Pounders.

Investigators are examining slivered onions and beef patties as potential sources of contamination.

Preliminary findings suggest slivered onions from a single supplier may be linked to some illnesses.

McDonald’s has removed Quarter Pounder hamburgers and slivered onions from menus in affected states and parts of Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

The company has temporarily halted the distribution of slivered onions sourced from the implicated supplier and emphasized its commitment to food safety.

The implicated strain, E coli O157:H7, causes approximately 74,000 infections annually in the US, leading to severe symptoms including fever, stomach cramps, and bloody diarrhoea.

Young children are particularly vulnerable and can experience severe complications like acute kidney failure.

McDonald's has faced a decline in global same-store sales for the first time in nearly four years, prompting the introduction of a $5 meal deal that does not include the Quarter Pounder.

Following the CDC’s announcement, company shares dropped 9 per cent in after-hours trading.

An E coli outbreak associated with McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers has emerged as a significant public health concern, impacting at least 49 individuals across ten states. Federal health officials have confirmed that the outbreak has resulted in one death and ten hospitalizations, including a child facing severe kidney complications.The centers for disease control and prevention ( CDC ) is actively investigating the situation, which has sparked concerns regarding food safety and the fast-food giant’s menu offerings.The infections have been traced back to a period between September 27 and October 11, with the majority of cases reported in Colorado , which has logged the highest number of infections.As officials work to identify the source of the contamination, initial findings suggest that slivered onions and hamburger patties may be to blame. McDonald’s has responded to the outbreak by removing the implicated items from menus in affected states and halting distribution of certain ingredients.This outbreak comes at a challenging time for McDonald's , which has recently experienced declines in global same-store sales. As the fast-food chain grapples with the impact of inflation on consumer behavior, this health crisis may further strain its reputation and financial performance. The investigation is ongoing, with health officials urging the public to be vigilant about the symptoms of E coli infection.","At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.
