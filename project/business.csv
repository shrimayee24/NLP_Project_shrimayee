India releases first national lung cancer care guidelines ahead of World Cancer Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-releases-first-national-lung-cancer-care-guidelines-ahead-of-world-cancer-day/articleshow/127900266.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major step towards standardising cancer care, the Centre on Tuesday released India’s first nationally developed, evidence-based guidelines for lung cancer treatment and palliation, aimed at improving early diagnosis, reducing treatment gaps and ensuring patient-centric care across the country.Union health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda released the Lung Cancer Treatment and Palliation: Evidence-Based Guidelines at Kartavya Bhavan on the eve of World Cancer Day. The document outlines 15 evidence-based recommendations covering diagnosis, treatment pathways and palliative care, applicable to both public and private healthcare systems.Officials said the guidelines address wide variations in lung cancer care in India, where late diagnosis remains a major challenge and treatment practices differ sharply across regions. By providing a common clinical framework, the guidelines aim to strengthen decision-making, improve outcomes and ensure consistent standards of care.Nadda said India must develop its own context-specific healthcare solutions rather than rely solely on Western clinical models. He stressed that early detection is one of the biggest hurdles in lung cancer management and called for stronger prevention and screening strategies, particularly among high-risk populations.Developed by experts under the Department of Health Research and the Directorate General of Health Services, the guidelines use internationally accepted scientific methods but are tailored to India’s disease burden and healthcare realities. They place equal emphasis on treatment and palliation, focusing on both survival and quality of life.The guidelines are expected to help standardise care across states, improve access to palliative services and reduce disparities between public and private hospitals. A plain-language summary will also be issued to help patients and caregivers better understand treatment options.Senior health officials and experts involved in drafting the guidelines were present at the release.","The document outlines 15 evidence-based recommendations covering diagnosis, treatment pathways and palliative care.

14 Naxals Neutralized In Sukma And Bijapur As Security Forces Launch Anti-Maoist Operation

NEW DELHI: The year gone by witnessed the neutralisation of 364 Naxals by the security forces, even as 1,022 Maoists were arrested and 2,337 opted for surrender, the home ministry informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.Replying to separate questions on the status of Left-wing extremism (LWE) in the country, junior home minister Nityanand Rai shared that the total districts that reported incidents of Maoist violence fell to 32 in 2025 from 61 in 2019, while the total number of police stations witnessing such incidents declined to 119 from 245 over the same period.He said LWE incidents showed 88% dip from a high of 1,936 in 2010 to 234 in 2025, while civilians and security personnel's deaths in LWE incidents nosedived to 100 in 2025, which is one-tenth of those recorded in 2010.As per records accessed by TOI, the past one year saw the neutralisation of a dozen Maoists, including their No. 1 Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju. Apart from Basavaraju, who was a politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) member, 11 other CC members were killed in 2025 and early 2026. Another five CC members, including Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu who was also in PB, surrendered and joined the mainstream last year.As of now, only 1 PB/CC member and three CC members are alive/active -- Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji, the current No. 1; Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathi; Misir Besra; and Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram. Sources told TOI that Ganpathi and Sangram, both in their late Seventies, have not been active in the recent past.Since 2019, thanks to the upgraded incentives for surrenders by Maoists, as many as 5,880 Maoists, of which 40% (2,337) were in 2025 alone, have eschewed the path of violence and laid down arms. Another 7,409 Maoists have been arrested since 2019. In fact, between Jan 1 and 15 this year, 18 Naxals were arrested and 139 had surrendered.Currently, only 8 districts across three states are categorised as LWE-hit, down from 126 in 2018.The Centre, which has declared a March 31, 2026 deadline to uproot Naxalism from the country, informed the LS that it has released Rs 3,682 crore to LWE-hit states for operational expenditure and training needs of counter-Naxal security personnel, rehabilitation of surrendered LWE cadres and ex-gratia to families of forces and civilians killed in LWE violence. Another Rs 1,761 was sanctioned to LWE states for strengthening their special forces, intelligence units and police stations. Central agencies have been provided Rs 1,224 crore since 2014-15 for setting up security camps in Maoist-infested areas and provisioning helicopters for counter-LWE operations, said Rai.","The year gone by witnessed the neutralisation of 364 Naxals by the security forces. 1,022 Maoists were arrested and 2,337 opted for surrender.

NEW DELHI: Indicating a positive outcome of its vibrant villages programme (VVP), which in is first phase unveiled development projects in villages abutting the Indo-China border across five states, the home ministry told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that at least three villages in Arunachal Pradesh have reported reverse migration by their people.""No impact assessment has been carried out (of VVP). However, the state govt of Arunachal Pradesh has informed of people returning to villages in border districts of Kurung Kumey, Dibang Valley and Shi-Yomi,"" junior home minister Nityanand Rai shared with the House.The objective of VVP is to create better living conditions and adequate livelihood opportunities to ensure prosperous and safe borders, control trans-border crime and assimilate the border population with the nation and inculcate them ‘as eyes and ears of the border guarding forces’, crucial for internal security. The development and connectivity boost is essentially aimed at preventing outmigration by the residents of border villages.Rai said that projects or works with an outlay of Rs 3,431 crore were sanctioned by MHA under VVP-I, of which villages of Arunachal Pradesh received the lion's share of Rs 2750 crore for a total 2,082 projects. More than 8,500 activities like awareness drives, service delivery camps, training and capacity building initiatives, health and veterinary camps, fairs and festivals and tourism promotion activities, etc, were undertaken, of which 2,966 were in Arunachal Pradesh, 2,221 in Ladakh, 1,836 in Uttarakhand, 1,016 in Himachal Pradesh and 530 in Sikkim.NEW DELHIRai further shared that VVP-II too was approved on Apr 2, 2025 for the comprehensive development of 1,954 identified villages abutting international borders of 15 states and 2 Union territories. An outlay of Rs 6,839 crore has been okayed till 2028-29 for VVP-II, covering villages in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, J&K, Ladakh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.",Three villages in Arunachal Pradesh have reported reverse migration by their people.

NDA MPs Felicitate PM Modi For India-US trade Deal At Parliamentary Party Meeting

NDA known for carving lines in stone, says Modi

NEW DELHI: With a couple of big-ticket trade deals in his bag within a matter of days, PM Modi asserted on Tuesday that the world is recognising India’s strength and according it renewed respect, even as he cautioned governing alliance MPs against any sense of complacency over the govt’s achievements.Addressing the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party meeting where he was felicitated for India’s trade agreements, including with EU and US, Modi said India is at the centre of an uncertain world as past alliances give way to new alignments, emphasising that the new year has been particularly encouraging for India, sources said.In this context, Modi praised the Budget for its farsightedness and strengthening India’s prospects to become developed by 2047, with FM Nirmala Sitharaman briefing MPs on its highlights. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said MPs exuded happiness over the conclusion of nine trade deals covering 39 countries and credited Modi’s leadership.Modi’s early morning post on X quoting a Sanskrit shloka to emphasise the power of self-confidence was seen as a reference to last-night’s announcement of an Indo-US trade agreement by US President Donald Trump and him.“Self-confidence is the strength that makes everything possible. This power is going to be of great help in realising people’s dreams of a Viksit Bharat,” the PM said.An MP said Modi personified confidence at the meeting, which observers pinned on the success of trade negotiations with the US, and recalled the numerous steps India took following the Covid outbreak in 2019 that have since begun bearing fruit. With India being seen as a reliable partner by many leading countries, he said his govt had stuck to its strategy and kept patience.Besides painting a bright future for the economy at the meeting, Modi expressed confidence over NDA’s political prospects, noting its triumph in a series of polls, including in assemblies and local bodies in different parts of the country.At the same time, sources said, he reminded NDA MPs that while it is easy to carve a line in butter, NDA is known for carving a line in stone. The winning streak must be maintained, Modi said, urging the parliamentarians to continue their work for the masses.He spoke of NDA’s expansion in Tamil Nadu and BJP’s win in Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation poll in Kerala to stress the alliance’s increasing acceptability.Modi said some students clear one exam in junior grade and then believe they will face similarly easy tests in senior classes, only to end up failing, remarks which some MPs interpreted as a dig at Rahul Gandhi even though he did not name anyone.Emphasising the need for MPs to remain dutiful, he praised the contribution of Rajya Sabha member C Sadanandan Master, who wears prosthetic legs after losing his limbs in a brutal attack, allegedly by Left members, to BJP.","PM Modi was felicitated for India’s trade agreements, including with EU and US.

"Govt collects health cess, but spends less than it did earlier",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-collects-health-cess-but-spends-less-than-it-did-earlier/articleshow/127894852.cms,"Representative image

0.5 percentage point fall in 10 years

Despite collecting a cess specifically for health, the Centre’s spending on health is now lower than it was before the cess was imposed, both as a share of the total budget and as a proportion of the GDP.Before the health cess was introduced in 2018, the allocation for health was 2.4% of total govt expenditure in 2017-18. In the Budget Estimates for 2026-27, that is down to 1.9%. As a proportion of the GDP, the decline is from 0.28% to 0.26%. Money collected as health cess amounts to over 30% of the allocation for health and family welfare in 2026-27. Without the cess component, health would have accounted for just 1.3% of the total Budget, barely over half of the figure in 2017-18.When the health cess was introduced, the understanding was that it would boost health expenditure by topping up what the govt was already allocating. Clearly, that has not happened. Instead, cess is masking what would otherwise be a steep cut in the share of health in total Budget and in GDP.From 0.32% of the GDP in 2019, the year before Covid struck, the share has fallen to 0.27% even with the cess component. Remove the cess component and the share of health in the GDP is 0.18%.The target of the National Health Policy was 2.5% of the GDP by 2025 of which 35% was supposed to be the share of central govt, which works out to 0.9% of the GDP or Rs 3.5 lakh, over three times the current allocation.If we were to strip the cess money off the revised Budget allocation for 2025-26 which was Rs 92,926 crore, it would be Rs 78,279 crore. Do the same for the 2026-27 allocation and it falls to Rs 70,984 crore, which is 9.3% lower than the 2025-26 revised allocation without cess.We could look at it differently. If govt were to allocate the same share (2.4%) of the total Budget as it did in 2017, the allocation this year would have been Rs 1.2 lakh crore without the cess. Instead, even with cess the allocation has been just Rs 1 lakh crore.“The health and education cess flatters the health allocation without increasing allocation from the consolidated fund. Cess money flows from a reserve fund outside the regular Budget process, with no outcome monitoring requirements. Moreover, cess requires no parliamentary accountability. You create the impression of increased Budget allocation but in reality, states have no claim on cess. It is entirely the discretion of the central govt,” said economist Dr Varna Sri Raman.In 2018, then finance minister Arun Jaitley introduced the health cess, saying the 3% education cess was being increased to 4% health and education cess “in order to take care of the needs of education and health of BPL and rural families”.“Though it is assumed the additional 1% is for health, the Finance Act doesn’t prescribe how the 4% is to be divided between health and education. Central govt decides each year how much goes into Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Nidhi (PMSSN) which is a fund created to hold the health component of the cess,” said Sri Raman. PMSSN was only created in 2021, two years after the cess was introduced.“The health cess collected from 2018-19 and 2019-20 went into the general revenues. That’s roughly Rs 20,600 crore collected in the name of health that went into general revenues with no earmarking,” she added.","Before the health cess was introduced in 2018, the allocation for health was 2.4% of total govt expenditure in 2017-18. In the Budget Estimates for 2026-27, that is down to 1.9%.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

What happened at Heathrow?

UK incident challenges claim AI fuel switch movement was manual: Expert

MUMBAI: In a development with direct implications for the investigation into the June 12 fatal Air India Boeing 787 Ahmedabad crash, another Air India Dreamliner saw a fuel control switch move from “run” to “cut-off” after a crew member pressed it to check whether it was locked.The switch moved without the required lift action, suggesting the safeguard meant to prevent fuel supply cut off and inadvertent engine shutdown did not function as designed, sources said. The London incident challenges the controversial narrative that the Ahmedabad crash resulted from a deliberate pilot act, pointing instead to a possible and critical technical flaw in the aircraft’s fuel switch design.The incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT-ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru. The fuel control switches on the 787 require a two-step action: they must be lifted before they can be moved between “run” and “cut-off”. The safety feature is intended to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown.“The pilot lightly pushed the left fuel control switch to check if its lock feature was working and found it was not because the switch moved though it was not lifted first,” the source said. It again failed to lock the second time.But the third time the switch stayed locked and did not move without lifting. The aircraft departed at 9.40pm for Bengaluru, where it is currently grounded.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report released last July, said that both fuel control switches on the ill-fated aircraft had moved from “run” to “cut off” seconds after takeoff. The report said one pilot asked the other why did he cut off the fuel, to which the other responded that he did not do so.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report, added that no technical or design flaw was found with the aircraft so far, implying pilot action. Therafter, the DGCA mandated an inspection of the fuel switch locking system. Air India later announced that it completed these inspections and found no faults. But the London incident brings back to fore the unresolved question around switch design, its locking integrity and the possibility of inadvertent activation, said sources.A senior commander said: “The London incident directly challenges the assumption that fuel switch movement in the Air India crash was manual. Until now, the cut-off transition was treated as near-conclusive evidence of pilot action. The London event shows that uncommanded switch behaviour, through mechanical detent failure, signal corruption or other causes, is a credible failure mode. That places the DGCA’s earlier claim of fleet clearance under sharp scrutiny, as a defect appearing months later suggests inspections may have been visual, non-diagnostic, or incomplete. For the AAIB, the implication is clear: fuel cutoff can no longer be equated with intent, the investigation must widen to fleet-level and component analysis, and attribution of deliberate pilot action without fully eliminating system anomalies is no longer defensible.”Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh said: “The London incident is particularly concerning because in 2018 the US aviation regulator cautioned that fuel control switches on Boeing 787s could malfunction and lead to inadvertent engine shutdown. Occurring after Air India said its fleet’s fuel control switches have been checked, and amid the ongoing June 12 B787 crash investigation, it raises serious questions about inspection adequacy and demands the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. ”Air India, in a statement, said: “We are aware that one of our pilots has reported a possible defect on the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft. After receiving this initial information, we have grounded the said aircraft and are involving the OEM to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis. The matter has been communicated to the aviation regulator, DGCA. Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA, and had found no issues. ” Boeing said: “We are in contact with Air India and are supporting their review of this matter”.",Incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT- ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: A study comparing homeopathic treatment with conventional primary care for infants has been retracted by European Journal of Pediatrics, citing serious flaws in the study design.In a retraction note, the journal’s editor said concerns were raised after publication about the methodology of the randomised controlled trial, particularly the absence of blinding and placebo controls. A post-publication review found that these shortcomings could introduce “significant bias” in the interpretation of the data and conclusions.The editor said the flaws were fundamental and could not be corrected through an erratum, adding that there was no longer confidence in the reliability of the article.The study, published in 2024, examined homeopathic treatment versus standard primary care for kids during the first 24 months of life, a period requiring high ethical and scientific safeguards.According to the journal, the authors have been invited to submit a revised manuscript addressing the concerns. However, the retraction note states that the authors do not agree with the decision, a position conveyed by lead author Menachem Oberbaum.The paper involved authors from multiple institutions, including India, and had drawn attention because it compared an alternative system of medicine with conventional care in a vulnerable age group.Although the article remains available as an open-access publication, it is now clearly labelled as retracted.",Study comparing homeopathic treatment with conventional primary care for infants has been retracted.

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

NEW DELHI: The India-US trade deal allows both sides to get the relationship back on to an even keel, but whether it can lead to long-term stability in ties remains open to question.The importance of the agreement, even if conditional, cannot be overstated as it allows India and the US to avert an immediate crisis. India just managed to rid itself of an albatross around its neck that was threatening to smother cooperation with its most important strategic partner even in other areas. However, the estrangement with the US since Donald Trump’s return to the White House has not been about trade alone. There are several other friction points.The first is the India-Pakistan re-hyphenation Trump has brought upon India through his courting of Rawalpindi. It is here US ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who seems to have found a way out of the trade impasse within weeks of arrival, may have an important role to play. Suspense still looms over his dual role as Trump’s special envoy for south Asia and any false move bracketing India with Pakistan, let alone playing sheriff, will be met with resistance.Bilateralism has been the leitmotif of India’s Pakistan policy and, as far as India is concerned, there’s no Nobel Peace Prize for any third party to win.The second concern is related to the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific under Trump, who wants to engage his counterpart Xi Jinping for a “stable peace, fair trade and respectful relations”. Trade differences between India and the US were seen as blocking any forward movement by Quad and a US-India reset must surely clear the ground for a summit meeting. While the US 2026 National Defence Strategy underlines the goal of a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific , it makes no mention of Quad or India.Thirdly, India’s strategic autonomy will likely continue to act as a limiting factor. India will continue to use the same to navigate geopolitical complexities, especially in its relations with the US, Russia and China. India may have, according to Trump, promised to stop buying Russian oil but it will continue to work closely with Moscow in defence and in forums like the SCO and BRICS. India would like Russia to see its energy pivot as a blip caused by market conditions, not as an ebbing of its strategic autonomy.For India, the structural shift in how the US handles the H-1B visa programme remains a major irritant that it hopes Washington will address.Finally, India will also be concerned about the transactional relationship that the US under Trump seeks with India. Many claims made by Trump in his announcement India saying no to Russian oil, agreeing to buy energy and other products worth $500 billion from the US, zero tariff on US products have not yet been confirmed by Indian govt, suggesting there might be a devil in the details. India will hope that some of Trump’s claims are just political signalling, not an ultimatum.",The India-US trade deal allows both sides to get the relationship back on to an even keel. But whether it can lead to long-term stability in ties remains open to question.

BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court has imposed Rs 50,000 in costs on Wipro Enterprises Private Limited, terming its stand in an ex gratia payment dispute an abuse of the process of law. The cost is payable to a former staff who was the plaintiff before the civil court.The dispute concerned the non-payment of an ex gratia amount promised to Ratnesh Pandey, a resident of Haryana, who resigned from the company in Sept 2017 after working for nearly 12 years in various posts. Pandey tendered his resignation on Aug 6, 2017, and it was accepted on Sept 18, 2017.In recognition of his contribution, he was offered an ex gratia lump sum amount of Rs 6,32,000, payable after 18 months from the date of cessation of employment, subject to the condition that from the date of cessation he would not join competing companies, namely Philips India Limited or Bajaj Electricals Ltd. As the ex gratia amount was not paid even after 18 months and repeated correspondence, Pandey approached the civil court seeking payment of the amount along with 18% interest.Wipro disputed the claim, contending that Pandey had not accepted the terms and conditions of the cessation letter and therefore was not entitled to payment of the ex gratia amount. On July 23, 2024, the 20th additional city civil judge, Bengaluru, ruled in favour of Pandey.Wipro appealed, arguing the cessation letter dated Sept 18, 2017, for want of acceptance from Pandey, stood revoked under Section 6(2) of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and that belated acceptance after 18 months was unacceptable. Pandey said Wipro never alleged breach of contract conditions before the civil court.In his ruling, Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted that Aug 19, 2017, was Pandey’s last working day and rejected Wipro’s claim that signing and returning the letter was a mandatory condition, holding that the phrase “return to us for records” could not be treated as a condition precedent. HC held Wipro had acted upon the cessation letter and, having failed to prove any breach by Pandey, could not deny payment on hyper-technical grounds.","The Karnataka high court has imposed Rs 50,000 in costs on Wipro Enterprises Private Limited.

The summons direct the three to respond to charges under IPC sections 465 (forgery), 471 (using forged document or electronic record), and 499 and 500 (criminal defamation).The complaint stems from allegations by Nayak in June 2024 that Sharma used “derogatory language” against her during a live TV debate. Sharma said the accusations were based on a tampered video containing captions not part of the original broadcast. Sharma said the video was circulated on X by Nayak and amplified by Khera and Ramesh, causing “reputational harm”.","A Delhi court on Tuesday summoned Congress’s Jairam Ramesh, Pawan Khera and Ragini Nayak in a criminal defamation case.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to decide afresh whether it is necessary for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to probe a 2018 complaint accusing e-commerce major Flipkart of abuse of its market dominant position.Taking up an appeal by Flipkart against a March 4, 2020, NCLAT order, a three-judge bench headed by CJI Surya Kant said it would be proper if the tribunal decided afresh whether a probe was necessary to be conducted in a 2018 complaint, which accused the e-commerce platform of resorting to predatory pricing.Fair-trade regulator CCI had rejected the complaint by All India Online Vendors Association. However, on appeal, NCLAT had asked CCI to conduct a probe on the complaint.

Litigant has right to know judgment on their plea: CJI

NEW DELHI: A Jharkhand HC judge kept his verdict reserved in a writ petition for two years and orally pronounced it on Dec 4 after SC found the delay “shocking”, but even after two months, there is no sign of a written judgment, which has been neither uploaded to HC website nor made available to parties.When senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi brought this to the notice of the court and said such incidents discredit the judicial system, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi admitted this is a problem with some HC judges, which needs urgent rectification. The CJI said, “It is an identified ailment of the justice delivery system. It must be cured and not allowed to infect the system.”A litigant who approaches the court must get to know what judgment is given on his plea,” the CJI said. The same HC judge, Justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay, was found to have kept several judgments pending for years, even in cases where the convicts had appealed against their capital and life sentences. The judge had delivered the verdicts in those cases only after SC took judicial notice of the same.Amicus curiae Fauzia Shakeel said Rohatgi’s client can afford to approach SC for the inordinate delay in pronouncement of verdict and complain about subsequent non-availability of the written judgment.“But how many from the states and rural areas can afford to bear the cost of coming to Delhi and engaging a lawyer to apprise the court of such delays by HCs?” she asked. The CJI candidly said certain HC judges have devised innovations to step around the timeline fixed for pronouncement of judgments by reserving their verdicts and listing such cases again, purportedly to seek certain clarifications.When Rohatgi said that SC must administratively ask the chief justices of HCs to monitor whether reserved verdicts are pronounced within three months, CJI said a conference of HC chief justices is being organised on Feb 7 where he would raise this issue along with those pertaining to other reforms in judiciary he has proposed.The bench asked the Jharkhand HC judge to make available the written judgment within two weeks by uploading it to the HC website and directed the Registry to provide its certified copies to the parties. The CJI said, “Judges should not reserve decisions in a large number of cases when it is beyond them to pen judgments expeditiously. They must use the vacations to complete their pending work.”","A Jharkhand HC judge kept his verdict reserved in a writ petition for two years and orally pronounced it on Dec 4 after SC found the delay ‘shocking’ The CJI said, “It is an identified ailment of the justice delivery system.

Yumnam Khemchand Singh: Two-term MLA

Violence in Manipur has declinedbut situation is still far from ideal

NEW DELHI: Yumnam Khemchand Singh, a former Manipur assembly speaker, second-term MLA and a taekwondo master, is set to be the new CM of the state after BJP MLAs elected him as their leader on Tuesday, paving the way for the installation of a popular govt to replace President’s Rule imposed on Feb 13 last year.Keen to project a message of ethnic reconciliation in the north-eastern state, which was rocked by Meitei versus Kuki violence, BJP is considering appointing two deputy CMs — one each from the Kuki and Naga communities, with Singh being a Meitei. Nemcha Kipgen, a Kuki figure and former minister, is likely to be one of the deputy CMs. Singh (62), a second-term MLA from Singjamei in Imphal, is seen as the most acceptable choice in the state.Though the violence in Manipur has declined, the situation is far from ideal as both the communities are largely confined to regions of their dominance in the state.Singh was elected as the leader at a meeting of 35 of 37 BJP MLAs — two were absent due to illness — at the party headquarters in presence of central observer Tarun Chugh and the party’s in-charge for northeast region Sambit Patra.His visit to relief camps housing Kukis on Dec 8 made him the only Meitei MLA to do so. While he was the speaker between 2017 to 2022, Singh — who was last year awarded a fifth-dan black — served as a minister in the second Biren Singh govt, holding several key portfolios.While a big majority of BJP MLAs is from the Meitei community, the party also has Kuki and Naga MLAs, and enjoys support of several MLAs from different communities and parties. BJP allies were also called to Delhi.","Yumnam Khemchand Singh, a former Manipur assembly speaker, second-term MLA and a taekwondo master, is set to be the new CM of the state.

NEW DELHI: You can loosen your purse strings a little more abroad. Travellers flying into India will now have enhanced duty-free limit, which for resident Indians has been hiked from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. What’s more, duty-free import of one laptop for passengers above 18 years has now been allowed under Baggage Rules, 2026, which came into effect from Feb 2. No general duty-free allowance is available for passengers entering India through land borders, regardless of nationality.Jewellery allowance has also been simplified. “Special allowances for jewellery have been prescribed solely on weight basis by removing outdated value caps, under which eligible returning residents/tourists of Indian origin (after stay abroad for more than one year), are allowed duty-free jewellery purely on a weight basis,” a govt statement said. Men are allowed to import jewellery up to 20 gram duty-free while female passengers can import up to 40 gram.The transfer of residence benefits has also been simplified and modernised by having only a single rationalised list of duty-free articles, with an overall value cap as per eligibility.Duty-free allowance for resident Indians, tourists of Indian origin and foreigners with an Indian visa (other th-an tourist) is now Rs 75,000.For tourists of foreign orig-in, it’s Rs 25,000.

New goods like gifts purchases abroad qualify according to new limits. Goods above the duty-free limit are dutiable under normal customs provisions unless specifically exempted by the law. These allowances apply only to goods carried on the passenger’s person or in bona fide baggage.Some items are not part of duty-free allowances and have separate conditions or limits. These include alcohol and spirits beyond specified volumes, tobacco products beyond allowance threshold, gold or silver in forms other than jewellery, and large electronic goods like televisions.","Duty-free allowance for resident Indians, tourists of Indian origin and foreigners with an Indian visa (other th-an tourist) is now Rs 75,000.

DGCA Rules Out Fault in AI’s Boeing 787

MUMBAI: Checks carried out on the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner grounded in Bengaluru found its fuel control switch lock to be satisfactory, said the ministry of civil aviation on Tuesday, even as another AI Dreamliner was grounded over technical reasons, this time in Dubai.The latest grounding involved B787 (VT-ANN) scheduled to operate an 8.40pm departure from Dubai to Delhi, flight AIC 916, on Feb 2. The aircraft took off on Feb 3 at 5.30pm. It was grounded due to what has been described as a “technical reason”. It is not yet known whether the issue involves a fuel switch lock-related problem. Air India did not comment.The first grounding occurred on Feb 1 after a malfunction was registered by the crew of B787 (VT-ANX) during engine start to operate flight AI-132 from London to Bengaluru. The incident was critical as the fuel control switch locking mechanism has been at the centre of the investigation into the June 12 Air India Ahmedabad crash.Referring to the London incident, the ministry said the crew observed on two occasions that the left engine fuel control switch did not remain positively latched in the “RUN” position when light vertical pressure was applied. On a subsequent attempt, the switch latched correctly and remained stable and the crew went on to operate the flight in Bengaluru.In Bengaluru, during the check, “both left and right switches were checked and found satisfactory, with the locking tooth fully seated and not slipping from RUN to CUTOFF,” the ministry said. “When full force was applied parallel to the base plate, the switch remained secure. However, applying external force in an incorrect direction caused the switch to move easily from RUN to CUTOFF, due to the angular base plate allowing slip when pressed improperly with finger or thumb,” it added. AI as been advised to circulate Boeing’s recommended procedures for the operation of the fuel cut-off switch to its flight crew, it said.Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh pointed out that even if force is applied in the incorrect direction, the switch should not move unless it is lifted.The ministry statement also said based on Boeing’s communication, the pull-to-unlock force was checked on the fuel control switch using the recommended procedure on the involved fuel cut off switch, the fuel control unit to be installed and fuel cut off switch of another aircraft. In all cases the pull-to-unlock force was found within limits.","The latest grounding involved B787 (VT-ANN) scheduled to operate an 8.40pm departure from Dubai to Delhi, flight AIC 916, on Feb 2.

Sustained PM2.5 exposure ups depression risk: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sustained-pm2-5-exposure-ups-depression-risk-study/articleshow/127897069.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: As the Union Budget steps up focus on strengthening mental health infrastructure, a nationwide study has flagged a rise in depression and anxiety linked to long-term exposure to toxic fine particles in the air, underlining how environmental risks are adding to India’s mental health burden.The study was led by researchers from IIT-Delhi, in collaboration with AIIMS New Delhi, NIMHANS and St John’s Medical College, and published in international journal iScience.Analysing data from 34,802 adults across 12 states, including Punjab, UP, Rajasthan and Assam, researchers found sustained exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an 8% higher odds of depression and a 2% increase in anxiety.The analysis is based on clinically diagnosed cases from National Mental Health Survey (2015–16) and is cross-sectional, meaning it establishes association rather than causation. One of the authors, Dr Anand Krishna from the community medicine department at AIIMS, said this distinction was important. However, he noted even modest associations assumed significance because a very large segment of the population was exposed to polluted air.The burden was highest among urban metro residents, people aged 40-49 years, and those from lower-income groups. Regionally, pollution-linked depression showed stronger associations in eastern India, while anxiety was more prominent in the western region.Risks also peaked during the post-monsoon season, when pollution levels typically rise.The study went beyond overall PM2.5 levels to examine individual chemical constituents of air pollution. It found components largely generated by traffic, industry and agricultural activity — including sulphates, nitrates and ammonium — had stronger links with depression. Elemental carbon, a marker of diesel and fossil-fuel combustion, was most strongly associated with anxiety.By identifying pollution components, the researchers said the study helped prioritise emission sources for targeted action, with clear policy relevance at a time when air quality has worsened across many regions.The analysis also covered participants from Gujarat, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, using advanced satellite data and atmospheric modelling.","A nationwide study has flagged a rise in depression and anxiety linked to long- term exposure to toxic fine particles in the air.

Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta on Tuesday took charge of Old Delhi Redevelopment and said that her government will accord top priority to its redevelopment while focusing on conserving its heritage.She stated that Shahjahanabad was not merely a locality but a symbol of Delhi's rich historical and cultural identity.The chief minister has been appointed chairperson of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), an official said.Gupta said that the Delhi government aims to develop Old Delhi as a major tourism hub.The chief minister said that overhead electricity cables in the narrow lanes of the Walled City will be shifted underground to enhance safety and improve the area's aesthetics. To address traffic congestion in market areas, a comprehensive traffic management plan will be prepared, along with the development of multi-level parking facilities.She noted that Old Delhi is a historic residential area where every lane reflects heritage and history. Alongside development, special attention will be given to the conservation of havelis, katras, and kunchas.Previously proposed SRDC projects--including the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk, development of the Jama Masjid area, beautification of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg, and the road stretch from Delhi Gate to Kashmiri Gate--will be reviewed afresh.The chief minister also said that Old Delhi has long suffered from inadequate basic infrastructure. The government will ensure uninterrupted road construction, lane improvements, repair of the dilapidated sewer system, and a clear blueprint for a continuous drinking water supply. Cleanliness and sanitation in the area will also remain key priorities.The Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation was constituted by the Delhi government on May 1, 2008, as a special purpose vehicle to coordinate development works among various agencies, including the Municipal Corporation, PWD and the Tourism Department.

Uttarakhand has opened 83 mountain peaks in the Garhwal and Kumaon Himalayan regions for mountaineering expeditions, expanding access to several high-altitude summits that were earlier restricted. The move has been implemented by the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Council in coordination with the Forest Department.The peaks range between 5,700 metres and 7,756 metres in height and include well-known mountains such as Kamet, Nanda Devi East, Chaukhamba, Trishul, Shivling, Satopanth, Changabang, Panchachuli and Neelkanth. These mountains are considered technically challenging and attract experienced climbers from India and abroad.Under the new policy, Indian mountaineers will not be required to pay expedition-related charges such as peak fees, camping fees or environmental charges for these 83 peaks. Earlier, such fees were collected by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Forest Department.For foreign mountaineers, additional state-level charges have been removed. They will now pay only the fees prescribed by the Indian Mountaineering Foundation.All applications for mountaineering expeditions will now be submitted through the Uttarakhand Mountaineering Permission System, an online portal designed to handle approvals digitally.The decision is also expected to increase tourism activity in remote and border villages. Local residents may find work as guides, porters, homestay operators and transport providers linked to expeditions.Officials said all expeditions will be required to follow safety guidelines and environmental norms. Mountaineers must adhere to waste management rules and the “Leave no trace” principle to protect the fragile Himalayan ecosystem.Separately, the Union Budget 2026–27 has announced plans to develop eco-friendly mountain trails in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, as part of a broader push to promote trekking and adventure tourism in hill states.","The 83 peaks range between 5,700 metres and 7,756 metres in height.

NEW DELHI: A study comparing homoeopathy with conventional primary care in infants has been retracted by the European Journal of Pediatrics, citing serious flaws in the study design.In a retraction note, the journal’s editor said concerns were raised after publication about the methodology of the randomised controlled trial, particularly the absence of blinding and placebo controls. A post-publication review found that these shortcomings could introduce “significant bias” in the interpretation of the data and conclusions.The editor said the flaws were fundamental and could not be corrected through an erratum, adding that there was no longer confidence in the reliability of the article.The study, published in 2024, examined homoeopathic treatment versus standard primary care in children during the first 24 months of life, a period requiring high ethical and scientific safeguards.According to the journal, the authors have been invited to submit a revised manuscript addressing the concerns. However, the retraction note states that the authors do not agree with the decision, a position conveyed by lead author Menachem Oberbaum.The paper involved authors from multiple institutions, including India, and had drawn attention because it compared an alternative system of medicine with conventional care in a vulnerable age group.Although the article remains available as an open-access publication, it is now clearly labelled as retracted.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

NEW DELHI: Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Tuesday said both switches of an Air India Boeing 787-8 aircraft were found to be “satisfactory” after the pilots reported a possible defect in the fuel control switch upon landing in Bengaluru from London.The incident occurred earlier this week. In response, Air India grounded the aircraft and initiated a fleet-wide inspection of fuel control switches on its Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fleet.“Both left and right switches were checked and found satisfactory, with the locking tooth/pawl fully seated and not slipping from RUN to CUTOFF. When full force was applied parallel to the base plate, the switch remained secure. However, applying external force in an indirect direction caused the switch to move easily from RUN to CUTOFF, due to the angular base plate allowing slip when pressed improperly with a finger or thumb,” the DGCA said in a statement, according to ANI.The aviation regulator further stated, citing its communication with the manufacturer Boeing, that the US-based aircraft maker had checked the pull-to-unlock force using the recommended procedure, and in all cases, it was found to be within limits.The DGCA noted that these checks were conducted in the presence of its officers.Meanwhile, according to sources, an issue was identified with a “specific component” of the jet, with the component set to be replaced.“Air India will send the impacted Fuel Control Switch module to the OEM for further checks. The total life of the component in question is 20,000 hours, but the total hours used so far are only 3,440. The component has been used for less than 20% of its total lifespan,” the sources said.As per the DGCA, on February 1, an Air India B787-8 aircraft operating flight AI132 from London to Bengaluru experienced a fuel control switch issue. During engine start in London, the flight crew observed on two occasions that the switch did not remain positively latched in the “RUN” position when light vertical pressure was applied. The switch engaged correctly on the third attempt and remained stable. Before continuing with the rest of the procedure, the crew performed a physical verification to confirm that the switch was fully and positively latched in the “RUN” position.“No abnormality was observed during engine start or anytime thereafter. The operating crew member was briefed on the observation, unnecessary contact with the switch was avoided, and engine indications and alerting systems were closely monitored by the crew for the remainder of the flight, which was completed without any incident,” the statement read.Upon landing in Bengaluru, the matter was referred to Boeing, which recommended checking the serviceability of the fuel control switch, the DGCA added.In June last year, an Air India Boeing 787-8 was involved in a fatal crash in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, marking India’s worst aviation accident in three decades. Flight AI171 crashed shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad for London, hitting a nearby hostel. Of the 12 crew members and 230 passengers on board, only one passenger survived.

Budget 2026 Overview: What Citizens And Businesses Should Know

Punjab Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema on Monday alleged the BJP-led Centre of ""completely ignoring"" the state's needs in the Union Budget.There is no mention of Punjab anywhere in the budget and no reference to the long-pending rural development fund (RDF) of Rs 8,500 crore that is legitimately due to the state, Cheema said.Calling the budget ""anti-farmer, anti-education and anti-health"", the finance minister said the state has once again been pushed to manage on its own despite bearing the burden of national food security, facing the impact of repeated natural calamities, and responsibly handling RDF-related obligations.Cheema said the budget represents a ""deliberate attempt to derail"" the growth of Punjab, a state that has made unparalleled sacrifices for the nation.The finance minister said the state has been ""completely sidelined"" for the 12th consecutive year in the budget presented by the BJP-led central government.""The memorandum submitted by Punjab to the Union Finance Minister has been blatantly ignored. Punjab has always stood firm in the defence of the country and has not reduced its contribution to the central pool. In fact, our contribution has increased every year,"" he said.He added that because Punjab has continuously replenished the country's food reserves, 117 blocks of the state's groundwater have gone into the dark zone.Taking strong objection to the approach of the 16th Finance Commission, Cheema said the Centre has turned ""a blind eye towards the states"".""The poor financial condition of states has been completely ignored. The vertical devolution, which is the total share of all states in the tax pool, has been kept unchanged at 41 per cent. There is no increase at all despite the fiscal stress faced by states,"" he said.Cheema said that the 16th Finance Commission has not recommended any revenue deficit grants, whereas the 15th Finance Commission had done so.Conditions imposed on the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) are overly restrictive and will severely affect states like Punjab in effectively mitigating and managing disasters,"" he said.The Union government has once again ignored the legitimate concerns of Punjab's farmers, exposing its ""hollow claims"" of being pro-farmer, he said.""There is neither any increase in the agriculture infrastructure fund nor any concrete assistance to strengthen mandi infrastructure. There is absolutely nothing for farmers of Punjab,"" he said.""States will now be forced to do all this from their own funds.

NEW DELHI: Bihar, Assam and Chhattisgarh are among the frontrunners in the installation of smart electricity meters that provide consumers with near real-time consumption data through mobile applications, along with the convenience of recharge and historical usage graphs for optimisation.According to data tabled by minister of state for power Shripad Naik in Rajya Sabha on Monday, nearly 5.3 crore smart meters have been installed across the country under various schemes till Dec 2025, with Bihar covering over 86% of consumers, Assam 73% and Chhattisgarh 54%. The Centre launched the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) in July 2021 to help states and Union Territories improve the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of distribution utilities and provide quality and reliable power supply. Smart metering of consumers, distribution transformers and feeders was one of the key initiatives under the scheme.In his written reply, Naik said smart metering under RDSS was sanctioned for 45 distribution utilities in 28 states and UTs, covering 19.8 crore consumers, besides over 54.5 lakh distribution transformers and feeders. While 3.9 crore smart meters have been installed under RDSS, states and UTs also ran their respective schemes simultaneously, taking the total number to about 5.3 crore.States that are still lagging behind include Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, among others.Prepaid smart meters also help power distribution companies make advance revenue collections, resulting in improved efficiency, reduced receivables and enhanced cash flow. The minister said smart metering implementation also contributed, along with other measures, to bring down aggregate technical and commercial losses from 21.9% in FY2021 to 15% in FY2025.","Bihar, Assam and Chhattisgarh are among the frontrunners in the installation of smart electricity meters.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Tuesday issued a fresh travel advisory amid rising political tensions in Iran, announcing the cancellation of flights to and from Tbilisi, Almaty, Baku and Tashkent until February 28, 2026.In a statement, the airline said the decision was taken in view of the “developing situation around Iran” to ensure the safety of passengers and crew.The statement read: ""Travel Advisory In view of the developing situation around Iran, we have made additional adjustments to our flight schedule to ensure a safe and seamless experience for our customers and crew. As part of these measures, IndiGo flights to and from Tbilisi, Almaty, Baku, and Tashkent have been cancelled until 28 February 2026. As the situation continues to evolve, our plans remain under regular review. Any further updates or changes will be shared through our communication channels. We appreciate your patience, understanding, and continued trust.""The airline has been gradually extending the suspension of these routes. Earlier, flights to these destinations had been cancelled only until February 11.IndiGo operates these services by flying over Iranian airspace.Due to the current situation, it is avoiding the region. Flights from India to these cities usually take six to seven hours and are operated using A320neo aircraft, which do not have the range or fuel capacity to take longer alternate routes.Tensions between Iran and the United States have intensified in recent weeks, raising fears of a possible military conflict. The deployment of US naval forces in West Asia has drawn strong warnings from Tehran, which has said it would respond decisively even to limited military action.However, Iran’s president said on Tuesday that he had directed the country’s foreign minister to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” with the United States, signalling a possible diplomatic opening despite the heightened tensions.","IndiGo issues fresh travel advisory amid rising political tensions in Iran.

A Chance to Build a Future-Ready Indirect Tax System

(Jayashree Parthasarathy is Tax Partner, EY India. With contributions from Ketan Lohia, Director-tax, EY India)

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities.

IT stocks crash! Shares of Indian IT majors Infosys Wipro , HCL Tech, Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ), and Persistent Systems tanked in opening trade on Wednesday, dragging Sensex down by over 100 points. The decline was due to concerns about the growing impact of artificial intelligence which intensified following Anthropic’s launch of new workplace productivity tools.The negative sentiment mirrored weakness on Wall Street, where the technology-heavy benchmark Nasdaq declined 1.4 per cent, erasing nearly $300 billion in market capitalisation across the sector.Shares of major IT companies, including Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech and Persistent Systems, slid as much as 6 per cent in early trade.International brokerage Jefferies said in a February 2 report that it has cut back its allocation to the information technology sector as part of a reshuffle of its India model portfolio.Following the revision, the IT sector now carries a weight of 5.6 in Jefferies’ India portfolio, well below the 9.7 weighting assigned to the sector in the MSCI India index.The brokerage’s guarded approach comes amid persistent foreign portfolio investor selling, with overseas funds having withdrawn about $34 billion from Indian equities over the last 16 months, a period during which IT stocks have faced some of the heaviest pressure.US equities also reflected the technology-led weakness. The S&P 500 declined 0.84 per cent to settle at 6,917.81, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.43 per cent to 23,255.19.The Dow Jones Industrial Average proved relatively more stable, closing 0.34 per cent lower at 49,240.99.Among major stocks, Nvidia and Microsoft fell by nearly 3 per cent each. Alphabet slid 1.2 per cent ahead of its earnings announcement on Wednesday, and Amazon slipped 1.8 per cent before releasing its quarterly results on Thursday.Addressing market concerns, Anthropic clarified that its newly launched plugin is not intended to offer legal advice. “AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by licensed attorneys before being relied upon for legal decisions,” the company said. In addition to the legal-oriented tool, Anthropic unveiled a series of open-source offerings designed to automate a wide spectrum of professional activities, ranging from sales functions to customer service operations.Anthropic, established in 2021, was founded by chief executive Dario Amodei along with several former employees of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.","Shares of Indian IT majors Infosys Wipro, HCL Tech, Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ), and Persistent Systems tanked in opening trade on Wednesday.

Commerce ties between India and China achieved a new feat in 2025, scaling a record high bilateral trade of $155 billion. This reflects a year-on-year growth of more than 12%, according to Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong.Addressing a gathering to celebrate the Chinese New Year, Xu said that Beijing is in support for India’s BRICS presidency and is willing to enhance multilateral coordination with New Delhi. Furthermore, China is also committed towards working with India to advance the broader development agenda of the Global South, he said on Tuesday, as cited by PTI.The ambassador pointed to last August’s ""successful"" meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin as a key moment in improving ties. He said that the interaction helped move the relationship forward, including in the area of people-to-people exchanges.“Last August, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a successful meeting in Tianjin, which led China-India relations from ‘a reset and fresh start’ to a new level of improvement,” Xu said.He pointed out that interactions between the two countries at various levels have become more frequent.At the same time, economic and trade cooperation has also expanded significantly. “In 2025, bilateral trade between China and India reached a record high of $155.6 billion, registering a year-on-year growth of over 12%,” he said.Xu further highlighted the growth in India’s exports to China, which rose by 9.7% during the year, saying this underlined the strong potential for further economic cooperation.Touching upon development priorities, the envoy said that China’s push for self-reliance aligns with India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. He also drew a comparison between the two countries’ global outlooks. “At the global level, China’s vision of a ‘world of great harmony’ echoes Indian’s pursuit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family),” he said.“We stand ready to work with India to draw wisdom from our traditional cultures, uphold the important consensus that China and India are each other’s cooperation partners,” Xu said, stressing the importance of aligning development strategies to expand mutual benefits and achieve win-win results.Relations between the two countries have been improving in recent months, following efforts to revive ties that were severely strained after the June 2020 Galwan Valley clashes between Indian and Chinese troops.

CZI’s focus on Biohub

Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) – the philanthropy organisation founded by Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Prisicila Chan has cut roughly 8% of its workforce, reports Fortune. The job cut, impacting around 70 employees, comes as the company plans to expand its biomedical and science focus through Biohub. The move “underscores how big donors are racing to back science-heavy, tech-centric projects such as peers like the Gates Foundation,” the report said. For those unaware, Gates Foundation was founded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates. The foundation, which plans to shut down in 2045, has announced to donate a whopping $9 billion in 2026 alone “primarily focused on health care and disease research.”CZI aims to concentrate its resources on Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes that aims to “cure or prevent all disease. As explained in the Fortune report, the job cuts come as CZI is stepping “a little further back from its original focus areas of education, criminal justice reform, housing, and community development” and “now needs employees with expertise in their new coverage areas”.The laid off employees will get 60-days notice period along with a severance package with 16 weeks of base pay, health insurance, and a $10,000 stipend.Biohub is a nonprofit biomedical research organization founded by Chan and Zuckerberg to help scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Established in 2016 Biohub is a key part of CZI and has an operating budget of about $1 billion per year. Since its inception, the couple has donated $4 billion to basic science research, and aims to double it in the next decade.Speaking during an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City in November last year, Zuckerberg said “I feel like the science work that we’ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done”. “So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,” quoted an Associated Press report then.In a November 2025 blog post, the couple wrote “We will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives. There will be many challenges, but we believe that achieving some of humanity’s long-term dreams will also come within reach.”In a related news, Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisation. The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget. To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce by 500, including by leaving some positions unfilled.","The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) has cut roughly 8% of its workforce.

Tampa Bay Rays ownership outlines funding commitment

""There's still great work ahead of us to be able to bring this to reality, but what I can say with certainty is that we believe with conviction... That we're going to be able to create a world-class work-live-learn-play development here in Tampa Bay,""

State and league leaders map out next steps

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred met Tuesday to discuss the newly unveiled plans for a potential new home for the Tampa Bay Rays. The two leaders are to meet at the Hillsborough College campus site on Dale Mabry Highway, which is now being evaluated for a new ballpark and redevelopment project.The two sharing the screen only intensified the focus on the Rays staying long-term in the Tampa Bay area. Team executives, local officials, and league representatives have been working to bipartisanize replacing St. Petersburg's Tropicana Field with a new venue in Tampa. Despite growing excitement surrounding the proposal, there are notable financial and logistical challenges that could prevent a definitive agreement from being reached. The conference is expected to start at 10 am EST. The Rays hope to complete an agreement with HC within the next six months and plan to hold the inaugural game at the new ballpark on Opening Day 2029.Rays ownership pointed to its willingness to cover a large portion of that cost at a new stadium at the same time during the presentation. As part of the current proposal, the organization has committed to covering at least half of the total cost, and more if project costs increase.The team leaders also stated they would handle upkeep and upgrades down the line after the facility was built.Then, the balance of the project would go to local governments to be funded by ""a blend of tourism development tax, hotel assessments and other specific sources,"" state officials said. Under the existing structure, officials have stressed that no general county tax dollars would be used. Proponents of the proposal contend that a new stadium complex would drive thousands of dollars in economic activity and further bolster the area’s standing as a premier sports market.the Rays CEO said.Governor DeSantis did not go as far as issuing a commitment for state funds for the stadium itself, but he did express openness to helping out with other associated requests. There is a reference to possible state assistance, such as renovations to transportation facilities and in transferring existing college facilities located where the proposed campus would be. Given that the land is owned by the state, any project would entail significant interagency collaboration.But just because the Rays are looking for a new stadium doesn't mean they intend to leave Tampa Bay. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred reiterated the league's preference to keep the franchise in a permanent location. A new facility is vital for the franchise to be competitive and for the health of the league, he said. Local leaders reiterated that message while also urging the need for taxpayer safeguards and transparency throughout the process.","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred met Tuesday to discuss the newly unveiled plans for a potential new home for the Tampa Bay Rays.

Wildlife board clears 400kV power transmission upgrade in Bengaluru tech hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wildlife-board-clears-400kv-power-transmission-upgrade-in-bengaluru-tech-hub/articleshow/127900254.cms,"



BENGALURU: A recent clearance granted by State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) has paved the way for uninterrupted quality power transmission to the fast-growing technology corridor in eastern parts of the city. The longpending approval revived a crucial power upgrade project aimed at replacing the nearly 40-year-old 400kV transmission line that connected Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, and also linked eastern Odisha as part of the national grid.Commissioned in 1980s, the existing 400kV transmission line stretching between Somanahalli on Kanakapura Road and Mylasandra in Electronics City long served as a major power lifeline for eastern Bengaluru. Over the years, the same line was extended to connect additional receiving stations at Hoodi, Narasapura and Kolar. Further, the corridor was used for transmitting power to parts of Rayalaseema in Andhra Pradesh. However, rapid urbanisation, mushrooming of mega technology parks, multinational companies and large residential projects along east Bengaluru significantly increased the load on the line, pushing it beyond its designed capacity.A senior engineer from Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd (KPTCL) said, “The existing transmission line is a critical source for the 400kV Mylasandra substation, which handles transmission of 1,500 MW to 2,000 MW of power on a daily basis. Due to the increased load, the station reported low-voltage issues, and ensuring quality power supply became a challenge. Further, any tripping of this line due to overload could potentially lead to cascading tripping of the entire 220 kV network within Bengaluru, severely affecting power supply. ”While KPTCL initiated the project involving the erection of 24 towers and stringing of nearly 10km of transmission line, the work ran into hurdles as two of the proposed towers were located within Bannerghatta National Park (BNP). In addition, the project required destringing of existing transmission lines passing through the forest, necessitating approvals from both SBWL and National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). The proposal also faced strong opposition from conservationists, who expressed concerns that the new transmission line could pose risks to the elephant population within BNP.In response to these concerns, KPTCL engineers informed SBWL that no additional forest land would be sought and the height of the towers proposed inside the park would be increased to minimise disturbance. “We decided to replace the existing two towers at the same locations and also replace 1km of the deteriorated conductor that was installed nearly 40 years ago. We apprised the board that the height of the conductors will be increased by an additional 10 metres. Besides, we proposed reducing the right of way (RoW) of the corridor from 52 to 46 metres, thereby minimising the environmental impact,” said a KPTCL official.KPTCL also assured the wildlife board that, contrary to the standard ground clearance of 8 to 10 metres, the upgraded line will have a ground clearance of 15 metres, making it difficult for elephants to come into contact with the conductors. “Based on the revised design and mitigation measures proposed by KPTCL, we recommended the proposal to NBWL, subject to certain conditions,” a forest official said.","The longpending approval revived a crucial power upgrade project.

Explained: What is Anthropic's AI tool that wiped $285 billion off software stocks in a single day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/audio/explained-what-is-anthropics-ai-tool-that-wiped-285-billion-off-software-stocks-in-a-single-day/articleshow/127892310.cms,"A swift market reaction, dubbed 'SaaSpocalypse,' saw software stocks plummet by $285 billion after Anthropic's AI assistant, Claude Cowork, launched new plugins. The legal workflow automation plugin, in particular, triggered a selloff in legal tech and broader software sectors. Analysts now fear AI platforms are becoming direct competitors to existing software providers.

What exactly did Anthropic release

Why the market panic over a folder of prompts

What does this mean for the software industry going forward

Anthropic's newly launched AI plugins have triggered what analysts are calling a 'SaaSpocalypse'—a brutal selloff that wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single trading session. The AI developer, known for its Claude chatbot, released 11 open-source plugins for its Claude Cowork tool on Friday, January 30. One of them targets legal workflows, and that alone was enough to send investors running for the exits.Thomson Reuters dropped over 15%. RELX, owner of LexisNexis, fell 14%. LegalZoom got hammered nearly 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket tracking US software stocks posted its worst single-day decline since April's tariff-driven selloff. The Nasdaq fell 1.4%, with ripple effects extending to Indian IT giants—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5% and Wipro fell nearly 5%.Claude Cowork is an agentic AI assistant that Anthropic launched earlier in January. Think of it as Claude Code—the company's developer-focused coding tool—but redesigned for non-technical professionals. It can read files, organise folders, draft documents and carry out multi-step tasks with user consent.The plugins announced last Friday supercharge this capability. They let companies tailor Claude to specific job functions by specifying how work should be done, which tools and data to pull from, and what workflows to automate. Anthropic open-sourced 11 starter plugins covering productivity, sales, marketing, finance, data analysis, customer support, product management and biology research.But it was the legal plugin that spooked markets. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings. Anthropic was careful to note that all outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys and that the tool does not provide legal advice. That disclaimer did little to calm investors.Here's the thing that has caught many observers off guard: the legal plugin is essentially a set of prompts and configurations. There's no proprietary model fine-tuned on case law, no special legal reasoning engine. It's Claude being Claude, but with structured workflow instructions.The real signal, analysts say, is that Anthropic has moved from selling the model to owning the workflow. When Claude was just an API, companies like Thomson Reuters could build on top of it. Thomson Reuters literally runs CoCounsel on OpenAI. But when Anthropic starts publishing ready-made vertical solutions, the platform becomes the competitor.Jefferies dubbed the selloff a 'SaaSpocalypse', noting that investor sentiment has shifted dramatically. The narrative used to be that AI helps software companies. Now it's that AI replaces them. 'Trading is very much get-me-out style selling,' said Jeffrey Favuzza from Jefferies' equity trading desk.The damage extended well beyond legal tech. DocuSign fell 11%, Salesforce dropped nearly 7%, Adobe slid 7%, and ServiceNow declined 7%. Business development companies with exposure to software loans also got caught in the selling. Blue Owl Capital Corp fell 13%, marking a record ninth consecutive decline.Anthropic isn't the only player in legal AI. Startups like Harvey AI (valued at $5 billion) and Legora ($1.8 billion valuation) have been developing tools for years. But Anthropic's advantage is that it builds its own underlying models. Firms like Legora rely on models from developers like Anthropic, which means Claude's creator can potentially disrupt both traditional legal services and the startups trying to disrupt them.The iteration speed is also striking. Cowork launched on January 12. The plugins dropped less than three weeks later. Enterprise software companies typically spend quarters on such releases.For software executives watching the carnage unfold, the takeaway is uncomfortable but clear: Anthropic didn't need a breakthrough product to rattle markets. It just needed to show what Claude could already do—and hit publish.","Anthropic's AI assistant, Claude Cowork, launched new plugins.

The Indian alternative investment landscape is currently witnessing a tectonic shift. It is evolving from a capital-starved ecosystem into one of the world’s most dynamic markets for private capital. As the third-largest startup ecosystem globally, home to over 1.57 lakh recognised startups, India has firmly established itself as a formidable engine of innovation and entrepreneurshipHowever, the headline numbers tell only half the story. While the sheer volume of activity is impressive, with the private equity market projected to reach approximately $232.7 billion by 2030, the nature of the game is changing fundamentally. The ""growth-at-all-costs"" mentality that defined the previous decade is rapidly giving way to a new era of disciplined value creation, operational rigor, and strategic exits.For finance professionals, corporate leaders, and aspiring investors, this transition presents a double-edged sword. On one hand, the opportunities are unprecedented. The demand for skilled fund managers is being driven by a massive influx of domestic capital, with commitments to Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) surging to INR 14.2 trillion($160.8 billion) as of June 2025, a 20% year-on-year growth. On the other hand, the bar for entry has been raised significantly.The industry no longer needs just capital allocators. It demands sophisticated investment professionals who can navigate the complexities of deal structuring, manage distressed assets, and drive tangible portfolio growth in a volatile macroeconomic environment.To help meet this growing demand, the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIML) consistently ranked among India’s top five business schools and globally recognised for academic excellence, has launched the Venture Capital and Private Equity (VCPE) Programme in collaboration with Emeritus.Moving beyond generalist financial training, this high-impact course provides the specific, high-level toolkit that emerging leaders need to thrive in India’s complex investment landscape.The standout feature of the programme is the Capstone Project, which serves as a comprehensive simulation of fund management. Participants act as fund managers tasked with raising capital, deploying it across a diversified portfolio, and managing the lifecycle of their investments. This exercise forces learners to make difficult trade-offs and balance risk and return under conditions of uncertainty, exactly as they would in a live fund.Furthermore, the programme includes Applied VCPE Workshops and simulation games that bring concepts to life. Whether it is negotiating a contentious clause in a term sheet or deciding whether to double down on a struggling portfolio company, participants are constantly challenged to apply their learning in dynamic scenarios.The Campus Immersion component adds another layer of value. By spending time on the IIM Lucknow campus, participants not only engage deeply with renowned faculty but also build a powerful network of peers. In an industry where ""who you know"" is often as important as ""what you know,"" this access to a cohort of ambitious finance professionals, founders, and corporate leaders is a significant career asset.Designed for working professionals, the programme blends academic rigour with flexibility.Real-world simulations: Features like the Valuation Lab and Capstone Project ensure that skills are road-tested before being applied in the market.To ensure a high-quality peer learning environment, the programme maintains specific entry requirements:The Indian VC and PE market is entering a phase of maturity that will separate the generalists from the specialists. As the ecosystem marches toward a $232 billion valuation, the demand for leaders who can combine financial acumen with strategic foresight will only intensify.Whether you are looking to break into the buy-side, scale your family office, or lead corporate acquisitions, the IIM Lucknow Venture Capital and Private Equity Programme offers the intellectual capital and practical skills to accelerate your journey.1. https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2098452®=3&lang=22. https://iqeq.com/insights/indias-alternative-investment-industry-comes-of-age/3. https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/india-private-equity-market","The Indian alternative investment landscape is witnessing a tectonic shift.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
