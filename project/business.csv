NEW DELHI: India has stepped-up work on fencing the 1,643-km porous border with Myanmar, which will be completed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in phases over the next 10 years.The ongoing ambitious project will entail around Rs 20,000 crore being spent on the fence itself and another Rs 11,000 crore on construction of over 60 border roads.""As per the survey conducted by govt agencies, over 1,500-km of fencing - which includes 300-km of electric fencing - is required for effective management of the India-Myanmar border as well as ensuring security and stability of India's north-east region,"" Army sources told TOI.The fencing comes at a time when there are still no signs of normalcy returning to conflict-torn Manipur, where over 250 people have been killed in ethnic violence between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities since May last year.While over 60,000 people have been internally displaced, less than half of the around 6,000 weapons looted in the state have been recovered forces so far by security.The volatile situation in Myanmar amid the fighting between the military and armed opposition outfits over the last one year, subsequent to the coup in Feb 2021, has also led to over 31,000 people fleeing and seeking refuge in India.""Myanmar's ongoing instability has further aggravated the situation, with a surge in smuggling, human trafficking and movement of armed infiltrators. Drugs worth Rs 1,125 crore, for instance, have been seized along the border in the last six-seven months,"" a source said.Some communities in Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, all of which border Myanmar, have however strongly opposed the proposed fence as well as scrapping of the ' Free Movement Regime ', which allowed people residing along the border to venture 16-km into each other's territory without visas, earlier this year.Apex Kuki bodies, for instance, say the twin steps ""threaten to infringe upon the cultural, traditional and historical rights of indigenous communities"".Some experts have also criticised the ""costly"" move, stressing it will cause hardships to people who share ethnic ties across the border as well as disrupt closer connectivity, trade and people-to-people ties.The defence and security establishment, however, contends the fencing does not intend to restrict the movement of civilians or sever cultural and familial connections on either side of the border.""A network of gates with biometric systems along the fence is being planned to allow cross-border movement, while ensuring security. The locations of these entry and exit points will be decided through collaborative consultations with local residents,"" another source said.The fencing's primary objective is to curb ""the movement of armed groups"", as well as stem the smuggling of weapons, drugs, human trafficking and illegal immigration, he added.The ""success"" of the 10-km fencing completed in Moreh (Manipur) underlines the project's potential to improve both security and trade management.""The fencing will also regulate and boost legitimate trade, ensuring economic benefits for the local communities while eliminating the adverse impact of illegal trade,"" he said.","India has stepped-up work on fencing the 1,643-km porous border with Myanmar.

The BCI has also instructed its Secretary to approach the CBI to verify the authenticity of the degree and investigate possible fabrication of related records.The BCI revealed that a sub-committee was constituted earlier this year to investigate the matter following directions from the Delhi high court. The inquiry found several discrepancies in the records provided. Among them was the fact that PMB Gujarati Arts and Law College, Indore, was not authorized to conduct an LLB (Hons) course during the relevant period. Moreover, the LLB (Hons) program itself was introduced under Bar Council regulations only in 2008, raising doubts about the legitimacy of the degree purportedly issued two decades earlier.BCI said that the further scrutiny of the academic records revealed signs of tampering, with uniform handwriting and ink consistency over extended periods.The BCI, citing its authority under the Advocates Act, 1961, resolved to adopt the inquiry report and removed Nasiar from his post pending the outcome of the CBI investigation .This comes months after the Delhi high court in August dismissed a petition challenging the authenticity of Nasiar’s degree. Justice Rajiv Shakdher, while delivering the judgment, relied on a verification report from the concerned university that declared the degree genuine.

NEW DELHI: Tensions within Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) continue to simmer, with Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Aaditya Thackeray hitting out at the Maharashtra unit of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and its chief, Abu Azmi, for the intention to withdraw from the alliance over "" Hindutva credentials.""""Our Hindutva is aboutRam in the heart and work in the hands)... Our Hindutva is about taking everyone together,"" Aaditya Thackeray said.While the Shiv Sena leader consicoulsy refrained from targeting SP chief Akhilesh Yadav , he accused the SP Maharashtra unit of working in tandem with the BJP. ""Akhilesh Yadav ji is fighting his fight, but the SP here (Maharashtra unit) sometimes behaves like the B-team of the BJP,"" he said.The rebuke from Thackeray followed the announcement by Maharashtra SP chief to pull out of the MVA alliance, citing a social media post by a Shiv Sena (UBT) legislative council member known to be close to party chief Uddhav Thackeray Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Milind Narvekar had shared a social media post featuring an image of the Babri Masjid demolition alongside a quote from Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray: ""I am proud of those who did this."" The post also included pictures of Uddhav Thackeray and his son, MLA Aaditya Thackeray.This drew a response from Maharashtra SP chief Abu Azmi, who said that his party could no longer remain in the MVA, accusing Shiv Sena (UBT) of taking pride in those responsible for the Babri Masjid demolition.""After losing elections, they have changed their ideology. If this continues, the MVA won't survive. SP contested 8 seats and won 2, yet MVA fielded candidates against us in 7 constituencies. Uddhav Thackeray instructs his workers to focus on Hindutva. Those responsible for the Babri Masjid demolition, an act labeled as criminal by the Supreme Court on December 6—a black day—are being congratulated. SP is secular. How can we work with a party that uses communal language?"" Azmi said.However, the Samajwadi Party's national leadership distanced itself from Azmi's remarks. ""Abu Asim Azmi is a senior leader of the Samajwadi Party in Maharashtra, but decisions about the party's alliances are made by the national leadership,"" an SP spokesperson later said.The development comes amid growing discord in the INDIA bloc nationally over a host of issues and especially following Congress's dismal performance in assembly polls in Haryana and Maharashtra.","Tensions within Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) continue to simmer.

NEW DELHI: In one of the single-biggest restitution exercises undertaken by ED , involving the 32 lakh victims of the Agri Gold ponzi 'scam', the agency has begun the sale of attached properties , worth over Rs 6,000 crore, across multiple states.With the concurrence of the Supreme Court and the Andhra Pradesh HC, favouring distribution of attached 'proceeds of crime' to poor investors, ED last week moved a special PMLA court in Nampally, Hyderabad, against the Agri Gold group of companies and their promoters, seeking to dispose of the attached properties located in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Odisha.In the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, PM Narendra Modi had said he was exploring options of changing the law, if necessitated, to reimburse victims of frauds by using seized assets of perpetrators of scams.However, there is already a provision under section 8(8) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act , under which attached assets confiscated by ED can be restored to ""a claimant with a legitimate interest in the property, who may have suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of the offence of money laundering"". ED's panchnama for such transfer of attached property may be used as evidence during trial, according to the law.""The attached assets for which application has been filed by ED for their sale and restoration include 2,310 residential and commercial plots, apartments as well as an amusement park, Haailand, at Chinnakakani in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur district,"" a senior official said. Out of the 2,310 attached properties, 2,254 are in Andhra Pradesh, 43 in Telangana, 11 in Karnataka and two in Odisha.Earlier, the Andhra Pradesh HC had allowed restitution of properties attached by CID under provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments (APPDFE) Act.""Since the objectives of the APPDFE Act and the PMLA, insofar as restitution of properties to victims is concerned, are not contradictory to each other, and since the process of restitution in terms of section 6(4) of the APPDFE Act could also be done in terms of section 8(8) of PMLA, the matter went up to the Supreme Court, which while keeping the question of law open, ruled in favour of disbursal of the attached amounts to the depositors,"" the official said.The agents of Agri Gold scheme collected more than Rs 6,400 crore from 32 lakh customers. Andhra Pradesh CID, which had filed the predicate offence against the accused in 2018, had moved the HC earlier, seeking release of ED attachment so that it could distribute the money to the victims.Agri Gold group and its promoters Avva Venkata Rama Rao and his family members Avva Venkata Seshu Narayana and Avva Hema Sundara Vara Prasad were arrested by ED in Dec 2020.

NEW DELHI: A group of former deputy CAGs have approached the Supreme Court through a PIL seeking interpretation of Article 148 of the Constitution by prescribing a collegium system for appointments of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) - a constitutional position that enjoys the same status as a judge of the apex court.In both cases, their appointments are by the President, have retirement age fixed at 65 and where removal from office entails impeachment by both Houses of Parliament.The veterans of Indian Accounts & Audit Service also challenged the vacuum in Article 148, which prescribes the appointment of CAG but lacks any specified procedure. The petitioner (Anupam Kulshreshtha vs Union of India case) quoted from Constituent Assembly debates, where Ambedkar asserted the importance of CAG as ""the most crucial officer in the Constitution"" and that its duties should be as independent as those of the judiciary, free from any executive or legislative influence. The collegium, as suggested by the PIL, should comprise the speaker of Lok Sabha, LoP in Lok Sabha, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (a position held by an opposition leader) and the CJI or his nominee.At present, a panel of names is suggested by the cabinet secretary to the PM who then recommends his selection to the President. The absence of a prescribed procedure by way of a selection committee, criteria and qualifications for appointments, etc is against the constitutional mandate, the petition said. The petition, signed by three deputy CAGs - Anupam Kulshreshtra, Arun Kumar Singh and Sangita Chandrakant Choure - was listed twice since Jan but is yet to come up for hearing as govt is yet to file its response to the notice served by the SC.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116030.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana govt can enact rules to regulate installation and operation of mobile towers and impose fees as well, ordered a full bench of Punjab and Haryana high court.Telegraph Act does not override state govt's legislative competence to enact or promulgate legislation and rules, court added.Justices Lisa Gill, Sudhir Singh, and Suvir Sehgal passed the order on Friday while examining the legislative competence of a notification issued by Haryana govt on April 12, 2012. It had inserted several sections in Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, and Haryana Panchayati Raj (Regulation of Communication Towers) Rules, 2012. It also included impugned notices issued by state authorities calling upon cellular companies to deposit fees for erecting communication towers. The court upheld state govt's legislative competence to frame such rules. However, the court said the validity of provisions regarding the quantum of levy were within the division bench's domain.Cellular companies had claimed that to provide services to public, it was required to erect mobile towers on rooftops of buildings and/or ground-based mobile towers. They said the location of mobile towers are based in a scientific survey, which takes into account requirements such as signal strength and mobile phone users' needs for connectivity.","Telegraph Act does not override state govt's legislative competence to enact or promulgate legislation and rules, court added.

GUWAHATI: The current unrest in Manipur has significantly hit campus placements at NIT-Manipur, with recruitments dropping to 50% so far for the 2025 UG batch, compared to 85% two years ago for the 2023 batch.However, IIIT Manipur continues to successfully conduct IT sector recruitment through virtual means.NIT-Manipur director DVLN Somayajulu Sunday told TOI several companies have delayed in-person recruitment, while five firms declined virtual recruitment citing internal policies. ""Our institution is trying to facilitate physical mode of recruitment. We are optimistic that the situation will improve.

Our placement division is exploring the possibilities of pool recruitment in collaboration with networked institutions, with arrangements to conduct recruitment drives either in Guwahati or Kolkata,"" he said.Somayajulu reiterated that the institute is persuading recruiters to conduct virtual recruitment and HRs are examining this possibility. He, however, added that a network with full-fledged internet connectivity and without disruptions is essential. ""We are striving to resolve this from our end,"" he said.In the 2023 batch of NIT-Manipur, 118 out of 138 (85.5%) students landed jobs during campus placements.

For the 2025 batch so far, 70 out of 140 applicants have been placed, while 10 more companies are scheduled to hold recruitment drives in the next two months.""Very few PSUs have visited us this time thus far. We are hoping for more companies to participate in the next semester,"" Somayajulu said.However, officials said placements in IT sectors have not encountered such impediments since virtual recruitment is feasible. This has been reflected in case of IIIT Manipur.""This year, out of 46 aspiring students of our institute, 39 secured campus placements and seven will obtain positions shortly. Their recruitments are in progress. In virtual mode, all have been recruited in IIIT Manipur because our students are from electronics and communication engineering and computer science and engineering streams. Virtual recruitment is readily achievable in their case,"" Krishnan Baskar, director of IIIT Manipur, another premier institute in the trouble-torn state, said.""Since our students were predominantly aspiring for IT sector positions, recruitment through virtual mode is not problematic.

NEW DELHI: Every year, on a specific day, some hospitals affiliated with medical colleges admit healthy individuals as patients. This trick is employed to deceive inspection teams that come to assess the facilities for granting approval to establish a new medical college or to increase the number of MBBS seats in an existing one. In many cases, the hospitals succeed in their deception.Recently, there have been multiple recorded instances of medical colleges hiring fake or non-serious patients to meet the minimum standards required for grant of a license to operate or to increase the number of MBBS seats. Recognising this problem, NMC has, for the first time, issued detailed guidelines on how to identify fake patients.NMC guidelines state that if the assessor observes a large number of patients admitted on the day of assessment or the previous day, it could indicate fake admissions . Similarly, if the admitted patients have ailments that can be treated in the OPD with oral medications, those should also be considered fake admissions. Another criterion described by NMC to identify fake or ghost patients is admission without any evidence of investigations, such as X-rays, blood tests, etc., either before or after admission.In pediatric wards, NMC guidelines add that fake patients can be identified if assessors find that most of the admitted children are playful and cheerful without any significant medical issues. One such instance was recorded when a medical college in Maharashtra applied to increase its MBBS intake, but all the children in the pediatric ward were ""hale and hearty.""Another red flag includes the admission of multiple patients from the same family or those admitted through preventive health checkups/camps, which may indicate fake patients.The practice of admitting fake patients to fulfill bed occupancy requirements or other criteria has been a long-standing issue. If assessors note these irregularities, it will be considered a violation of NMC guidelines. In 2019, SC had barred a medical college in Bhopal from admitting new students for two years after it was found guilty of admitting fake patients.","Some hospitals affiliated with medical colleges admit healthy individuals as patients. This trick is employed to deceive inspection teams that come to assess the facilities for granting approval to establish a new medical college or to increase the number of MBBS seats.

Extensive anti-drone system soon to secure borders: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extensive-anti-drone-system-soon-to-secure-borders-amit-shah/articleshow/116115612.cms,"Amit Shah address (PTI photo)

JODHPUR: Highlighting that the menace of drone intrusions from across the border is set to grow, home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said a “laser-equipped, anti-drone, gun-mount system”, jointly developed by the border guarding forces, ministry of defence, DRDO and other govt R&D departments, at the testing stage, enabled the neutralisation of 55% drones along the Punjab border, as against 3% earlier.Sharing the “very encouraging” outcome of trials of the indigenously-developed anti-drone mechanism, Shah, during his address at the BSF’s 60th Raising Day event here, underlined that various govt departments had worked in tandem as part of “whole of govt” approach to assess the threat from drones and accordingly developed the solution.“I am sure that in the next few years, we will establish a comprehensive anti-drone unit that will effectively secure our borders,” he said.As many as 257 drones – including 250 on the western border alone -- were recovered or shot down by the BSF till Nov 30 this year as against 110 in 2023. BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary, while highlighting the sustained use of drones by elements across the western border to smuggle drugs and weapons into Indian territory, shared on Sunday that the force’s drone forensic laboratory had examined 190 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) shot down or recovered by BSF personnel over the past year and had shared the results with the concerned agencies.Shah said the govt had earlier, as part of its constant efforts to improve border management, developed a comprehensive integrated border management system (CIBMS), which integrates manpower, sensors, networks, intelligence and command control solutions to detect, soft-kill and hard-kill drones. A CIBMS pilot project was undertaken in Dhubri, Assam. “The initial results are very encouraging. But the system needs some improvements. We will make the necessary upgrades and extend CIBMS to the entire western and eastern borders,” said Shah.The home minister said the Narendra Modi govt had brought clarity of approach to border security , and was pursuing an integrated border management policy based on ‘one border, one force’ principle introduced by the A B Vajpayee govt. “Our border policy strives to secure borders, develop border infrastructure and roads on our side and ensure 100% saturation of welfare schemes in the border villages,” he said. It is as part of this approach here that the govt is implementing the Rs 4800-crore Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP), targeted at all-round development of villages on the Indo-China border, particularly those prone to outmigration, while ensuring a good quality of life to their residents.Shah said 591 km of unfenced stretches on the border with Bangladesh have been fenced, floodlights installed along 1,159 km and 573 border outposts and 579 observation posts constructed. “As many as 1812 km of border roads were constructed in remote areas to improve connectivity,” shared Shah.Also, land ports were being developed to promote legal trade with the neighbours and promote people-to-people connections.Praising BSF personnel for strengthening the country’s first line of defence with their courage, valour and sacrifice, Shah said achieving Prime Minister Modi’s vision of a fully developed India by 2047 was impossible “without the bravery and dedication of our soldiers”. The govt, he said, was also taking care of welfare of BSF personnel and their families through measures like the Ayushman CAPF scheme, under which 41 lakh Ayushman cards had been issued and claims worth Rs 1,600 crore settled thus far.To increase the troops housing satisfaction ratio, the govt had approved 13,000 houses and completed the construction of 11,000 over the past 5 years. An additional 111 barracks were also built and vacant houses were being allotted through the CAPF e-housing portal, informed Shah.During the Raising Day event, Shah reviewed the ceremonial parade, took salute and awarded gallantry medals to BSF personnel.","Amit Shah: Laser-equipped, anti-drone, gun-mount system enabled neutralisation of 55% drones along the Punjab border, as against 3% earlier.

NEW DELHI: Escalating its charge of a ""nexus"" between Congress and billionaire George Soros, BJP on Sunday turned the focus on former party president Sonia Gandhi and said she had links to an organisation that had advocated Kashmir as a ""separate entity"".The party accused Sonia of being in collusion with the 94-year-old currency speculator and hedge fund operator, and claimed that they shared a mutual objective of diminishing India's growth. ""Sonia Gandhi, as the co-president of Forum of Democratic Leaders in Asia Pacific (FDL-AP) Foundation, is linked to an organisation financed by the George Soros Foundation. Notably, FDL-AP Foundation has expressed their views that treat Kashmir as a separate entity,"" BJP posted on X.Sonia Gandhi’s chairmanship of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation led to a partnership with the George Soros Foundation, displaying the influence of foreign funding on Indian organisations,” BJP further alleged. It also pointed to the involvement of Salil Shetty, vice-president of the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations, in the Congress-led ‘ Bharat Jodo Yatra ’, where he was seen alongside Rahul Gandhi BJP accused Rahul of leveraging the Soros-funded Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) for his press conference on the Adani Group, claiming, “It shows nothing but their strong and dangerous relationship and highlights their attempts to derail the Indian economy.” The party further noted a common stance between Soros and Rahul on the Adani issue, with both suggesting that the Adani matter could lead to the Modi govt’s downfall.” Besides, BJP also shared posts highlighting Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s acknowledgement of Soros as an “old friend” to further strengthen its narrative of a deep-seated connection. Despite several attempts, a response from Congress could not be obtained.BJP’s allegations are poised to spark intense debates when Parliament reconvenes on Monday, with party MP Nishikant Dubey declaring his intent to question Rahul.Vowing to pose 10 questions, Dubey said, “I have repeatedly reviewed the statement from US embassy officials. They acknowledge that the US govt funds OCCRP, alongside Soros’s foundation. OCCRP and Soros are allegedly working to undermine India’s economy and tarnish the Modi govt’s reputation in collusion with opposition functionaries. After yesterday’s statement, I am compelled to ask my 10 questions in Lok Sabha to Rahul Gandhi. The opposition is attempting to silence me in Parliament. Under Lok Sabha Rule 357, I have the right to ask these questions. I am waiting for tomorrow.”Dubey’s queries include whether Salil Shetty’s participation in the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ was funded by Soros, and whether Rahul met with US politicians linked to the Soros Foundation who advocate the division of India. He also plans to question the nature of past meetings between Soros and Congress figures, including historical connections like that of Fori Nehru, and the financial support Soros might have provided to the children of Congress functionaries under the guise of startups.","Sonia Gandhi is linked to an organisation financed by the George Soros Foundation, says BJP.

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges.

Visa Rejections for Indian Tourists Soar as Dubai Tightens Entry Rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/visa-rejections-for-indian-tourists-soar-as-dubai-tightens-entry-rules/articleshow/116087560.cms,"Pune: Travel agencies are reporting an unprecedented rise in visa rejections for Indian tourists looking to travel to Dubai, following stricter requirements for tourist visa applications to the Gulf city, creating widespread uncertainty and financial losses for travellers.Rishikesh Pujari, director of Vihar Travels, said, ""We are seeing unprecedented rejection rates (for tourist visa applications to Dubai). Earlier, almost 99% of Dubai visa applications were approved. Now, we are experiencing rejections even for well-prepared travellers. I had a family of four who meticulously prepared their application, attaching all relevant documents like confirmed hotel bookings and flight details. Despite this, their visa application was rejected.""In another case, a large group of 35 individuals found their meticulously planned Dubai trip completely derailed when one family member's visa application was rejected, resulting in financial losses. Travellers are losing money not just on visa fees, but also pre-booked flight tickets and hotel reservations. ""In just one week, I have seen nearly eight rejections,"" Pujari said.The new regulations require extensive documentation like hotel bookings and return tickets. For those staying with relatives, additional proof of accommodation is needed by the latter. All these requirements have caught many travellers off guard.Vijay Thakkar, director of Hasmukh Travels, told TOI: ""Two of our passengers recently had their Dubai visa applications rejected. They were planning to stay with relatives in Dubai. While applying for the visa, we had attached all the relevant documents as per the new visa requirements. Yet, their applications were rejected. This resulted in significant monetary loss for the passengers, as they had spent nearly Rs 14,000 on visa fees, and ticket cancellation cost was another Rs 20,000 and more.""Nikhil Kumar, director of Passio Travels Pvt Ltd, said, ""Earlier, the rejection rate for Dubai visas was just 1-2%. This is before the new rules were enforced. We are now getting at least 5-6 visa rejections per day from nearly 100 applications daily. Even when confirmed flight tickets and hotel stay details are attached, the visa applications are being rejected.""He said, ""In cases where travellers are staying with relatives in Dubai and we attach mandatory documents like the host's rental agreement, Emirates ID, residence visa copy and contact details, visas are getting rejected. In all of these cases, the clients have already paid for confirmed flight tickets and hotel bookings.""In another instance, Kumar said, ""A husband and wife applied for Dubai visas, but the wife's visa was rejected while the husband's was approved, despite having identical documents for hotel and flight tickets. Their tickets were non-refundable.""A Pune traveller who had planned to visit his relatives in Dubai with his brother told TOI: ""The visa fees were non-refundable, and our flight tickets were non-refundable too. We spent around Rs 50,000 on a two-way flight, and now that money is gone to waste. We had attached all the relevant documents as per the new requirements while applying for the visa, yet our plan stands cancelled as our visas were rejected.""Nilesh Bhansali, president of Travel Agents Association of Pune, said, ""After stricter requirements for Dubai tourist visa applications were introduced, many people are attempting to attach dummy flight tickets or fabricated documents. This is never recommended. Dubai is extremely strict, and a rejection can potentially create lifelong travel complications to the destination. My advise to travellers is to avoid any dummy tickets or hotel bookings.""","The new regulations require extensive documentation like hotel bookings and return tickets.

Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, is taking a hands-on approach to the company's future, devoting 95% of his time to artificial intelligence initiatives . Although he stepped down as CEO three years ago, Bezos highlighted his enduring commitment to Amazon’s growth and innovation during the DealBook Summit on Wednesday. This intensified focus on AI reflects his dedication to advancing one of the most transformative technologies of our time and underscores his continued influence on Amazon’s strategic vision.""My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there and my love is there,"" Bezos said, emphasizing his ongoing involvement. The world's second-richest man is particularly focused on helping Amazon become a leader in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, with the company currently developing 1,000 internal AI applications.A key strategic move involves building a powerful supercomputer in collaboration with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. This initiative aims to provide Amazon with significant computing capabilities to compete against other tech giants, like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, in the AI race. The company is reportedly developing a multimodal AI model capable of processing images, video, and text.While Bezos stepped down as CEO in 2021 to concentrate on Blue Origin, his rocket company, he remains Amazon's executive chairman. He continues to support current CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team, mirroring a trend seen with other tech founders like Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who returned to assist with AI initiatives.Bezos is optimistic about the company's future, drawing parallels to other tech leaders reinvesting in their original companies during the AI revolution. His deep engagement suggests Amazon is positioning itself as a serious contender in the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence market.""I'll always be there to help, and right now, I'm putting a lot of time into it,"" Bezos said, adding, ""It's super interesting, so why not?""Last month, Bezos's net worth reached a record high of $228 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This surge was attributed to an increase in Amazon's stock price, which hit a record $207.09 per share after the recent US election results. Bezos, who owns almost 9% of Amazon, saw his wealth increase by $7 billion.","Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, is devoting 95% of his time to artificial intelligence initiatives.
