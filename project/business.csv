NEW DELHI: An Air India Express flight IX-196 flying from Dubai to Jaipur, with 189 passengers onboard, received a bomb threat via email during the wee hours of Saturday. However, authorities have confirmed that nothing suspicious was found after the plane landed at the Jaipur International airport .""After a thorough check by the security forces , nothing suspicious was found,"" Jaipur Airport Police SHO Sandeep Basera said news agency ANI.This comes after a Vistara 's Delhi-London flight of October 18 was diverted to Frankfurt late on Friday night due to a similar hoax call.

"Post the Supreme Court judgment, 6 takes on 6A",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-the-supreme-court-judgment-6-takes-on-6a/articleshow/114364753.cms,"What is the case?



What is the impact of the verdict?



What happens to CAA?



What happens to those on the ground?



What can be the political outcome?



A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court upheld Section 6A of the Citizenship Act , 1955, which makes March 25, 1971, the cut-off date for Indian citizenship in Assam. Section 6A was introduced to give effect to the 1985 Assam Accord , which in turn was the result of a six-year-long student-led movement against illegal infiltration from Bangladesh into Assam. However, the 4:1 majority verdict, while settling some issues, gives rise to other questions, especially in the context of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), 2019.Here are six takeaways from the 6A judgment:Petitioners in the case — including Assam Public Works and Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha — argued that Section 6A was discriminatory because it provided a different cut-off date for citizenship for immigrants entering Assam as opposed to the rest of the country. This needs to be seen in the context of the push from certain sections to revert to 1951 as the cut-off in Assam. Petitioners argued that Section 6A had led to demographic change in the state, threatening ‘indigenous’ people’s rights and culture.What Did SC Majority Verdict Say?The three-judge majority opinion penned by Justice Surya Kant for himself and Justices MM Sundresh and Manoj Misra held that the migrant situation in Assam was unique compared to the rest of the country and that enacting a law to specifically address the issue would not violate the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution. CJI DY Chandrachud said in his separate but concurring opinion that application of Section 6A to Assam was reasonable given the magnitude of the migration issue in that state, even though other Indian states may have larger borders with Bangladesh and, in some instances, seen greater influx of migrants. Further, CJI Chandrachud found the cutoff date of March 25,1971, reasonable as it was on that day the Pakistani army had launched Operation Searchlight to crack down on the Bengali nationalist movement in the erstwhile East Pakistan.The verdict settles the debate about the cut-off date for detecting illegal migrants in Assam once and for all. It has also put paid to efforts to push back this date to 1951. Note that Assam govt had recently accepted 1951 as the cut-off year for implementation of certain recommendations of the Justice Biplab Sharma Committee on Clause 6 of the Assam Accord to safeguard the interests of the state’s indigenous people. The committee was set up in 2019 in the wake of the widespread protests against CAA. It now remains to be seen how Assam govt squares its policies to preserve “cultural and linguistic heritage” of Assamese people with SC’s judgment.Anti-CAA groups have seized on the SC verdict to demand that CAA be scrapped. All Assam Students’ Union, which had spearheaded the anti-illegal immigrant agitation in the 1970s and 80s, has welcomed the verdict, saying it clears the decks for the full implementation of the Assam Accord. Does this mean that the citizenship cut-off date of Dec 2014 for non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan as provided for by CAA now stands in potential conflict with the SC-backed Section 6A cut-off of March 25, 1971?True, SC did not delve into CAA in this ruling, but it clearly rejected the argument that permitting people with a different culture to reside in Assam would dilute Assamese culture. This has implications for the legal challenge against CAA pending before SC.That’s the million-dollar question. The NRC exercise has already given 31 lakh people papers. CAA is being implemented. In this scenario, identifying, detecting and deporting illegal migrants according to the March 25, 1971, cut-off — which SC will now monitor — is practically unfeasible. It will possibly open another can of political worms and lead to more legal challenges and questions.The verdict is certainly a shot in the arm for the opposition in Assam and anti-CAA groups and a blow to Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma. The latter will now be forced into further political jugglery over CAA on the one hand and the demand on the other for going back to the 1951 cut-off, which stemmed from dissatisfaction over the NRC exercise among Assam’s ‘nativist’ groups. BJP saw CAA as a boon for its politics. Himanta has to cater to local aspirations to continue in office. But SC’s verdict, upholding a clear cut-off date for citizenship in Assam, may trouble both Himanta and his party, in different ways.","A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court upheld Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which makes March 25, 1971, the cut-off date for Indian citizenship in Assam.

One bomb hoax can cost an airline over Rs 3 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-bomb-hoax-can-cost-an-airline-over-rs-3-crore/articleshow/114364615.cms,"Costs adding up



‘Financial Terrorism’



An Air India Boeing 777 took off from Mumbai this Monday (October ober 14) with almost 130 tonnes of jet fuel in its tanks for a 16-hour nonstop journey to New York’s JFK airport. Soon after take-off, the airline received a call saying there was a bomb in the plane. JFK-bound AI 119 was immediately diverted and within two hours of take-off, it was preparing to land in Delhi.But there was a problem.“The maximum landing weight of a B777 is 250 tonnes. A full flight like this weighs about 340-350 tonnes with passengers, baggage and cargo on take-off. Landing within two hours means dumping about 100 tones of fuel. At almost Rs 1 lakh per tonne, the fuel wastage cost alone works out to Rs 1 crore,” said a senior pilot.Add to it other expenses like the unexpected landing and parking charges at IGI Airport, putting up over 200 passengers and crew in Delhi hotels, compensating them later for missed connections, grounding of aircraft before it can be back in service after thorough checks and arranging a fresh pair of operating crew, and the aircraft not reaching JFK to fly passengers from there to India on a scheduled return flight — the total cost of this one hoax threat works out to way over Rs 3 crore, say senior officials.The spate of hoax threats since last Sunday — close to 40 by late Thursday — is having a massive financial impact on airlines. Rough estimates by airline officials peg the extra expense at about Rs 60-80 crore.Take the case of Air India B777 (VT-ALM) that took off from Delhi this Tuesday (October 15) for Chicago. Twelve hours later, the aircraft with over 200 passengers on board landed in the remote Canadian town of Iqaluit after a bomb threat. The aircraft landed there on October 15 at 5.21 am EDT. The next commercial flight it flew was three and a half days later. First it reached Chicago from Iqaluit as a ferry flight — with no passengers as the stranded passengers had been flown earlier to Chicago on a Canadian Air Force A330 for which AI will pay — and then took off as a commercial flight to Delhi at 5.15 pm on October 18.The average monthly rental of a B777 is between $400,000 and $600,000 — this works out to an average daily rental of about $17,000. Not flying means $17,000 down the drain every single day. Now, had it not been for the hoax threat, the aircraft would have reached Chicago and then after a few hours, left for Delhi as a regular flight. But not reaching Chicago meant over 200 passengers and crew stranded in Iqaluit for whom accommodation, meals and other basic necessities had to be arranged in a remote town. Then flying them to Chicago on a Canadian Air Force plane. And, meanwhile, having to deal with Delhi-bound passengers in Chicago’s O’Hare Airport whose aircraft didn’t show up because it was stranded in Iqaluit. The overall cost of this one threat would run into over Rs 15-20 crore, including the cost of a B777 grounded for that long, said multiple people.No big airline that has been a victim of these threats in the last few days commented on this issue. “This is the peak festive rush season and we don’t want to create a scare among travellers. Suffice it to say that this is a sort of financial terrorism against airlines and should be dealt with severely,” said a senior airline official.IndiGo, too, has got threats for several flights, both domestic and international. Ve ry often when a flight gets a threat message and is not diverted. The destination airport asks it to hold or hover. This has happened with AI in London, AI Express in Singapore, and perhaps others too. “A B777 burns 7-8 tonnes of fuel every hour and an A320 2.5 tonnes. At Rs 1 lakh per tonne and two hours of hovering, the cost of fuel burn alone is over several crores for all affected airlines,” said a pilot.“Due to the extra time spent in air, very often the same crew can’t operate the next flight this aircraft will operate after being cleared by security agencies post checks. They will need to be rested and given hotel accommodation in that city. It has not been uncommon to have aircraft out of action for 20-25 hours during these crazy hoax message times. While this a force majeure event beyond our control, many passengers who miss connections will take us to court and eventually we will have to settle by paying damages,” said a senior official of a big airline.Making matters worse is the fact there are two types of threats. A specific one where a particular flight number is named or a generic one like the one Air India got on Thursday, saying five AI flights have bombs in them.“Risk assessment is done. The source of the threat is seen, whether it came via X (former Twitter), WhatsApp, call or mail. Based on an evaluation matrix, the code is decided — whether red (very serious), amber (serious) or green (most likely hoax). But in no circumstances is any threat dismissed as it is better to be safe, even if it means losses and angry passengers, than sorry,” said an official.In cases assessed to be serious, flight have to land at the nearest suitable airport. “To avoid oversight landings, we can dump fuel when the aircraft is holding at over 5,000 feet. Fuel jettisoned from that altitude will vapourise. In Delhi, we dump a little south of the capital near Sakras and in Mumbai over the sea, ” said a pilot.","The spate of hoax threats since last Sunday — close to 40 by late Thursday — is having a massive financial impact on airlines. Rough estimates by airline officials peg the extra expense at about Rs 60-80 crore. “This is a sort of financial terrorism against airlines and should be dealt with severely,” said a senior airline official.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114364609,imgsize-971078,width-400,resizemode-4/114364609.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Actor Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the ' HPZ Token ' mobile app in which several investors were allegedly duped on the pretext of mining Bitcoins and some other cryptocurrencies.The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the 34-year-old actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at its zonal office in Guwahati.Sources said Bhatia received some funds for making a ""celebrity appearance"" at an event of the app company and there were no ""incriminating"" charges against her.She was called earlier too but she deferred the summons due to work and chose to appear on Thursday, they said.A total of 299 entities, including 76 Chinese-controlled entities in which 10 directors are of Chinese origin while two entities are controlled by other foreign nationals, have been named as accused in the charge sheet filed by the ED in this case in March.The money laundering case stems from an FIR of the cyber crimes unit of Kohima Police that booked various accused under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Act for allegedly duping ""gullible"" investors by promising astronomical returns by mining Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.Police said the 'HPZ Token' mobile phone application was used by the accused to ""cheat"" the investors.The agency said bank accounts and merchant IDs were opened by various ""shell entities"" having ""dummy"" directors for the purpose of ""layering"" the proceeds of crime.These funds were ""fraudulently"" received for illegal online gaming and betting and investment for Bitcoin mining , it claimed.For an investment of Rs 57,000, returns of Rs 4,000 per day for three months were promised but money was paid only once and thereafter fresh funds were sought by the accused from the investors, the ED said.Country-wide searches were undertaken by the ED in this case leading to the seizure of immovable assets and deposits worth Rs 455 crore, it said.",Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the'HPZ Token'mobile app. The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114332903,imgsize-39750,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114332903.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Canada may have taken the plea of free speech and cited legal requirement for more proof to act against pro-Khalistan extremists' alleged political persecution to find sanctuary in its territory, but the country has failed to act on India's requests even for the extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape.This has turned the country into a ""safe haven"" for criminals wanted in India, government sources said.Sources here pointed out that no action has been taken against one Gurcharan Singh, accused in a cheating case, although a request was made in 2003. Similarly, Omkar Mal Aggarwal, accused of criminal conspiracy and cheating in a property case, has been wanted since 2016, while India sought the extradition of Jasvinder Pal Singh Walia in 2022 in a case related to gang rape and blackmail of a female employee of his spa during 2014-15, which is pending. Last year, a plea was made against Ravinder Singh for cruelty against his wife, after he fled the country.Sources said there are formal and informal channels via which information is exchanged but a common thread is there - reluctance on part of Canadian authorities.On several occasions, India has suggested that the Canadian government check the antecedents of individuals who enter the country illegally and later seek asylum, but the suggestion has been ignored. Even the caution that the ""open door"" policy is a recipe for disaster, as those who have profited from crime are going to ply their dark trade in their new home, has not been heeded. ""Nor have the instances vindicating the warning,"" said a senior source.In the case of terrorists and criminals, Indian authorities have shared call details and even the location of suspects and suggested that action could be taken under Canadian laws but complained that they have always hit a wall.Sources also dismissed the grounds of ""higher bar"" and ""due process"" refrained by Canadian agencies to justify their action against terrorists entering the country camouflaged as ""dissenters who are facing prosecution for political reasons"" as just an alibi, saying the concerns have never come in the way of tough action against operatives and sympathisers of IS and their family members. ""The indifference and resistance to our requests... has been visceral and has been the norm since 2003,"" said the source.In fact, after years of informal sharing of information and dossiers, which Canada said didn't meet their legal requirements, a formal arrangement was worked out between NIA and RCMP but there has not been much headway.Even in the 1980s when militancy was at its peak in Punjab, Canada under then PM Pierre Trudeau, Justin's father, harboured Khalistani terrorists, including those involved in murders and bombings, including that of Kanishka that killed hundreds of passengers.In recent years too, as Sikh extremists decided to make Canada as their base for anti-India activities, government repeatedly flagged its concern and shared evidence, including links with Pakistan, but has not met with much success. What has raised further eyebrows in New Delhi is how many extremists accused of serious terror charges have even been given official assignments.","Canada has failed to act on India's requests even for the extradition of fraudsters and those accused of drug dealing, domestic violence and rape. India has suggested that the Canadian government check the antecedents of individuals who enter the country illegally and later seek asylum, but the suggestion has been ignored.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114337450,imgsize-1445987,width-400,resizemode-4/114337450.jpg"

Artificial stones pose deadly silicosis risk to workers: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/artificial-stones-pose-deadly-silicosis-risk-to-workers-study/articleshow/114364387.cms,"NEW DELHI: Artificial stone, also known as engineered stone or quartz , may make your kitchen look beautiful but, leading medical experts from across the globe warn it is endangering the lives of workmen involved in its cutting and polishing.Artificial stones are made from crushed rocks bound together with resins. It has aesthetic appeal. It's easier to work with due to absence of natural imperfections, and it's more resistant to damage than natural stone - leading to its popularity over the past decade.However, according to a recent study published in journal Thorax, its increasing popularity has been accompanied by the emergence of a severe and rapidly progressive form of silicosis (artificial stone silicosis), largely driven by its high (more than 90%) silica content compared with marble (3%) and granite (30%), and the fine dust it generates when cut.""When worktops are prepared for installation, they are often 'dry' cut and polished with an angle grinder or other tools without the use of water to suppress dust generation, further boosting the volume of fine dust,"" the researchers explain.The Thorax study documents eight cases of workers with an average age of 34 suffering from serious lung disease while preparing artificial stones in the UK. Of them, two were assessed for lung transplant; three for autoimmune disease and two others were treated for opportunistic lung infection caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria, the Thorax study states.The UK is currently reviewing exposure limits for crystalline silica dust amid mounting international concerns about its health impacts. ""Inhalation of silica, a common mineral found in sand, is known to cause scarring of lungs and predispose a person to tuberculosis. I used to see several construction workers suffering from both at Safdarjung Hospital. The degree of illness varied depending on the duration of exposure,"" Dr J C Suri, the former head of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said.Dr Suri said cutting and polishing of artificial stones leads to release of fine silica dust that are likely to be inhaled compared to the silica dust released while cutting or polishing other materials used for making kitchen tops, for example granite. ""Doing away with the use of these stones may be difficult, but one can certainly advocate safety measures for workers involved in the cutting, polishing and installation of these stones to reduce the risk of silicosis - lung disease caused by breathing in tiny bits of silica. This may include use of nasal filters and tech-use to reduce exposure to silica dust,"" he added.","Artificial stones are made from crushed rocks bound together with resins.

MUMBAI: In a night-long operation, Mumbai crime branch arrested five suspected members of the Maharashtra module of Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang allegedly involved in the killing of NCP politician Baba Siddique , taking the total arrests to nine.Three of them — Sambhaji Parthi (44), Pradeep Thombre (37), Chetan Pardhi (27) — are from Ambernath.Nitin Sapre (32) was picked up from Dombivli and Ramphoolchand Kanojia (43) from Panvel.Police said Sapre and Kanojia were tasked with the hit on Siddique.The plan was later dropped — sources said they demanded Rs 50 lakh-Rs 1 crore as supari, and Sapre developed cold feet on finding out who the target was.An official said Sapre claimed that on finding out how influential Siddique was, “he got scared and understood the consequences and convinced Kanojia to stay away”.The handlers then decided to use the north India module for the job and chose Gurmail Singh, Shivkumar Gautam and Dharmaraj Kashyap,” said the official. While Singh and Kashyap carried out the hit and were caught the same night a little distance, Gautam is on the run.The five from the Maharashtra module are suspected of supplying weapons, including Turkish, Australian and locally made pistols, to the shooters. They also arranged logistics, accommodation and financial support for the killing, said a senior crime branch official. “When Kashyap and Gautam arrived in Karjat, their accommodation was arranged by these arrested accused in mid-Aug.This group had provided logistics and money to the shooters. In mid-Sept, these accused provided three weapons, which have been seized, to the killers. We are also probing if the five arrested accused had visited Mumbai before Siddique’s killing,” said the officer. All five were produced before a court Friday evening and remanded in police custody till Oct 25. Mumbai police Friday suspended constable Shyam Sonawane who was on duty guarding Baba Siddique when he was shot dad. Sonawane, from the protection branch, failed to respond when bullets were fired at Siddique.Sonawane told cops that the accused used pepper spray and burst crackers and hence, he became confused. “He said he could not see due to the smoke, which hindered him from taking defensive action,” said a cop.","Mumbai crime branch arrested five suspected members of the Maharashtra module of Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang allegedly involved in the killing of NCP politician Baba Siddique.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) to citizens irrespective of their religion and personal laws but suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.Delivering a 141-page judgment on a PIL highlighting the persistence of child marriages on an alarming scale despite enactment of PCMA 18 years ago, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, “The issue of the interface of personal laws with the prohibition of child marriage under PCMA has been subject of some confusion.”Union govt, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, had in a written note on behalf of WCD ministry submitted that there were conflicting opinions of HCs on precedence of PCMA over personal laws.“SC may consider issuing directions pronouncing that PCMA will prevail over the personal law governing marriage,” it requested.Authoring the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said Centre has not provided details of conflicting judgments from HCs and that PCMA was silent on the validity of child marriages. “Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced on Dec 21, 2021. The bill was referred for examination to department-related standing committee. The bill sought to amend PCMA to expressly state the overriding effect of the statute over various personal laws. The issue, therefore, is pending consideration before Parliament,” SC said, refraining from ruling as requested by Centre.However, it laid down elaborate guidelines to strengthen measures to prevent child marriages. The CJI-led bench widened the scope of issue before its consideration to bring in betrothal of minors, and said PCMA was silent on this issue. “Marriages fixed in the minority of a child have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood. It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. International law such as CEDAW stipulates against betrothals of minors,” it said.“Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the JJ Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,” the apex court bench added.Appreciating efforts of advocate Mugdha, appearing for the NGO ‘Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action’, in bringing to the court’s notice loopholes in implementation of PCMA, the bench said a studied approachby all stakeholders was needed for prevention of child marriages and protection of minors while penalising approach for violation of PCMA should be last resort.",Supreme Court spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) It suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.

What is Vikash Yadav accused of?

What are the charges against Vikash Yadav?

The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) on Thursday issued a wanted poster for Vikash Yadav , a former Indian government employee, in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US citizen.India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had previously confirmed that Yadav, named in the US Justice Department 's indictment, is no longer employed by the Indian government.According to a wanted poster by FBI, Yadav, second Indian to be named in the conspiracy, was born in Haryana in 1984 and was known by the names Vikas and Amanat to communicate with co-conspirator Nikhil Gupta, who had earlier pleaded 'not guilty' to the charges.The US justice department said that Vikash was employed by the Cabinet Secretariat, which houses the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of India's foreign intelligence service. ""Yadav has described his position as a 'senior field officer' with responsibilities in 'security management' and 'intelligence.' Yadav also has referenced previously serving in India’s Central Reserve Police Force and receiving 'officer training' in 'battle craft' and 'weapons.'The US department said that Yadav recruited Gupta to orchestrate the assassination of Pannun. ""At Yadav’s direction, Gupta contacted an individual whom Gupta believed to be a criminal associate, but who was in fact a confidential source (the CS) working with the DEA, for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder the victim in New York City. The CS introduced Gupta to a purported hitman, who was in fact a DEA undercover officer (the UC). Yadav subsequently agreed, in dealings brokered by Gupta, to pay the UC $100,000 to murder the victim. On or about June 9, 2023, Yadav and Gupta arranged for an associate to deliver $15,000 in cash to the UC as an advance payment for the murder. Yadav’s associate then delivered the $15,000 to the UC in Manhattan,"" the press release said.Yadav then allegedly provided Gupta with personal information about Pannun, which Gupta then passed to the DEA undercover. ""Yadav directed Gupta to provide regular updates on the progress of the assassination plot, which Gupta accomplished by forwarding to Yadav, among other things, surveillance photographs of the victim. Gupta directed the UC to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but Gupta also specifically instructed the UC not to commit the murder around the time of the Indian Prime Minister’s official state visit to the United States,"" it said.""The day after the Nijjar murder, Gupta told the UC that Nijjar 'was also the target' and 'we have so many targets.' Gupta added that, in light of Nijjar’s murder, there was 'now no need to wait'. Yadav then sent Gupta a news article about the victim and messaged Gupta, “[i]t’s [a] priority now,"" said US.Yadav and Gupta of India have been charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison; and conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.A federal district court judge will determine any sentence, considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other factors.

NEW DELHI: Leader of People’s Party of Canada , Maxime Bernier , on Thursday claimed that Hardeep Singh Nijjar , whose murder has led to deteriorating diplomatic ties between India and Canada, was 'a foreign terrorist' who was 'somehow granted citizenship in 2007.'Bernier wrote on X, ""One myth should be dispelled though: That the central figure in this controversy, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Khalistani militant who was murdered last year, was a Canadian.He was actually a foreign terrorist who used fraudulent documents to claim asylum in Canada several times starting in 1997. His claims were rejected but he was nevertheless allowed to stay in this country and was somehow granted citizenship in 2007.""Calling it an administrative error, Bernier said that Nijjar should have been deported along with thousands of others who used 'fake asylum claimants.' ""Nijjar wasn’t a Canadian. We should perhaps posthumously take away his citizenship to right this administrative error. He should have been deported after his first fake asylum claim, like the hundreds of thousands of fake asylum claimants who are in Canada right now,"" wrote Bernier.""All this is happening because Canada has for decades deliberately invited these foreigners and their tribal conflicts into our country. We should recognize this major blunder and work with the government of India to find solutions instead of jeopardizing our relations with a rising world power and an important ally over this issue,"" Bernier said.The opposition leader criticised Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , accusing him of 'using this crisis to divert attention from other controversies.' He added, however, that if the allegations are proven true, they must be addressed seriously.He however said that, ""If true, allegations made by the RCMP and the Liberal government that Indian diplomats participated in criminal activities on our territory are very serious and should be dealt with. So far however, we haven’t been given any proof. And Trudeau is clearly using this crisis to divert the attention from other controversies.Relations between India and Canada plunged to a new low after the Canadian authorities accused Indian agents of involvement in 'homicides, extortion and violent acts' targeting pro-Khalistan supporters and even attempted to link the Bishnoi gang to unspecified criminal activities on Canadian soil.

Born in 1984 in Haryana, Yadav is an Indian national based in India and used 'Amanat' as an alias when communicating with his co-conspirator, another Indian national, to facilitate the murder plot, according to the information mentioned on the wanted poster released by FBI.Sikh separatist Pannun is linked with Sikhs for Justice, a New York-based group advocating for the secession of Punjab from India. The justice department said Yadav directed the plot and hired Gupta to find a hitman.Earlier, Nikhil Gupta, 53, pleaded not guilty after being extradited from the Czech Republic in June. The justice department claimed that Gupta contacted someone he believed was a criminal associate, who turned out to be a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).Anne Milgram, the DEA chief, stated, ""Yadav, an employee of the Indian government, used his position of authority and access to confidential information to direct the attempted assassination of an outspoken critic of the Indian government here on US soil.""The justice department press release said that in June 2023, Yadav provided Gupta with personal information about Pannun, including his address in New York City, phone numbers and details on day-to-day activities, which Gupta then passed to an undercover officer of DEA. ""Yadav directed Gupta to provide regular updates on the progress of the assassination plot , which Gupta accomplished by forwarding to Yadav, among other things, surveillance photographs of the victim. Gupta directed the undercover to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but Gupta also specifically instructed the undercover not to commit the murder around the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official state visit to the United States on June 20, 2023,"" said US.This comes amid souring of diplomatic relations between India and Canada over terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was murdered outside a Gurudwara in British Columbia.US further claims that a day after Nijjar murder, Gupta told the undercover officer that Nijjar 'was also the target' and 'we have so many targets.' ""Gupta added that, in light of Nijjar’s murder, there was 'now no need to wait' on killing Pannun. Yadav then sent Gupta a news article about the victim and messaged Gupta, “[i]t’s [a] priority now.”Attorney general Merrick Garland added, “As alleged, last year, we foiled an attempt by Vikash Yadav, an Indian government employee, and his co-conspirator, Nikhil Gupta, to assassinate an American citizen on US soil. Today’s charges demonstrate that the justice department will not tolerate attempts to target and endanger Americans and to undermine the rights to which every US citizen is entitled.”The United States reported on Wednesday that India had informed them that the accused intelligence operative was no longer in government service. State department spokesman Matthew Miller said, ""They did inform us that the individual who was named in the Justice Department indictment is no longer an employee of the Indian government. We are satisfied with the cooperation.""","Vikash Yadav, 39, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering. Yadav worked for Cabinet Secretariat, which includes the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ), the country's foreign intelligence service. The justice department said Yadav directed the plot and hired Gupta to find a hitman.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114333040,imgsize-689647,width-400,resizemode-4/114333040.jpg"

Context of Discussion



Johnson's Interest and Concerns Over Maxx Crosby

Sharpe's Faith in the Trade

The Chance of Shedeur Sanders with the Raiders

All that was about to remain was for Tom Brady to vocally confirm that he was not retiring, and ""the football world"" would have its everyday gossip over with, at least until the divorce public news broke out concerning his separation from Gisele Bundchen in 2022, by when he famously declared, ""I've never quit on anything in my life."" Even then, his eventual choice seemed apt at the time.On the latest episode of “Nightcap”, Shannon Sharpe and Chad ""Ochocinco"" Johnson went at it talking about the NFL . Sharpe dropped a fascinating idea: he believes that the Raiders need to draft Shedeur Sanders from college football. He said he has the draft pick of the Lions and is willing to trade up because he said, ""For a second, I would trade the first, because I know where I'm going to be picking; it's gonna be way down."".This discussion was established in the backdrop of whether or not the Raiders should drop the season and start anew. Johnson inquired to Sharpe if this was what he meant by saying they'd have to ""tank"" the season and thus rebuilt. Sharpe said it was true and brought out that a new season, accompanied by drafting Shedeur Sanders, would improve the team with a twin boom.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest He loved the idea as presented by Sharpe. It had a chance of being worked out. He brought up an issue about Maxx Crosby, who is part of the circulating rumors of being traded. Johnson also brought up that Crosby could go to the Lions and strengthen their defense dramatically. Sharpe retorts that it could get him a second-round pick for Crosby, but Johnson maintains that Crosby is worth a first-round pick.To make his point clearer, Sharpe was bold enough to claim that he would trade for the second-round pick because it was a late pick. This will consequently bring Crosby to the Lions to replace Aidan Hutchinson whom they lost, and this will also give the Raiders a chance to draft Shedeur Sanders so that they can break their long-standing curse of not having a good quarterback.Could the Raiders draft Shedeur Sanders? Possibly, as the quarterback apparently did meet with Raiders owner Mark Davis on 4 October. What sounds like a more informal meeting happened during the WNBA semifinals rather than any official draft meeting, but it appears to add another layer to this unfolding narrative.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","Shannon Sharpe and Chad ""Ochocinco"" Johnson discussed the NFL on ""Nightcap"" Sharpe believes the Raiders need to draft Shedeur Sanders from college football.

More job cuts coming

Intel has begun implementing mass layoffs that it announced back in August, impacting more than 2,000 jobs across several US states. The company says these workforce reductions are part of its broader cost-cutting measures.According to multiple reports, the job cuts will affect approximately 1,300 employees in Oregon , 385 in Arizona, 319 in California, and 251 in Texas.The impact is particularly significant in Oregon, where Intel is the second-largest private employer with over 20,000 workers. The affected employees in Oregon are based at facilities in Aloha and Hillsboro.The job cuts are set to begin on November 15, with employees receiving either a 60-day notice or a four-week notice with additional pay and benefits.These layoffs are part of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger 's plan, announced in August, to eliminate over 15,000 jobs globally and reduce costs by more than $10 billion. The company aims to streamline operations in response to worsening financial conditions and increased competition in the semiconductor industry. So, more job cuts across more regions are expected.An Intel spokesperson confirmed that these job cuts are necessary steps to create ""a leaner, simpler, and more agile company"" positioned for long-term sustainable growth.The layoffs come alongside other strategic changes, including delays in opening new facilities outside the United States and restructuring its contract chip manufacturing business.","More than 2,000 employees in Oregon, Arizona, California, and Texas will lose their jobs.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Bangladesh interim government says polls possible in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/best-of-the-week/world/bangladesh-interim-government-says-polls-possible-in-2025/articleshow/114364836.cms,"DHAKA : Bangladesh interim govt’s law adviser Asif Nazrul said Thursday that “realistically speaking” parliamentary election could be possible only by next year after all poll-related preparations are completed.“There are many factors. This is a preliminary assumption to me,” he said during a television programme. The interim govt now wants to proceed with forming a new election commission through a “search committee”, which will be formed soon.The new election commission, once established, will prepare an updated voters’ list. However, there is no indication yet whether the biggest political party, Bangladesh Awami League , will be allowed to participate as cases against its top members are piling up.The govt is moving fast to try top Awami leaders, including deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and general secretary Obaidul Quader. A domestic court has ordered the authorities concerned to arrest them and produce them before a court by November 18.The interim govt says Hasina should be handed over to Bangladesh in accordance with its extradition treaty with India. But Dhaka fears that Delhi may raise a provision that the allegations brought against her were not brought in “good faith”.","Bangladesh interim govt’s law adviser Asif Nazrul said “realistically speaking’ parliamentary election could be possible only by next year after all poll- related preparations are completed. “There are many factors.

When can we expect the

Robotaxi Network

?

Just when it seemed like Elon Musk had achieved the impossible after his SpaceX caught a booster rocket, we now have the a fully self-driving cab without a driver, a pedal, a steering wheel, or any other sort of manual intervention. Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport .The event, held at Warner Bros. Discovery studios, featured the self-driving vehicle navigating an artificial city environment, specially designed for the showcase. Although the Cybercab is not yet ready for public roads, its reveal sparked excitement and raised questions about the future of autonomous technology .The Cybercab’s design immediately stands out, with its sleek, pod-like shape and futuristic butterfly doors that open upward. The interior, completely devoid of traditional controls like a steering wheel or pedals, feels like something straight out of a science fiction film. Its spacious, minimalist cabin is controlled through a touchscreen interface, further enhancing its futuristic appeal.Despite its sci-fi aesthetic, there are practical concerns about how the vehicle will handle the unpredictability of real-world driving. In the controlled environment of the studio, the Cybercab moved effortlessly, gliding through streets that mimicked a real city.However, it’s unclear how well the vehicle would perform in a more chaotic setting with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians or cyclists.During the demonstration, the Cybercab did show signs of situational awareness , stopping instantly when someone stepped into its path, indicating that it can detect and respond to its surroundings. This suggests that Tesla has made significant progress toward achieving full autonomy, though there is still a long way to go before such vehicles are ready for widespread use.While the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are clear, including reduced human error and greater accessibility for those unable to drive, concerns remain. Questions about how these vehicles will handle complex, split-second decisions in real-world scenarios persist. Additionally, the ethical and safety implications of allowing machines to take full control of the driving process are still being debated.Tesla’s Cybercab represents a bold step towards the future of transportation. While it offers a glimpse of what might be possible, there are still many challenges—both technical and societal—that must be addressed before fully autonomous vehicles become a part of everyday life. For now, the Cybercab serves as a compelling vision of a future where mobility is redefined, but its role in that future remains to be determined.Tasha Keeney, ARK Invest ’s Director of Investment Analysis & Institutional Strategies, has suggested that Tesla’s Robotaxi Network could launch as early as 2025 or 2026. Keeney believes that Tesla might not need to wait for the Cybercab to roll out its Robotaxi Network.Both Keeney and Cathie Wood, ARK Invest’s CEO, attended Tesla’s “We, Robot” event on 10th October, where they waited to ride in the newly revealed Tesla Cybercab , which is intended to be central to the Robotaxi Network.However, Keeney and her colleagues at ARK Invest are of the view that Tesla could launch the network without the Cybercab. She argued that Tesla already possesses a fleet of vehicles equipped with Hardware 3 and 4, which could achieve full autonomy via over-the-air software updates.Even if Tesla opts to wait until the Cybercab is ready for fully autonomous rides, ARK Invest has suggested that the company could still introduce the Robotaxi Network using human drivers. In 2020, ARK Invest released an article explaining why it would be advantageous for Tesla to launch the network with human drivers first.ARK argued that a ride-hailing network would boost Tesla’s profitability before the robotaxi service becomes operational. Furthermore, they suggested that launching the robotaxi service would not require significant engineering resources, aside from crucial tasks such as routing, payment integration, and other necessary functions.ARK also noted that a vertically integrated ride-hailing service using highly efficient electric vehicles would increase the proportion of miles driven on electric platforms, furthering","Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport.

: The statement accompanying the indictment filed by US department of justice against former RAW operative Vikash Yadav in connection with the alleged plot to assassinate pro-Khalistan extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York also suggested Washington is making an example of the episode to broadcast a larger message to other nations, notably China and Russia, which have also been accused of conducting transnational operations against dissenters they regard as anti-national.Today's charges are a grave example of the increase in lethal plotting and other forms of violent transnational repression targeting diaspora communities in the United States, the statement said, adding: To the govts around the world who may be considering such criminal activity and to the communities they would target, let there be no doubt that the DoJ is committed to disrupting and exposing these plots and to holding the wrongful actors accountable no matter who they are or where they reside.According to the indictment, in or about May 2023, Yadav recruited Nikhil Gupta , an Indian national allegedly involved in international narcotics and weapons trafficking, to orchestrate Pannun's assassination. At Yadav's direction, Gupta contacted an individual whom Gupta believed to be a criminal associate, but who was in fact a confidential source (CS) working with the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder the victim in New York City.The CS then introduced Gupta to a purported hitman, who was in fact a DEA undercover officer, it said. Yadav subsequently agreed, in dealings brokered by Gupta, to pay the hitman $100,000 to murder the victim, of which $15,000 in cash was delivered to the undercover agent as an advance. The indictment contained a close-up photo of the money changing hands.The indictment said Nikhil Gupta also instructed the undercover agent not to commit the murder around the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official state visit to the US, which was scheduled to begin on June 20, 2023. Yadav's recruitment of Gupta to orchestrate the hit job was in exchange for assistance in securing the dismissal of a criminal case against Gupta in India, it said.Gupta was arrested in Prague earlier this year and extradited to the US, where he has pleaded not guilty ahead of an expected trial.","Indictment filed by US department of justice against former RAW operative Vikash Yadav in connection with alleged plot to assassinate pro-Khalistan extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York.

The identity of the buyer, who participated in the private sale, remains undisclosed.The auction lasted just over seven minutes, with bids increasing by $500,000 intervals mainly over the phone. The highest bid was $9 million.Auctioneer Andrew Brunk was quoted by the Associated Press saying, “Just another second or two. Savor it a little bit selling here at nine million.” He further added, ""It's a privilege to have it here. It's been quite a ride.""The auction, initially scheduled for September 28, was postponed due to the catastrophic damage caused by Hurricane Helene across Asheville and western North Carolina.The rare document dates back to 1787 when it was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the nation's framework and sent it to the Congress under the Articles of Confederation . This copy is one of about 100 printed by Charles Thomson, the Congress secretary, with only eight known to exist today. The other seven are publicly owned.The document was discovered two years ago during the clearing of a property in Edenton, North Carolina, which was once owned by Samuel Johnston , North Carolina's governor from 1787 to 1789. It was found in a metal filing cabinet in a neglected room.This Constitution copy includes a letter from George Washington urging ratification. He wrote about the need for compromise and the importance of a strong central government.Other high-value items at the auction included a 1776 draft of the Articles of Confederation sold for $1 million and a 1788 Journal of the Convention of North Carolina fetched $85,000.Auction officials were unsure of the document's value due to the lack of comparable sales. The previous sale of a similar document was in 1891 for $400. In 2021, Sotheby's sold a different copy of the Constitution for $43.2 million, setting a record.Meanwhile, in 2021, Sotheby's in New York auctioned one of the 14 surviving original copies of the Constitution, printed for the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention delegates, for $43.2 million, setting a new record for the sale of a book or document.","Rare 237-year-old copy of the US Constitution was sold for $9 million at an auction in North Carolina on Thursday.
