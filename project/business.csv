Maharashtra language row: Deputy CM Eknath Shinde hits back at Shiv Sena (UBT); calls opposition ‘double-faced’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-language-row-deputy-cm-eknath-shinde-hits-back-at-shiv-sena-ubt-calls-opposition-double-faced/articleshow/122138171.cms,"File photo: Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Amid a growing political uproar over the Maharashtra government’s move to introduce Hindi in schools, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday lashed out at the Shiv Sena (UBT), accusing it of playing “double-faced” politics and misrepresenting facts around the three-language formula.Responding to Uddhav Thackeray ’s faction’s demand for the resignation of school education minister Dada Bhuse, Shinde was quoted as saying by news agency ANI, “The then chief minister of Maharashtra had made mandatory the teaching of three languages – Marathi, English, and Hindi – based on the recommendations of the Raghunath Mashelkar Committee. When they were in power, they had a different opinion. Now that they are not, their stand has completely changed. The people who practise double-faced politics have no right to demand Dada Bhuse’s resignation.”This comes after Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray accused the BJP-led state government of forcing Hindi upon students and demanded that no language should be imposed. “Focus on what children are already studying. Restructure it and make it better. But don’t burden students further,” he said.NCP supremo Sharad Pawar also opposed the move, stating that while Hindi is widely spoken, it should not be forced at the primary level.“Let them learn Hindi after Class 5. But imposing it too early burdens children and sidelines their mother tongue,” he told reporters, urging the state to withdraw its insistence.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut blamed the central government, claiming that the decision was part of the new education policy promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. “This wasn’t the Maharashtra government’s decision. It was imposed by the Centre. The new education policy has been opposed by many states,” Raut alleged, as quoted by ANI.Meanwhile, deputy CM Ajit Pawar clarified that the cabinet would soon discuss the matter. “We’ve never supported forcing Hindi from the beginning. Let it be taught from Class 5, not earlier,” he said, according to news agency PTI.The controversy was triggered after an April 16 government resolution made Hindi mandatory as a third language in Marathi- and English-medium schools. Following backlash, the rule was amended to say Hindi would be the third language “in general,” with students allowed to opt for alternatives if at least 20 of them chose so.CM Devendra Fadnavis has also defended the policy, asserting that Marathi remains compulsory, while Hindi and English follow the Mashelkar committee recommendations accepted by the previous Uddhav Thackeray government. He said, “Marathi is compulsory. Hindi is optional. Students can choose any Indian language.”The issue is likely to be discussed during the upcoming monsoon session of the state legislature, with opposition parties planning joint protests against what they call the “imposition” of Hindi.",Eknath Shinde accuses Shiv Sena (UBT) of playing 'double-faced' politics.

India's time in space: Axiom-4 lifts off; how Dragon will put Shubhanshu Shukla inside ISS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-time-in-space-axiom-4-finally-takes-off-shubhanshu-shukla-becomes-first-indian-to-cross-karman-line/articleshow/122078919.cms,"Poll What do you think is the most exciting aspect of Shubhanshu Shukla's mission? First Indian to reach the ISS Boosts India's space journey toward 2035 goals

As night enveloped Cape Canaveral, India entered a new dawn when the Falcon-9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2.31 am ET (12.01n pm IST). In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space, ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme,"" reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph.

The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate.

Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over.

In India, health insurance is generally often an afterthought, something you purchase for tax benefits, or workplace compliance. And many of us assume that having a policy means being protected. Sure, there’s protection, but is it enough?Imagine this scenario: a family member is hospitalised, and there’s a comforting thought:But as bills arrive, comfort gives way to confusion. There are deductions for choosing a certain room, charges for procedures that aren’t included, and diagnostic costs that must be paid out of pocket. Suddenly, what looked like full protection feels anything but that.This isn’t just one person’s story, it’s increasingly common. And it raises a critical question: is your health insurance truly designed for the way healthcare works today?Healthcare has evolved dramatically over the last decade. There are more treatment options, earlier interventions, and a broader focus on prevention and recovery. With that has come a rise in costs, even for everyday care.Yet not all insurance plans have kept pace. While many policies offer a dependable foundation, some still have limitations that can leave policyholders exposed.Let’s take a closer look at what this means in real life.Imagine your policy has a room rent cap of ₹4,000. You’re admitted to a hospital and opt for a private room that exceeds the cap by ₹1,000 a day. Because of this, your entire claim; doctor’s fees, medicines, procedures, and tests; is reimbursed at only 80-90% on the claim.That one small upgrade leads to proportionally lower payouts across your bill. Plus, non-medical items like admission kits and registration fees aren’t covered; leaving you to cover the gap out of your pocket.These are part of your everyday healthcare journey. Having a policy that covers it all is crucial.Out-of-pocket healthcare spending in India continues to be high. Even with insurance, individuals often bear a significant share of healthcare costs.As health needs become more complex, insurance cover should reflect that shift. A good comprehensive health plan is structured around how people actually seek and receive care across hospitals, clinics and homes.Take, for example, a couple planning a family. A comprehensive plan would ensure maternity benefits are accessible, newborn care is covered from day one, and even vaccinations are included in the first year.Similarly, someone undergoing surgery should have access to pre-operative diagnostics, a second opinion if needed, and rehabilitation support post-discharge.A coverage that supports the entire spectrum, from pre-hospitalisation to post-recovery, secures both health and finances. A thoughtfully designed health policy not only responds to illness but anticipates life’s medical milestones. These features are what define meaningful coverage:Covering medical expenses before admission and after discharge helps manage the full treatment arc.Especially valuable for critical illnesses, this provides clarity and confidence before proceeding further.If the full coverage amount is used, it’s automatically restored for future use in the same year.Often overlooked, certain policies offer support for acute dental or eye-related treatments.Good comprehensive plans cover both the recipient’s treatment and the donor’s hospitalisation, including complications.Some plans offer home care; useful for post-surgery recovery, chronic illnesses or conditions that require clinical supervision without hospitalisation.For couples facing fertility challenges, some plans offer financial support for assisted reproductive procedures, helping make parenthood more accessible.Covers delivery expenses (normal or caesarean), congenital conditions, and early vaccinations for your baby.If recommended for obesity-related health issues like diabetes or cardiac risks, this is included after a waiting period.Some health plans now reward healthy habits with wellness points that are redeemable for renewal discounts.Select plans also include free expert teleconsultations and AI-based face scan to track vitals making preventive care digital-first and accessible.Regular check-ups are often included as part of the cover, encouraging preventive care and early detection of potential health issues.If you’re unsure whether your plan is truly comprehensive, use this checklist.It’s easy to treat health insurance as a box to tick. But when life takes a turn what matters is whether your cover holds up. Taking the time to reassess your plan is not only prudent, but essential. The right cover is the one that stands by you through the full spectrum of health: hospital, home, recovery, and beyond.That’s why it helps to go with an insurer that has seen it all. With over 19 years of experience and 1 crore+ claims settled, STAR Health has shaped its policies around the realities people face every day.Because in healthcare, the true cost is not what you pay for a policy; It’s what you pay when your policy falls short.","Maternity care often comes with a long waiting period or may not be included at all. dental and ophthalmic treatments are typically excluded, even though they’re common medical needs.

During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: Disregarding opposition parties' protests against its move to conduct a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar - requiring submission of citizenship proof by electors enrolled after 2003 - Election Commission has started the exercise in the state's 243 constituencies, with 98,450 booth level officers set to conduct door-to-door verification over the next one month.EC will treat the state's 2003 electoral roll - which has listed 4.9 crore electors - as probative evidence of eligibility, including pres-umption of Indian citizenship unless it receives any input otherwise.Also read: Bihar drive: EC to refer illegals for action under Citizenship Act Any person whose name is not recorded in the 2003 roll will be required to submit from among a set of 11 eligible government documents to establish his/her eligibility as an elector.

'India appears truly grand from space': Shubhanshu Shukla tells PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-appears-truly-grand-from-space-shubhanshu-shukla-tells-pm-modi/articleshow/122133500.cms,"LIVE: Shubhanshu Shukla speaks with PM Modi from the International Space Station

“From space, one cannot see borders—there are no visible boundaries between nations. What stood out most was the sheer unity of the planet,” Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video interaction from the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday.“When we look at maps, we compare the sizes of countries, including India, and often see a distorted picture because we’re flattening a three-dimensional world onto paper,” he said. “But from space, India appears truly grand—majestic in scale and spirit.”Shukla, the first Indian to reach the ISS, said this overwhelming sense of oneness aligns perfectly with India’s civilisational motto of unity in diversity.“From above, Earth looks like a single home shared by all, reminding humanity of the harmony and connection we inherently share.” PM Modi congratulated him for “hoisting the flag of India in space” and said: “Although you are the farthest from the Indian motherland, you are the closest to the hearts of all Indians.”He added, “Today I can say with confidence that this is the first chapter of success of India’s Gaganyaan mission . Your historic journey is not just limited to space—it will give speed and new vigour to our journey of Viksit Bharat.”Calling science and spirituality the twin strengths of India, the PM said, “With the success of the Chandrayaan mission, there is renewed interest in science among children and youth.Now your historic journey is giving more power to this resolve.”In response, Shukla said, “This is not just my personal journey—it reflects the direction in which India is advancing. Under your leadership, today’s India enables the realisation of dreams that once seemed impossible.”He spoke of the challenges in adapting to microgravity. “Even the smallest tasks are complex. I’ve strapped my feet down just to stay in place during this conversation!” he said, adding that one could sleep on the wall, ceiling or “even on the forehead” since orientation is fluid in orbit.When asked whether meditation and mindfulness had helped, Shukla agreed: “As you rightly said, science and spirituality are both our nation’s strength. The calmer you are, the better your decisions. One cannot eat while running. In space, inner calm is crucial.”The astronaut also shared details of the scientific experiments he’s carrying out. “For the first time, Indian scientists have designed seven unique experiments for the space station,” he said. One experiment uses stem cells to study muscle loss in microgravity and could help the elderly on Earth. Another focuses on cultivating highly nutritious microalgae to support food security. “Processes occur faster in space, which accelerates research,” Shukla said.PM Modi praised these efforts and said Shukla’s journey would inspire young Indians. “Today’s children don’t just look at the sky—they believe they can reach it. This mindset is the foundation of India’s future missions.”The Prime Minister added that “India must move forward with Mission Gaganyaan, build its own space station, and achieve the landing of an Indian astronaut on the Moon.” He also expressed confidence that Shukla was “diligently recording his observations and learnings”.Shukla confirmed that he had been absorbing every detail “like a sponge” and said his international colleagues had expressed interest in being part of Gaganyaan. “I told them, ‘Very soon,’” he said, promising to apply his learnings fully to accelerate India’s upcoming missions.He closed by addressing India’s youth: “There’s no one path to success, but if you never stop trying, it will come—sooner or later.”PM Modi concluded: “India is opening new frontiers in space for the world… The sky is no longer the limit.”","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is the first Indian to reach the ISS.

IIT-Kanpur to conduct trials for artificial rain

Delhi govt is likely to conduct a cloud seeding pilot project between July 4 and 11, when weather is expected to be feasible for causing artificial rain, city environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said. He added that govt had received a report from IMD, which has been shared with DGCA along with a flight map for getting permission for the project.The govt has chalked out a tentative flight plan for the experiment, which includes Bawana, Rohini, Alipur, Kundli and Burari. The minister said IMD's reports and the flight map were approved in coordination with IIT Kanpur.The Delhi cabinet had on May 7 okayed a proposal to conduct five cloud-seeding trials, with a project outlay of Rs 3.21 crore. The trials were to be carried out in May-end and early June in collaboration with IIT Kanpur.""The met department told us that till July 3 conditions are not feasible for cloud seeding; however, the July 4-11 window is favourable. DGCA has sought a backup time window in case cloud-seeding turns unfeasible during July 4-11 due to weather changes,"" Sirsa said.""We believe that by Monday we'll see progress in getting approvals from DGCA,"" the minister said.Cloud seeding is a weather-modification technique that introduces chemicals into the air to aggregate and condense moisture particles into rain. In this technique, compounds such as silver iodide (AgI) are released into the atmosphere to aid the formation of ice crystals that lead to rain.Soon after the formation of the BJP-led govt in Delhi, Sirsa announced that they would seek no-objection certificates from agencies concerned for conducting artificial rain in the winter season, when the capital records high pollution levels. Later, on June 18, the minister said govt had received all clearances barring that from the DGCA. For cloud seeding, clearances are needed from the Special Protection Group (SPG), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Union ministries of environment, defence and home, UP govt, IMD as well as DGCA, Airport Authority of India and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.Trials for artificial rain will be executed by IIT Kanpur, which had earlier conducted the experiment using its own modified aircraft equipped with a mist sprinkler aiming to cover a minimum of 100sq km per sortie. The minister had earlier said IIT Kanpur's aircraft has the necessary permit from DGCA and can remain in the air for around five hours. Scientists from IIT Kanpur expect the sortie to take at least one hour and 30 minutes. The minister had also stated that after the trial, water samples will be collected to conduct a study to ensure see if there are harmful chemicals in it.He added that as per global studies and an earlier trial run by IIT Kanpur, the success rate is around 60-70%. As per IIT Kanpur, nimbostratus clouds are the most suitable type for seeding experiments. These are usually at heights of 500-6,000 meters above ground level.The previous AAP govt had repeatedly proposed conducting artificial rain during winters but shelved it citing unfavourable meteorological conditions. During the winter of 2024, the AAP govt had floated the plan again but later alleged that it was not getting enough support or backing from the Centre.",The Delhi cabinet had on May 7 okayed a proposal to conduct five cloud-seeding trials.

On the other hand, India aligns with the global pattern for men, with around 3% of working-age men (15–64 years) being entrepreneurs, which is in line with expectations given its income levels.The research draws upon data from the World Bank covering 186 countries in 2022 and points out that India is one of the most significant outliers in terms of low female entrepreneurship, given its stage of economic development.Using nationally representative data, the research paper, presented at NCAER's India Policy Forum on Friday, showed that female labour force participation explained much of the gender gap in self-employment, but not in entrepreneurship, where women remain under-represented. It found large, persistent barriers to firm growth for women, even in richer states—highlighting the need for multidimensional, state-specific policy solutions.Among various data sources, the authors, Gaurav Chiplunkar from University of Virginia and Pinelopi K. Goldberg from Yale University, drew upon data on working-age population -- (21-65 years) in the 2023 round of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). “Overall, 64% of individuals participate in labour but this masks differences across gender: 91% of men participate in labour as compared to only 39% of women, implying that for every 10 men there are only 4.2 women in the labour force,” the paper stated.Furthermore, 35% of men and 12% of women operate own-account enterprises, which makes them self-employed individuals without hired labour.","Less than 1% of Indian women are entrepreneurs, placing India far below the global trendline.

Cheering the astronaut, Modi told him that “you may be far from us but the hearts of 140 crore Indians beat with you”.“The first thing I saw was Earth — it looks perfectly unified. No borders are visible. India looks so large from here, far more prominent than on a map. From up here, there are no countries, no divisions — just one home. That is our ethos: unity in diversity. Just a while ago, when I saw from the window of ISS, I could see Hawaii,” Group Captain Shukla told the PM while informing him, “I have hoisted the tricolour on ISS. India has reached ISS. ”Also read: 'Furthest from motherland but closest to Indian hearts': PM Modi interacts with Shubhanshu Shukla in ISS - watch video Modi said Shukla’s name carries the word ‘shubh’ (meaning auspicious) and that his journey marked the auspicious “beginning of a new era”. The Indian astronaut told the PM that his space sojourn was “not my journey alone but also our country’s”.“We trained for a year and I learnt about different systems...but after coming here, everything changed...Here, even small things are different because there is no gravity in space...Sleepinghere is a big challenge...I can even sleep on the roof. It takes some time to get used to this environment,” Shukla told the PM, while adding, “Right now, we are travelling at a speed of 28,000 kmph and I am talking to you with my legs tied. ” “This speed reflects how fast our nation is progressing and now, we must go even beyond this,” he said.The astronaut said the space station orbits Earth 16 times a day and that he is privileged to witness 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets every day.Also read: Nostalgia hits hard: 41 years after Rakesh Sharma's 'saare jahan se acha', Shubhanshu Shukla calls India 'majestic' from space While referring the astronaut as “Shux”, PM gave him “homework”, telling him to learn as much as possible because the lessons learnt from this Axiom-4 mission “will have to be extensively used in the Gaganyaan mission , our own Bharatiya Antariksh Station and also for landing an Indian on the Moon.” Shukla told Modi that he is “absorbing experiences at ISS like a sponge”.When the PM asked about Indian delicacies he carried to space and whether he shared them with his space mates, Shukla said he is carrying “gajar ka halwa, moong dal halwa, and aamras into orbit”. “I wanted my fellow crew members from other countries to taste India’s heritage. We all sat together and enjoyed it. They loved it,” Shukla said.Shukla shared his reflections from space — on science, struggle, and the boundless dreams of a rising nation. The call was more than ceremonial. It was a glimpse into how India’s spacefaring ambitions have matured. Modi described Shukla’s journey not as a solitary voyage but as India’s own orbit of progress. “When I was a child, I never imagined I could become an astronaut. But today, modern India enables the realisation of such dreams,” Shukla said.Also read: India's time in space: Axiom-4 lifts off; how Dragon will put Shubhanshu Shukla inside ISS When asked by Modi about microgravity tests he will carry out on ISS, especially from the medicine and agriculture sectors, Shukla said, he “will do seven experiments”. “Today, I am going to do a test on stem cells. I am doing a test on supplements to see if such supplements can help prevent muscle loss. This will help people in old age who are losing muscle due to ageing,” he said. Another test explores the cultivation of nutrient-rich microalgae, which could boost food security back home. “The advantage of space,” he said, “is that processes happen quickly. That accelerates research and inspires children back home to say, ‘I can go there too’.”PM Modi asked what message he would send to India’s youth.

We’ll build our own space station. We’ll land Indian astronauts on the Moon. And, I’m documenting everything—every lesson I learn will help others fly sooner.”His final words struck a chord destined to echo across classrooms, command centres and quiet corners of the country: “The sky is never the limit—not for me, not for you, and not for India.”‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ chant filled up the space station as the PM raised the slogan towards the end of the 18-minute conversation, which was reciprocated by Shukla.","Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla has his first interaction with the PM through a video link from the International Space Station. “The first thing I saw was Earth — it looks perfectly unified.

He was addressing the centenary celebrations of Jain saint Acharya Vidyanand Maharaj at Vigyan Bhawan on Saturday. ""We are promoting mother tongues in higher education. And that is why I said from the Red Fort that we must free the country from the mentality of colonialism. We must move forward with development and heritage together,"" he said countering opposition from some states to the Centre's three-language formula and accusation of Hindi imposition.Modi highlighted the govt's recent recognition of Prakrit as a classical language in Oct 2024, alongside efforts to digitise ancient Jain scriptures and promote mother tongues in higher education.On the occasion, the PM was conferred with the title of 'Dharma Chakravarti', to which he said, ""I do not consider myself worthy of it, but our tradition teaches us to accept what is given by saints as prasad. Therefore, I humbly accept this prasad of yours and dedicate it at the feet of Mother India."" he also referred to the preceding speech of a Jain seer, noting that he was blessing "" Operation Sindoor "".PM's mere mention of ""Jo humein chhedega (those who trouble us)"" brought massive cheers from the audience, but he did not dwell any further on the issue.

""This thought is connected to the essence of Jain philosophy and India's consciousness. India prioritises service (and) humanity.

Bihar drive: EC to refer illegals for action under Citizenship Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-drive-ec-to-refer-illegals-for-action-under-citizenship-act/articleshow/122135677.cms,"NEW DELHI: Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) will henceforth not only decide on inclusions or deletions to be made in the electoral roll during the special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar and eventually across country, but also refer cases of suspected foreign nationals included in the rolls or applying for fresh registration, to the competent authority under Citizenship Act, for further action.In case the ERO or the Assistant ERO (AERO) doubts the eligibility of the proposed elector due to non-submission of requisite documents or otherwise, he will start a suo motu inquiry and issue notice to the elector. Based on field inquiry, documentation or otherwise, ERO/AERO shall decide on inclusion of the elector in the final rolls, and pass a ‘speaking’ order in each such case.No entry from the draft roll shall be deleted without conducting an inquiry and giving a fair opportunity to the person affected, to be heard. If the person excluded from the roll is still aggrieved, he may appeal to the DM and, subsequently, file a second and final appeal before the chief electoral officer (CEO).Cases of suspected foreign nationals referred to the competent authority under Citizenship Act, 1955 may be followed by more exhaustive inquiry at the level of district collector or police.If the suspicion is confirmed, the procedure requires such “illegal immigrant” to be “confined” to a transit facility or detention centre in the state/UT of his residence, pending deportation to his country of origin.SIR guidelines issued by EC on Tuesday have laid stress on transparency at every stage of the roll revision process. For instance, the enumeration form to be filled up by all existing electors who were included in the rolls after 2003 and the new/shifted applicants, will be uploaded on ECINET along with documentary proof submitted to establish their citizenship status.“Technology enables uploading of such documentary proof by each voter on ECINET, though these can only be accessed by authorised EC officers. This will not only create a trail of legacy documents for posterity, but also take care of any subsequent legal challenges,” said an EC official. The official said unlike the old system where the eligibility conditions to enroll as an elector were simply verified by the ERO to his satisfaction “it is now necessary that the documents on the basis of which such satisfaction of ERO is arrived at, are also uploaded in ECINET”.To guard against political parties’ constant doubts regarding roll updation, EC has now decided that not only the draft roll, but also the list of claims and objections and final roll shall be uploaded on the state/UT CEO’s website and shared with all recognised parties. Booth level agents appointed by parties will be involved in every stage of the revision process, as before.ERO will share a list of claims and objections with them on a weekly basis. In fact, photos of draft and final roll being handed over to parties, as also supply of the weekly list of claims and objections, will be made public.","Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) will henceforth decide on inclusions or deletions to be made in the electoral roll.

Engineers in governance can shape India’s future: IIT-M director Kamakoti,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-madras-eyes-global-top-50-with-major-expansion-plans/articleshow/122122083.cms,"IIT Madras

has launched the Pragati platform to support students aspiring for the civil services. And how do you see it shaping aspirations beyond tech and corporate careers?

What’s the story behind your ‘One Patent a Day’ initiative? Has it achieved what you set out to do?

You’ve set a goal of incubating 100 startups annually. What structures support this push?

Can you share your vision for the planned sustainability-focused campus in Puducherry?

What’s the thinking behind IIT-Madras setting up international research centres in places like Dubai?

Any final thoughts on what drives this long list of initiatives?

NEW DELHI: As India eyes ambitious developmental goals by 2047, IIT-Madras is redefining its role well beyond the confines of traditional engineering education. From nurturing civil services aspirants through the newly formalised Pragati platform to filing more than one patent a day, incubating over 100 startups annually, and developing a sustainability-focused campus in Puducherry, the institute is expanding its frontiers. In a strategic shift, IIT-Madras is also exploring the establishment of its own medical college — a key step it sees as essential to breaking into the world’s top 50 universities. In this exclusive interview director Professor V Kamakoti lays out the institute’s broad vision, including its international research centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany, and why technocrats must help shape India’s governance and innovation ecosystem to Manash Pratim Gohain.Professor V Kamakoti: Governance today is inseparable from technology. Look at national missions like Quantum, Cyber-Physical Systems, or Jal Jeevan—every one of them is tech-heavy. Engineers in civil services can help conceive and deliver policies that are interdisciplinary and effective.The idea began with a conversation with an alumnus who became Tamil Nadu’s DGP and came back for a PhD while in service. We held a weekend session and simply circulated a Google form.To our surprise, 350 students showed up—including BTechs, MTechs, and PhDs. The hall couldn’t hold them all. That’s when we knew it needed formal structure.Through Pragati, we’ve institutionalised study groups, peer learning, and mentoring. We’re also aligning electives in social sciences and general studies with civil services needs. The idea is to get talented technocrats into public service early—when they’re full of energy—and let them grow into leadership roles over decades.Kamakoti: Absolutely. This was about creating a culture of invention. With 600+ faculty and 12,000 students, even if a few percent file IPs annually, we’re already ahead. In 2023-24, we filed 417 intellectual property claims — averaging 1.2 a day.It’s also about confidence. We tell students: your ideas are valuable. Many of our major donors — over Rs 300 crore in commitments last year — are alumni entrepreneurs, not employees. They created wealth through innovation. It’s proof that patenting can lead to entrepreneurship and long-term prosperity.Kamakoti: We’ve built a full stack: from the Entrepreneurship Cell and C5, to the Nirman pre-incubator, and then on to our Research Park incubation ecosystem, which includes verticals like health tech, fintech, and rural innovation.We’ve introduced system-level thinking courses for BTech students from their second year onward. Postgraduates come with research ideas, and we help them convert those into startups. Last year, we incubated 103 startups, many of them deep-tech, like Agnikul, which is building launch vehicles for satellites, and Agnirath, our solar-powered racing car team competing in Australia.These aren’t small-time ventures — they are solving global, high-impact challenges.Kamakoti: Sustainability is now a key metric in global rankings, and more importantly, it’s essential for planetary survival. We've launched the School of Sustainability under our School of Interdisciplinary Studies.The new campus in Puducherry will be entirely focused on research aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are collaborating with Auroville and other local partners. Research there will focus on green construction, zero-emission technologies, renewable energy, and more. Every aspect of the campus will itself be a sustainability model.This is our contribution to “One Earth, One Family, One Future” — a vision also highlighted by our Prime Minister during the G20 summit.Kamakoti: Global expansion is necessary if we want Indian institutions to break into the world’s top 50. The top-ranked universities all have global campuses, deep research collaborations, and — critically — medical schools. We are actively working in that direction.As I’ve said If you really want to come to the top 50 (in global rankings), you must have a medical school. That’s the hard truth. So yes, we’re studying how to eventually integrate a medical school into our institution. This would be closely linked with engineering and science, enabling translational research, biotech innovations, and advanced healthcare solutions.Our international expansion under IITM Global is another pillar of this effort. After launching the Zanzibar campus, we’re now planning research centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany. These won’t just be teaching outposts — they will drive local problem-solving and joint innovation. We’re laying the groundwork for IIT-Madras to become a truly global institution.Kamakoti: Simple — India is at a unique inflection point. We have the brains, the demographics, and now, the infrastructure. Our role as an institution is to empower, enable, and energise. Whether it’s a civil servant, an inventor, a founder, or a sustainability scientist, we want every student to leave here with the conviction: I can build something that matters.","IIT-Madras has launched the Pragati platform to support students aspiring for the civil services. In 2023-24, we filed 417 intellectual property claims — averaging 1.2 a day.

What is Indus Waters Treaty?

NEW DELHI: India on Friday dismissed the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal, firmly rejecting its authority.The ministry of external affairs snubbed the “supplemental award” by the ""illegal"" Court of Arbitration for asserting its authority to hear the Kishenganga and Ratle hydropower cases in Jammu and Kashmir.The ministry also highlighted that the court was constituted in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.Supplemental award issued by the Court of Arbitration refers to a follow-up decision specifically on whether the tribunal has the legal authority (competence) to hear the case about India’s Kishenganga and Ratle projects, not on the projects themselves, but on the court’s jurisdiction.""India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,"" the MEA said in its statement .After the Pakistan-backed terrorist attack in Pahalgam, the government placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.In a strong statement, the foreign ministry said the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" ceases its support for cross-border terrorism.""Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under it,"" the statement said.""India, therefore, categorically rejects this so-called supplemental award as it has rejected all prior pronouncements of this body,"" the issue read.Calling the move a ""charade at Pakistan’s behest"", the government called the ""supplemental award"" another desperate attempt by Islamabad to escape accountability for its role as the global epicentre of terrorism.""Pakistan's resort to this fabricated arbitration mechanism is consistent with its decades-long pattern of deception and manipulation of international forums,"" the ministry added.This year in January, a neutral expert upheld India's stand after seven questions were raised in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects on matters related to the Indus water treaty.""India welcomes the decision given by the neutral expert under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F to the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960. The decision upholds and vindicates India’s stand that all seven (07) questions that were referred to the Neutral Expert, in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, are differences falling within his competence under the Treaty,"" MEA said after the decision.""It has been India’s consistent and principled position that the Neutral Expert alone has the competence under the treaty to decide these differences. Having upheld his own competence, which comports with India’s view, the neutral expert will now proceed to the next (merits) phase of his proceeding. This phase will culminate in a final decision on the merits of each of the seven differences,"" it added.In 2017, the World Bank, which is the facilitator of the treaty, had said that India was allowed to construct hydroelectric power facilities on tributaries of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers with certain restrictions under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).IWT was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus Basin. Under the treaty, the total waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - was allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - was allocated largely to Pakistan.India is, however, permitted to use the water of western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power. But India has not been fully utilising its legal share due to lack of storage capacity.Though India has right to create water storage capacity up to 3.6 million acre-feet on western rivers as per IWT, not enough storage capacity has been created. Besides, out of estimated power potential of 20,000 MW, which can be harnessed from power projects on western rivers, only 3,482 MW capacity has been constructed.","India rejects the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal.

MUMBAI: Uddhav and Raj Thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties here on July 5 against what they allege is the imposition of Hindi in Maharashtra's schools from Class 1 through the new three-language policy.This will be the first time that the two will come together on a political platform after Raj's decision to quit Shiv Sena to form MNS nearly two decades ago.There has been speculation of a possible reunion of the estranged cousins for the coming civic polls; the protest march is being seen as the first step in that direction.Initially, Uddhav and Raj had on Thursday announced two separate marches: on July 6 and 7 respectively.According to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut, Raj dialled him Friday and said it would not be good to hold two marches for the Marathi language in this way and a joint movement could have a big impact. Raut said he then spoke to Uddhav, who agreed ""without hesitation."" The march will mostly be from Girgaum Chowpatty to Azad Maidan. Both parties have said it will be non-political and no party flags will be displayed.MNS functionary Sandeep Deshpande and Sena (UBT) MLA Varun Sardesai also met on Friday at a restaurant in Dadar (W), further fuelling speculation that the parties would come together not just for the protest but for the BMC polls too.Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray also met Deshpande at an event on Friday, where they greeted each other; Deshpande has fought the 2024 assembly polls against Aaditya from Worli and lost.Marathi language expert Deepak Pawar, who had called for a protest on July 7, said Marathi language activists will join the July 5 protest and continue protests on July 7 if govt doesn't roll back its three-language policy. The opposition and several groups have criticized the state govt, alleging it is trying to impose Hindi as the third language, though the govt has said Hindi is not mandatory.After issuing a GR on June 17 on the third-language policy, the govt took two steps back this week, first by saying it would have wide-ranging consultations before finalizing the policy and second by saying the third language would be taught via the play-way method, only orally, in Class 1 and 2, with no textbooks for students and no tests or exams.Raut said Raj initially told him he had no idea about the UBT Sena's march.When he discussed Raj's message of having one march with Uddhav Thackeray , Raut said that ""he said he too was not in favour of a separate march but as July 6 is Ashadhi Ekadashi, it would be difficult to reach the people. I conveyed this to Raj Thackeray. After talking to Uddhav Thackeray, we suggested July 5 as the date. Raj Thackeray agreed to it after talking to his colleagues... This march will be without any political agenda. Through it, govt will see the strength of the Marathi people.""Education minister Dada Bhuse had met Raj on Thursday to explain the govt's stand, but Raj had said the govt's view wasn't acceptable. Deshpande said, ""Raj Thackeray took the initiative and called Sanjay Raut and the date of the march was decided. We are inviting all parties, including Marathi-loving office-bearers of BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena.""It's a good thing the Thackerays are keeping aside political differences and coming together as Marathi manoos. They will decide if they will come together politically. For now, we are focusing on the march.""The protest will change the political direction of Maharashtra. The protest is not Raj or Uddhav Thackeray's, it belongs to the Marathi manoos.""Sardesai said there was dialogue between Sena (UBT) and MNS. ""We are asking everyone to join the protest, so we met to plan the march,"" he said.MNS functionaries said they were reaching out to Congress, NCP and NCP (SP) netas along with other parties and organisations to invite them for the march.",Uddhav and Raj Thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties on July 5.

The cause for the illness is under probe.Sources said Friday's incident occurred on flight ET640, when the aircraft (ET-AXS) was overflying the Arabian Sea. It was cruising at 33,000 feet when the cabin depressurisation took place and the pilots executed a rapid descent to a lower altitude, according to data from Flightradar24.For human survival, aircraft cabins are sealed and pressurised with conditioned air and oxygen. This allows aircraft to fly at higher altitudes where oxygen levels are low.However, on rare occasions, the pressurisation system can fail. The pressure and oxygen level in the cabin will then drop, and oxygen masks deploy from the overhead panel.","Mumbai-bound Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa made an emergency landing in the city at 1.42am on Friday.

Microsoft sued by authors for allegedly using pirated books to train AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-sued-by-authors-for-allegedly-using-pirated-books-to-train-ai-model/articleshow/122088854.cms,"Authors accuse Microsoft of copyright infringement

Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.","Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction against Microsoft.

A spiritual path grounded in scientific wisdom



Gauranga Das’s unique approach to leadership



Books that bridge the gap between worlds



The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today. The curriculum combines ancient insights with modern administrative frameworks, helping students navigate complexity, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas in real-world governance and social impact roles.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das met at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The pair discussed the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.

What if the tight end job were the NFL's new gold mine? In the past decade, it's exactly what it has become. They transitioned from a blocking-centric position to a top source of highlight-reel plays as well as seven-figure paydays. Modern tight ends don't just catch passes; they catch dollars in the form of record-smashing contracts, endorsement deals, podcasts, and shrewd side hustles.Headed up the charge? Here is the group of five elite TEs who’ve turned gridiron greatness into serious financial success.When you think of tight ends and money, you think of Travis Kelce. The Kansas City Chiefs’ superstar has transformed into one of the league’s wealthiest tight ends, with an estimated net worth of $50–60 million. His on-field dominance (multiple Super Bowls, consistent 1,000-yard seasons) is just the baseline.In April of 2024, he solidified that status with a two-year, $34.25 million extension, the type of deal that places him at the top or second on the payday lists. Off the field, Kelce's brand has blown up with endorsements from Nike, Bud Light, State Farm, and McDonald's. His New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce is said to be a multi-million-dollar media powerhouse.And even a Kellogg's-style cereal line contributes to his entrepreneurial spirit.Rob Gronkowski may have retired from the limelight, but his bank account is one of the stories of dominance. With four Super Bowl rings (two with New England, one with Tampa Bay), he’s not just legendary on paper; he’s legendary in paychecks.Gronkowski’s savvy investments and off-the-grid corporate roles have pushed his net worth to around $45–50 million. He capitalized on his charm with media gigs and endorsement deals that extended well beyond football.The people who've seen George Kittle realize he is not only dominating on the field but dominating in negotiations as well. The incandescent San Francisco 49ers tight end negotiated a four-year, $76.4 million contract in 2024. And that ranks among the highest-paid players at his position at an average of $19.1 million annually.His net worth of $30–40 million is indicative of the contributions he makes as a blocker as well as a thunderous pass receiver. Kittle's on-field personality, cute-as-a-button tough and boundless energy, has carried over nicely to brand contracts and sponsorships that tap into his ""teddy bear confronts tank"" charm.The toughness and reliability of Jason Witten served him well in establishing a career and an estimated net worth of approximately $25–35 million. A 16-year fixture with the Dallas Cowboys, Witten was frequently the emotional and professional leader of the team. Eleven Pro Bowl appearances and consistent solidity made him extremely valuable, and he leveraged that longevity for large contracts.After retirement, he transitioned smoothly to broadcasting with ESPN's Monday Night Football, then briefly un-retired to suit up with the Cowboys and Raiders. Between media earnings and savvy business deals, Witten's extended career in football circles has paid off in both literal and real ways.Jimmy Graham may have retired his cleats in March 2024, but not before establishing a net worth estimated at $20–25 million. Specializing in deep-red zone aerial supremacy and Pro Bowl showings, Graham always demanded hefty paydays with several clubs, including the Saints, Seahawks, Packers, and Bears.He wisely managed his salary and has held on to his fortune through a mix of conservative investments and staying connected to the world of athletics after retirement. While more subdued than a few of the larger names on this list, Graham's bank deposits and fiscal responsibility have kept him comfortably placed among the richest tight ends.Whereas signed contracts and Pro Bowl selections were the starting points, it's the off-field grind that solidified these tight ends as NFL riches royalty. Multi-million dollar contracts, enduring media franchises, and shrewd investments, these guys now embody how the new-age tight end forges wealth far greater than their contribution on the field.The job remains a work in progress. Star players such as Mark Andrews and T.J. Hockenson are racking up elite stats and new contracts that will find them on next year's ""Top Richest TE"" lists. Until then, however, these five pioneers, Travis Kelce, Rob Gronkowski, George Kittle, Jason Witten, and Jimmy Graham, hold court. In the NFL's new world, tight ends are not merely catching passes; they're catching paychecks.","Travis Kelce, Rob Gronkowski, George Kittle, Jason Witten, Jimmy Graham, and T.J.

What is the Ganga water agreement between India and Bangladesh?

The water-sharing agreement of 1996 between India and Bangladesh was established to resolve disputes regarding the Farakka water allocation.

The discord arose following the 1975 activation of the Farakka barrage, which channelled water from the Ganges to the Hooghly River to ensure the Calcutta port remained navigable.

The agreement established terms between India, the upstream nation, and Bangladesh, the downstream nation, for sharing Ganges water at Farakka - a barrier constructed on river Bhagirathi, approximately 10 kilometres from Bangladesh's border.

The Farakka Barrage's construction facilitated a 40,000 cusecs water diversion into a feeder canal serving the Kolkata Port Trust.

The current protocol allocates 35,000 cusecs of water alternately to both nations for 10-day periods during the lean season from March 11 to May 11.

Pakistan BEGS India To Reverse Decision to Suspend Indus Waters Treaty, Writes Letter to Reconsider

Ganges Water Sharing Treaty with Bangladesh to be revised? India is exploring various alternatives to modify and reassess a significant agreement with Bangladesh regarding the distribution of Ganga waters, following its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan.The agreement for sharing Ganga waters, called the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty, expires in 2026, marking 30 years since its implementation. While renewal requires mutual agreement, New Delhi is eyeing a fresh treaty that addresses its present developmental requirements, sources told ET.The agreement, which was formalised in 1996 when Sheikh Hasina began her first tenure as Bangladesh's Prime Minister, established a framework for distributing Ganga's flow at the Farakka Barrage in West Bengal during the critical dry period from January 1 to May 31 annually.Also Read | China plays hardball!

According to these sources, India seeks to modify the treaty to accommodate its requirements for irrigation, harbour maintenance, and electricity production.The West Bengal administration reportedly supports the Central government's position, considering that the treaty's existing provisions are insufficient for their requirements.Also Read | India bleeds Pakistan dry: Water at ‘dead’ levels in Pakistan's dams; bigger Indus river plans in the works - top points to know","The water-sharing agreement of 1996 between India and Bangladesh was established to resolve disputes regarding the Farakka water allocation.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

“Everything was orderly and convivial.”

“It was an opportunity that allowed me to film my autobiographical movie, The Requiem Boogie, in the house where so many childhood memories in it actually took place. It has been a very special and magical four years. Collectively and in coordination with Mr. Musk and his team, we took the steps we are taking now.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reportedly reclaimed ownership of actor Gene Wilder ’s iconic Bel-Air home after the late star’s nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman , defaulted on a loan he received from the tech billionaire to purchase the property in 2020. Musk initially acquired the single-family Los Angeles home in 2013 for $6.7 million. In 2020, he had expressed intentions to sell the property, stating at the time that he planned to “own no house.” It was later revealed that Musk had lent Walker-Pearlman and his wife, Elizabeth Hunter, $6.7 million to buy the home from him. However, the couple reportedly fell behind on loan payments, prompting Musk to move to foreclose on the property in July 2024.According to a report by Realtor.com, Musk had planned a public auction for the property in December 2024. Yet, January 2025 records indicate the home was ultimately purchased for $7.5 million through an LLC owned by Musk, the report notes.While living in the home, the couple worked toWalker-Pearlman told The Hollywood Reporter.However, the foreclosure sale details and ownership transition were kept private. Walker-Pearlman said,He was reportedly financially affected by the 2023 Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes, which led to delays in loan payments. He previously mentioned to the outlet that there was no ill will between him and Musk regarding the foreclosure notice.In a statement from 2024, Walker-Pearlman said:He and his wife first attempted to sell the house on their own, listing it for $12.95 million in August 2024, but were unable to secure a buyer. The asking price was later reduced to $9.5 million in November 2024.That same month, Walker-Pearlman and Hunter were notified that the property was scheduled for auction in December 2024.

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion).
