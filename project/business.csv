We are also ready to place our manufacturing site in India. The Prime Minister of India and the Government of India have been creating stable conditions and this is because the Indian leadership has been pursuing India comes first policy and we believe that investments in India are profitable,"" the Russian President said.Additionally, Putin discussed the significance of Russia's import substitution programme within the Brics framework, highlighting SME development and the necessity for swift dispute resolution mechanisms for SMEs in Brics+ nations.He also mentioned the success of new Russian brands replacing Western brands, stating achievements in various sectors including consumer goods, IT, high-technology, and agriculture.""For us, it has special relevance as part of the import substitution program, we advent of new Russian brands entering our market, which are replacing the brands by Western partners who have voluntarily left our market.

In 1988, the Soviet Union imported grain for $35 billion, and last year, we exported grain to the tune of $66 billion, and this is largely the merit of our farmers and producers.

From parched earth to green pastures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-parched-earth-to-green-pastures/articleshow/115988556.cms,"Trigger for the project

Public-private partnership

Timing is crucial

In the dust bowl of Khaman Kheda in Madhya Pradesh, Dev Yadav, a local farmer, marvels at his wheat fields. Ever since fresh life was infused into the once-dry local lake in 2022, his crops need three times less water and yields have doubled, which Yadav believes is nothing short of remarkable.“I can now plant two crops of wheat and lentils, even in the drier months,” he says.Just a few kilometres away, in Serwai village, summer used to mean dry waterbodies and plummeting groundwater levels, making livestock rearing nearly impossible.“But so much more is possible now,” says Santosh Patel. “Every family had only about two cows to supply milk for their home consumption. Now that the ‘talaab’ (pond) stays full longer, we can rear more livestock and earn from milk sales,” he added.These stories of prosperity rippling across villages are the humane side of a waterbodies rejuvenation project by ATE Chandra Foundation that manages philanthropic initiatives of the ATE Group, an engineering firm founded in 1939 as part of India’s freedom movement.The foundation, driven by the personal efforts of Archana and Amit Chandra, is focused on improving income and sustainability of small and marginal farmers in India since 2015. While they’ve been partnering with ministries and charities to achieve these and helped conserve 1,500 acres of forests, their standout project has been tackling rural water problems by rejuvenating old waterbodies across India.Since 2016, the foundation has breathed new life into 5,000 lakes, ponds and tanks, spanning 7,000 villages across seven states.The trigger for the project was the epidemic of farmer suicides in Maharashtra. Gayatri Nair Lobo, the foundation’s CEO, recalls how small and marginal farmers, burdened with loans to buy seeds and fertilisers, were pushed to the brink every time monsoons failed.“While loan waivers by the govt only offered temporary relief, we realised we needed a sustainable solution to allow farmers live with dignity, and not on dole-outs,” she says.The foundation knew they had to tackle the problem at its root —dependence on rain. “We explored a few existing solutions and identified one that focused on rejuvenating existing but no longer usable waterbodies,” explains Lobo.Their pilot project, the foundation said, took root at the Akoladev Dam in Maharashtra’s Jalna district, driven by enthused farmers and a demand for nutrient-rich silt that would reduce their need for costly fertilisers.“We figured out that all the lakes and ponds in Maharashtra could hold water three times the capacity of Bhakra Nangal Dam. The demand from farmers and the feedback that we got pushed us to do more,” she further said.However, given the limitations of funding a project solely with the foundation’s resources, they began collaborating with the govt. The public-private partnership allowed them to expand across Maharashtra and initiate pilot projects in other states, including Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, starting in 2022.While the govt bears 30% of the cost to hire necessary machinery, the rest of the cost to rejuvenate a waterbody is covered by local farmers and communities that help remove silt, which, they believe, “creates a strong sense of ownership to maintain the water-bodies in the long run”.With the foundation and the govt joining hands under the ‘Gaalmukt Dharan, Gaalyukt Shivar’ (silt free water res ervoirs and silt applied farms) scheme, farmers such as Dasharath Kalidas Hirve in Bhoom district of Osmanabad are transforming barren stretches into fertile fields.Suresh Survase in Dindegaon is hopeful of a bountiful harvest this year. “Because it will also increase the water holding capacity of our dam and we all will get water for cash crops,” he reasoned.Rejuvenating waterbodies is a multi-step process that the foundation has refined over time. Lobo breaks it down into clear steps. First, dry waterbodies are identified.“We use an app to determine which ones have the potential for groundwater percolation. Next, a local NGO engages with the community to educate farmers about the benefits of silt application and generate demand for the silt.On a predetermined date, machinery such as a backhoe loader or excavator is hired. Farmers line up with their tractors to collect the silt, apply it to their fields, and return for more,” says Lobo, adding that timing is crucial since the work needs to be completed between mid-April and mid-June, when the waterbody is dry.Tapping into local wisdom has been the key, given that many communities have their age-old ways of managing water.“The NGO we select for a district identifies village elders who weigh in, especially on silt quality and application techniques,” Lobo adds. So, how do they prevent future silting?“Our experience shows these waterbodies stay healthy for eight to ten years,” she says, adding that this ensures a higher return on investment. “For a very small cost per litre of water storage, you get a functioning waterbody with all its benefits for almost a decade.”(Know about any such inspiring story?

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges.

NEW DELHI: BJP's Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday met Maharashtra governor C P Radhakrishnan and staked claim to form Mahayuti 2.0 ending days of suspense over government formation in the state after the ruling coalition's landslide victory in the assembly elections. However, there is still no clarity if caretaker chief minister Eknath Shinde will join the government as his deputy.Shinde, who addressed the media after the meeting of Mahayuti leaders with the governor, said ""wait till evening"" when asked about his future role in the government. This was after Fadnavis revealed that Shinde was still undecided on joining the Mahayuti cabinet. Fadnavis maintained that Shinde will play a key role in the government but did not elaborate on what that role would be.""I met Eknath Shinde yesterday and requested him to join the Mahayuti cabinet. All of us, including shiv Sena MLAs, want him to be part of the state cabinet. I am sure he will join the government,"" Fadnavis said after meeting the governor.Shinde, who became the chief minister in 2022 after he rebelled against Uddhav Thackeray and joined hands with the BJP, was keen on a second term after the Mahayuti registered a spectacular victory in the just-concluded assembly elections under his leadership. However, the BJP, which won 132 seats in the 288-member assembly, was clear about leading the government this time. With BJP firm on role reversal, Shinde eventually agreed to leaving the top post for the senior partner.""There is no one too big or small in the Mahayuti. We are working as a team. Two and a half years ago, Fadnavis proposed my name as chief minister. Today, I have proposed Fadnavis's name as the next chief minister,"" Shinde said.Immediately after the results were out, Shiv Sena leaders had orchestrated a campaign for Shinde to continue as Mahayuti's chief minister citing the Bihar model where BJP's junior partner Nitish Kumar is leading the government. Shiv Sena leaders claimed that Mahayuti's spectacular victory was due to Shinde's governance as the chief minister and hence he deserved a second term. Four days after the November 23 mandate, Shinde finally announced that he will abide by the decision of Prime Minister Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on the chief minister pick.","BJP's Devendra Fadnavis met Maharashtra governor C P Radhakrishnan and staked claim to form Mahayuti 2.0.

Changed Mahayuti dynamics? Ajit Pawar's NCP seeks parity with Shinde's Shiv Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/changed-mahayuti-dynamics-ajit-pawars-ncp-seeks-parity-with-shindes-shiv-sena-citing-partys-strike-rate/articleshow/115939740.cms,"Ajit Pawar (left) and Eknath Shinde

NEW DELHI: Has the dynamics within Maharashtra's ruling Mahayuti changed? Ajit Pawar 's NCP , which had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS, after Mahayuti's dismal performance in Lok Sabha elections, seems to have moved closer to the BJP after the assembly elections.With the Shiv Sena playing hardball over the CM's post attributing the spectacular 'Maha' results to Eknath Shinde 's performance as chief minister, Ajit Pawar threw his weight behind Devendra Fadnavis and helped the BJP counter Sena's pressure games.The NCP has openly sought parity with Shiv Sena arguing that their strike rate in assembly elections is better than Shinde Sena and hence they deserve the same number of seats in the new government.""If we look at the strike rate in our alliance, the BJP is number one, followed by Ajit Dada's group in second place and the Shinde group in third place. So, our strike rate is also good and we demand that we get as much representation as they do,"" senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said as the three allies sit together to decide power sharing in Mahayuti 2.0.Bhujbal's claim is contrary to the facts as Shiv Sena's strike rate of 70.4% (57/81) is slightly better than NCP which owns 41 of the 59 seats it contested at a strike rate of 69.5%. The BJP, meanwhile, was way ahead of its allies with a strike rate of 88.5% - winning 132 of the 149 seats it contested.The BJP and the Shiv Sena had come together in 2022 - after Eknath Shinde led a successful revolt against Uddhav Thackeray leading to the fall of the opposition's MVA government. The BJP then gave the CM's post to Shinde and made Fadnavis work as his deputy in a move that surprised everyone.Ajit Pawar joined the NDA government almost a year later after leading a successful revolt against his uncle Sharad Pawar and became the second deputy chief minister of the Mahayuti government. Both Shinde and Pawar eventually got complete control of their parties, including the official names and symbols.However, after the Lok Sabha elections, Ajit Pawar, who could win only one seat, stared at a tense future in Mahayuti while Eknath Shinde consolidated his position as a Hindutva ally of the BJP. The RSS openly attacked the BJP for including NCP in the alliance.The assembly elections marked the reversal of fortunes for Ajit Pawar as he decimated rival Sharad Pawar's faction of NCP and won an impressive 41 seats. When the Shiv Sena, with 57 seats, demanded the chief minister's post again for Eknath Shinde, Ajit Pawar played the spoilsport as he openly backed BJP's Devendra Fadnavis who led the saffron party to a record performance of 132 seats.In the last 10 days, while Eknath Shinde sulked and his Shiv Sena bargained hard, Ajit Pawar, who is sure of deputy CM post again, played his cards well and backed the BJP. One of the Sena leaders admitted that Ajit Pawar's NCP had reduced his party's bargaining power vis-à-vis the BJP.The BJP has given Shinde Sena a long rope despite being only 13 seats short of majority in the 288-member assembly. When it comes to a numbers game, the BJP perhaps could do without either of the two allies.However, the BJP, which made a bold statement in 2022 by making junior partner Shinde the chief minister, may not want to do away with the accrued gains by riding roughshod over its Hindutva ally in the state. By unilaterally announcing December 5 as the oath-ceremony date, the BJP has already given a strong signal that it will be calling the shots in Mahayuti 2.0.","Ajit Pawar's NCP had come under intense attack from several quarters, including the RSS.

Hospitals garner 50% share in healthcare FDI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hospitals-garner-50-share-in-healthcare-fdi/articleshow/115985131.cms,"NEW DELHI: Deal-making in India's healthcare sector has surged in recent years, with hospitals now commanding the largest share of foreign direct investment (FDI) within the sector. In FY24, hospitals accounted for 50% of the FDI in total healthcare, translating to $1.5 billion. This marks a significant increase, as the share of hospitals in healthcare FDI has more than doubled from 24% in FY21, and has been rising from 43% in FY20, underscoring their growing prominence.The trend also reflects a strengthening investor preference for hospitals, alongside the traditionally favoured pharmaceuticals sector.Historically, the pharmaceuticals sector, including APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients), has been the investor favourite, attracting multi-billion-dollar deals. However, post-Covid, the hospital and diagnostics sector has come into the spotlight, drawing a wave of investors and culminating in top-dollar buyouts of major chains such as Manipal and Max. Last week, Aster DM Healthcare announced its decision to merge with Quality Care India.""Hospitals have been at the centre of PE interest over the last few months. The size of the Indian market, relatively underserved markets outside the urban areas, high incidence of disease burden and growth in insurance (both public and private), will continue to fuel growth. Given the demand, there is still a long road for growth. Hence the optimism,'' Sujay Shetty, global health industries advisory leader, PwC India said.One of the major deals last year was Temasek's acquisition of an additional 41% stake in Manipal Hospitals for $2 billion, valuing the company at $4.8 billion.""The country needs investment in quality healthcare and healthcare facilities to reach its goal of a $5 trillion economy. The hospital sector is capital intensive and not really a dividend-paying sector. The sector is reinvesting its profits to create infrastructure, which is demonstrated by the largest capital investment cycle undertaken in the history of our sector, the promise of which is showing up in valuations. At Max alone, we are in the midst of doubling our capacity over the next three years at a cost of over Rs 5,000 crore,"" Abhay Soi, CMD, Max Healthcare stated.Further, hospitals have garnered significant investor attention due to a surge in primary market transactions. With six hospitals completing their IPOs, interest from new investors - primarily private equity seeking ownership - has increased, analysts told TOI.Over FY24-27, plans of the 10 listed Indian hospital firms indicate that their combined bed capacity is set to rise by 47%, with most of the expansion planned in north and south India, Tausif Shaikh, a BNP Paribas analyst said in a recent note.During the four-year period, the listing of seven new large hospital chains on the bourses bolstered the growth, collectively raising around Rs 3,600 crore as primary funding during IPO/QIPS (qualified institutional placements), analysts told TOI.","In FY24, hospitals accounted for 50% of the FDI in total healthcare, translating to $1.5 billion. This marks a significant increase, as the share of hospitals in healthcare FDI has more than doubled from 24% in FY21. Trend also reflects a strengthening investor preference for hospitals, alongside the traditionally favoured pharmaceuticals sector.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115985193,imgsize-18784,width-400,resizemode-4/115985193.jpg"

NCP , which is keen on the finance portfolio for deputy CM Ajit Pawar , is likely to get around 8-10 ministerial berths. Among the likely portfolios are cooperation, agriculture, food and civil supplies, ports, relief and rehabilitation, irrigation, social justice, and women and child development. These are portfolios that have a public interface and are linked to rural voters, the party's main base.Wednesday was the second consecutive day that Fadnavis called on Shinde at Varsha, first to convince him to join the Mahayuti govt as deputy CM and then to finalise a possible power-sharing formula. The meeting lasted for over 30 minutes.A Shiv Sena functionary said that only the chief minister and two deputy CMs are likely to take oath on Thursday evening, and the wider cabinet will be finalised after the govt formation.

So we are still asking for the home portfolio and other key portfolios. Shinde is joining govt, but portfolio allocation will happen after that.

He claimed the ""forcible takeover"" of his shares was part of a plan by former CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Rao stated that soon after the YSRCP tenure began in 2019, the govt appointed PKF & Santhanam for a special audit. It also appointed another Mumbai auditing company for a forensic audit. PKF informed him that they had unearthed irregularities worth Rs 1,000 crore, and the report was submitted to the govt.He stated in the complaint that Vijaysai asked him to talk to Vikranth, who in turn brought the proposal of taking over his shares in KSPL. When he protested, Vikranth warned that criminal cases would be filed against him and his family members. The share transfer was done in a hurried manner without due diligence, Rao alleged, adding that Vikranth told him he was following instructions of Jagan.He further alleged that his 41.1% stake in KSPL and 48.74% stake in KSEZ were taken over for just Rs 494 crore and Rs 12 crore, respectively. According to him, even by conservative estimates, value of KSPL would be over Rs 2,500 crore, as it already had a share purchase agreement of Rs 400 crore with GMR Group, which is a majority stakeholder in KSEZ.","Andhra Pradesh CID filed a case against YSRCP Rajya Sabha MP V Vijaysai Reddy, his son-in-law P Sharath Chandra Reddy and Y Vikranth Reddy.

They are not ministers. You were the minister of the department where this alleged recruitment scam took place. Look at the recovery of huge sums of money from firms, virtually owned by you and your associate Arpita Mukherjee,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan said.Chatterjee's counsel, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, said the accused is a first time offender and he must get the benefit of bail having served one-third of the maximum sentence that could be imposed if he gets convicted. Enforcement Directorate's counsel, additional solicitor general S V Raju, said the beneficial provision of the Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita did not apply as many cases are pending against Chatterjee.When Rohatgi said this reflects the sadistic attitudes of ED and CBI to get him embroiled in case after case so that he does not get out of jail on bail, the Justice Kant-led bench said, ""When the minister is the kingpin in a scam, and SC grants him bail, what message it sends to society? That a powerful and influential person can get bail? On the face of it you are corrupt.""However, the bench was quick to clarify that since the investigation is going on and there is no likelihood of trial getting completed in the near future, the court has to balance the rights of the accused with suitable conditions to ensure there is a fair investigation without any impediments.Rohatgi offered that Chatterjee would stay out of the territory of Bengal for a period of six months if that helped ED to complete investigations without apprehending any obstruction from the accused. ""Chatterjee has been removed from TMC,"" he said, indicating that he does not wield any influence through state govt.Raju opposed the bail, saying Chatterjee was the mastermind of the scam in recruitment of teachers and group C&D employees for schools, and instrumental in depriving nearly 50,000 genuine candidates of their jobs by giving these to undeserving candidates in consideration of bribes. SC reserved verdict on Chatterjee's bail plea.Rohatgi said identical were the charges against TN minister Senthil Balaji, but SC had granted him bail. The bench said there is no parity between a TN minister and a WB minister. ""After all there is no association of ministers in this country,"" it said.","Former West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee is seeking bail in a money laundering case related to the teachers recruitment scam.

NHAI launches rating system for contractors to tackle poor highway maintenance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-launches-rating-system-for-contractors-to-tackle-poor-highway-maintenance/articleshow/115982317.cms,"NEW DELHI: Facing criticism for poor maintenance of highway stretches and the bad riding quality caused by potholes and cracks, the NHAI on Wednesday launched a mechanism to rate contractors engaged in the operation and maintenance of such stretches. Contractors scoring less than 60 out of 100 will be declared “non-performers”, reducing their chances of securing new projects.The scores and ratings will be based on an objective assessment of five main parameters: roughness, potholes, rut depth, surface cracking, patchwork, and ravelling (dislodging of coarse aggregate on the surface). They will be uploaded on the NHAI website and its social media handles, which, officials said, is aimed at encouraging contractors to improve their performance.The focus on highway maintenance has gained significance, considering that over the past 10 years, approximately 95,000 km of national highways and expressways have been widened or constructed.NHAI will deploy network survey vehicles (NSVs) fitted with cameras and sensors on the NH network to assess the condition. Officials said the NSVs will capture details of every 100 meters of the NH and the data will be transferred to a central database automatically within 48 hours for processing and actions.Officials said that to begin with 21,000 km of network under NHAI will be covered and in the next phase another 24,000 km will be brought under this regime. They added that the NSVs will cover every NH stretch once in six months.TOI has learnt that at present 7-8 NSVs are deployed for collecting and feeding data into the system, but till now this was being done manually. “In the new system we will have no manual intervention as the 3D details will be captured by cameras and sensors. This data will be transferred seamlessly and it will be processed within 10 days. Subsequently, the system will generate notices for the contractors concerned for taking corrective action. Colour codes will be used for faster action. We have deployed specialised manpower for this as well,” an official said.Sources said if the contractors don’t improve the road condition within the specific timeline, NHAI will carry out improvement and recover the cost from such players.","The scores and ratings will be based on an objective assessment of five main parameters: roughness, potholes, rut depth, surface cracking, patchwork, and ravelling.

'Exempt us from deploying CAT II/III planes at Bangalore & Kolkata': Akasa to DGCA; else warns of 'disruptions',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/exempt-us-from-deploying-cat-ii/iii-planes-at-bangalore-kolkata-akasa-to-dgca-else-warns-of-disruptions/articleshow/115980819.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid its pilot training troubles, Akasa has sought regulatory exemption from deploying aircraft equipped to take off and land (CAT II/III) in low visibility conditions along with pilots trained to do so at Bengaluru and Kolkata for flights to operate from 9 pm to early morning. The almost 2.5-year-old airline has warned of “significant disruptions” at these airports and causing hardship to passengers.Following the early onset of fog this unusually warm winter, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) had last month made it mandatory for airlines to deploy aircraft with CATII/III landing and low visibility take off (LVTO) systems along with pilots trained on the same on night to morning flights at airports like Delhi, Amritsar, Jaipur, Lucknow, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Akasa, which has over 840 pilots for its current fleet of 26 Boeing 737 MAX planes, has been facing pilot training issues and sources say the required number of trained pilots are not available with them for CAT III landings at their Bangalore base.The airline is already under scanner when DGCA has red-flagged this in the recent past. The regulator had recently issued Akasa a show cause for alleged training lapses, including wrong minima certification of a simulator on which some pilots were trained to operate in low visibility. So, while the airline has the required number of low visibility operation compliant planes and crew to cover north India operations, doing so in Kolkata and Bengaluru is proving to be challenging this winter.While Akasa did not comment on this issue, airline sources said: “CAT (II/III) trainings as required by the regulator are typically achieved in a phased manner, as an airline progresses in its operations from inception. Akasa has been working closely with the DGCA and aims to train the requisite number of CAT3 compliant pilots in a timely manner as mandated by the regulator. Akasa has ensured it protects all fog-prone destinations along the northern region of its network.”“In public interest and keeping in mind the safety and security of passengers, DGCA has correctly extended this mandate nationwide. As there is a variance in topography of southern and northern states, Bengaluru will be impacted differently than Delhi, and this is the area in which Akasa will now work to enhance its capabilities and ensure it flies within regulations while providing a reliable and efficient experience to its customers,” Akasa sources said.The “traditional” fog window is Dec 10 to Feb 10 but this year while temperatures are yet to dip, low visibility made its debut early Nov itself. The DGCA then preponed its fog window and asked airlines to deploy aircraft II/III-compliant aircraft with pilots trained to land in low visibility at many airports.",Akasa has sought regulatory exemption from deploying aircraft equipped to take off and land (CAT II/III) in low visibility conditions.

Talk about a Superman Punch to cancer!The Excellence of Execution proved he could apply his technical prowess outside the ring too. Bret Hart, known for his precision in the ring, approached his prostate cancer diagnosis with the same methodical determination. He caught it early, tackled it head-on, and true to his moniker, executed a flawless victory against the disease, as per BBC Jim Duggan, the patriotic powerhouse, faced off against kidney cancer in 1998. True to his tough guy persona, Duggan didn’t just beat cancer, he body slammed it out of the ring until 2021, when cancer tried to come for round two. However, he was back to waving the American flag and wielding his trusty 2x4 in 2023, showing that his fighting spirit extended far beyond the wrestling ring.Former Divas Champion Michelle McCool, The Undertaker 's wife, proved she was truly “flawless” when she faced skin cancer in 2016, as per The Score . Always an advocate for early detection, McCool’s vigilance paid off when she caught the disease in its early stages. She tackled treatment with the same determination she showed in the ring, emerging victorious and using her platform to raise awareness about skin cancer prevention.Zack Ryder, known for his energetic and entertaining style, faced a battle with lymphoma as a teenager. He underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments and made a full recovery. His positive outlook and determination throughout his journey inspired many, demonstrating the power of resilience in the face of adversity.These five superstars remind us that while wrestling may be scripted, the courage and resilience they’ve shown in their personal battles are 100% real.

Apple India vs China

Even as India's Apple iPhone manufacturing capabilities are swiftly approaching China's levels, the country's contribution to Apple's global revenue remains significantly lower, primarily due to consumer affordability constraints.Indian manufacturing facilities produced 14-15% of Apple's total iPhone output in FY24. Industry analysts project this share to expand to 26-30% by 2027. Currently, India stands as Apple's sole iPhone manufacturing alternative to China, with Greater China encompassing Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.Predictions indicate India's iPhone production volumes could match China's within five years. However, achieving comparable revenue contributions to Apple's global operations could take 10-15 years.Apple achieved a record $8 billion in revenue from India in FY24, but this represented just above 2% of its global revenue of $391 billion. In contrast, Greater China generated $66.95 billion, accounting for more than 17%. Projections suggest Apple's India revenue could reach $11 billion by FY26, following the company's October-September fiscal calendar.In FY20, China's contribution to Apple's total revenue stood at 14.68%, whilst India accounted for 0.66%. Apple's India revenue includes sales across its product range, including iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and services, although local manufacturing figures are not included in Apple India 's accounts.Industry experts informed ET that Apple's 2020 decision to establish manufacturing in India aimed to diversify production amidst US-China tensions and develop an export hub, despite awareness of limited domestic market potential due to lower per capita income.Apple has emerged as the pioneering global value chain to establish India as its export centre. An official monitoring Apple's progress under the government's smartphone PLI scheme stated, ""Currently, 70% of iPhones are exported and this figure would rise to 80-85% soon as capacity ramps up.""Also Read | Fastest manufacturing growth in 50 years? Apple’s India business surpasses Rs 2 lakh crore; tech giant India’s largest global value chain Whilst other international phone makers like Samsung from South Korea and Chinese companies Xiaomi, Oppo, and Realme focus mainly on domestic market production, Samsung stands as India's second-largest smartphone exporter after Apple, exporting 30-35% of its local production.Industry experts note that despite India's substantial market potential, its lower per capita income affects Apple's revenue growth.For context, China's per capita income is five times higher than India's, making it Apple's second-biggest iPhone market after the US. According to industry data, Apple's production in India from April to October 2024 exceeded $9 billion, with exports reaching nearly $7 billion, setting a company record in India.In India's mobile phone market, which ranks second globally, iPhones maintain a modest 6-7% share of the total smartphone market. The remaining 94% consists of Android platform devices from competitors like Samsung, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, alongside some domestic brands.An analyst observed, ""This gives Apple a long runway to increase the size of its domestic sales and market share."" India predominantly focuses on iPhones, although Apple's MacBook laptops have performed well in FY24. Whilst iPhones constitute about 52% of Apple's global revenue at $201.1 billion, industry specialists indicate that in India, iPhone sales make up 65-70% of Apple's revenue.","Apple achieved a record $8 billion in revenue from India in FY24, but this represented just above 2% of its global revenue of $391 billion.

Bo Nix will shine for Payton’s Broncos



This winter, Denver’s buzz isn’t about chili—it’s all about rookie QB Bo Nix . His stunning 93-yard touchdown against the Browns has Broncos Country talking. With Coach Sean Payton trusting Nix and his ""don’t over-coach"" approach, the rookie is showing promise. But can his flashes of brilliance push the Broncos into playoff contention? Only time will tell.Denver’s winter chatter is surprisingly focused on rookie QB Bo Nix, not Green Chili recipes. After his gutsy 93-yard bomb against the Browns, a third-and-11 from his own end zone, it’s clear Sean Payton’s trust in Nix is paying off. Payton’s “don’t over-coach” philosophy was on full display, with the coach admitting, “You have to be careful you’re not over-coaching.”Tom Brady , never one to shy away from QB talk, echoed Payton’s approach on Colin Cowherd’s show, emphasizing the fine line between trust and control. “The trust that a coach has in a player, it manifests itself all the time,” said Brady, whose two-decade dynasty proved the power of trust between QB and coach.Brady explained that when a coach believes their QB will make the right decision, there’s no need for micromanagement. In the NFL, trust unlocks both the coach and QB’s potential, and micromanaging rarely leads to success.Brady’s dynamic with Bill Belichick is the ultimate example. Despite occasional clashes, Belichick’s faith in Brady’s high-pressure decision-making helped net six Super Bowl rings.Yet, Broncos Country remains divided. While Nix has shown brilliance, his technical inconsistencies are hard to ignore, and with an 8-5 record, those flashes alone may not be enough to secure a playoff spot.Also Read: Kayla Nicole inspires with bold message of confidence, self-love, and embracing every flaw Bo Nix’s performance against the Browns wasn’t his best. While the Broncos got the win, completing just 51.4% of passes with two interceptions isn’t exactly ideal. But as rookie lessons go, every game is a step forward. As Tom Brady put it, Nix is in good hands with Sean Payton, who’s focused on helping him grow through the bumps.With 2,842 yards, 17 touchdowns, 8 interceptions, and an 87.9 passer rating in 13 games, Nix is showing promise, but Broncos fans want to see those mechanics tightened up. Payton’s approach? Focus on rhythm, not perfection, letting Nix play without overthinking.It’s a balancing act, but with a solid 8-5 record, Payton’s method is working. As the postseason nears, can Nix keep improving? Only time will tell, but Broncos Country is in for an exciting ride.","Broncos rookie QB Bo Nix has shown flashes of brilliance.

However, he was immediately re-arrested by Delhi Police under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).Balyan, the Uttam Nagar legislator, faces allegations of collaborating with gangster Kapil Sangwan’s syndicate to pressure property owners into selling their assets at significantly reduced prices. The case, which dates back to last year, has raised questions about his alleged nexus with organised crime in Delhi.Following the bail order, Balyan was taken from the Rouse Avenue Court to the Crime Branch office for further legal proceedings under MCOCA.Meanwhile, Advocate Dr N C Sharma advocating for Balyan said, ""We will challenge the grounds of arrest under MCOCA. There are some provisions in it but the police have not followed them. The police are not aware of the FIR...As per law, this arrest is totally illegal...""Earlier, the court had extended his police custody by one day on Tuesday, allowing investigators more time to interrogate him. The prosecution argued that Balyan needed to be confronted with two victims who had come forward with new evidence.One victim alleged that Balyan’s aide had forcibly occupied their property, while another claimed they were threatened into selling their property at a loss. Police emphasised that the extension was critical to unearth the “deep-rooted nexus” between Balyan and Sangwan’s gang and to identify other associates.Despite these submissions, the court granted bail, stating that the prosecution lacked sufficient grounds to justify continued detention.Senior advocate Manish Vashisht, representing Balyan, challenged the legality of the arrest, calling it baseless. “I (Balyan), myself am a victim and have been made into an accused by police. They have arrested a public servant and did not give any reason for doing so. The arrest is completely illegal and without any basis,” Vashisht argued.The police, however, maintained that the custodial interrogation was essential due to emerging details from the investigation.The re-arrest under MCOCA marks a significant escalation in the case, with authorities asserting that further inquiries are necessary to unravel the alleged criminal network involving the MLA.",Naresh Balyan was immediately re-arrested by Delhi Police under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) The Uttam Nagar legislator faces allegations of collaborating with gangster Kapil Sangwan’s syndicate to pressure property owners into selling their assets at significantly reduced prices.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115974816,imgsize-1399634,width-400,resizemode-4/115974816.jpg"

NFL advances toward permitting Marijuana use among players



Can Weed Lead to a Reduction in NFL Concussions? | WEEDIQUETTE

Undoubtedly, the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) have very recently made significant revisions to their substance abuse policy, the most progressive set of reforms yet put in place by the league vis-à-vis marijuana . Such an amendment to the policy-altering fines and suspensions-also brings with it some changes such as raising THC levels for positive tests.As of now, the limit for concentration of THC was raised from 150 ng/ml to 350 ng/ml. The amount of THC in a person's system will have to be significantly more than average for a player to test positive. Getting an idea, ""Generally, a week of regular use under this threshold would be past 350 ng/ml,"" to know that the upgraded threshold can give players further leeway with a failed test.Moreover, policy changes go beyond the THC threshold. Fines imposed on players who test positive for THC have also dropped significantly. If a player has been to first offense, he now pays a fine of 15,000 dollars as opposed to 50 percent of his pay as a penalty for the first offense. For second offenses, the level of penalty incurred will be 20,000 dollars. This is from a previous level penalty of a full game check. Further reductions come for later offenses: third offenses, which previously incurred penalties equivalent to the amounts of two game checks, now leave the player with only one game check deduction for the offense. If four or more offenses are leveled against the person, the fine fine falls from three game checks to two.These policy reforms also come with lowered fines over missed tests and indicate how the league is changing its approach regarding player marijuana use. They are indeed the product of a much earlier shake-up in 2020, when the NFL limited the scope under which suspensions could be issued for substances-abuse violations to a great extent. Such cases are rare now, as an athlete now incurs a financial penalty.Furthermore, the amendment does not leave a complete absence of marijuana prohibition but brings the league closer to decriminalization. The newly modified policy is an immediate evidence of the reality fast and changing social opinions, as well as growing scientific studies concerning marijuana. In 2022, the NFL did learn to part with a cool million dollars in research funding aimed to assess the effects of cannabinoids on pain and concussion neuroprotection in football players. This initiative, which includes teams from the University of California San Diego and University of Regina, is meant to underline the NFL’s commitment to the benefits of cannabis in the therapeutic application with its players.Also Read: “I think it is ridiculous"": Aaron Rodgers dismisses proving his value to Jets in remaining five games, calls it an absurd notion In summary, the NFL’s revamped substance abuse policy marks a significant move towards a more player-friendly approach, reducing financial penalties and making marijuana use less of a risk for players. While marijuana is not fully legalized within the league, these changes indicate a growing acceptance of its role in the lives of professional athletes.",The NFL and the NFL Players Association have made significant revisions to their substance abuse policy.

NEW DELHI: Residents in Delhi experienced some relief on Thursday as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to the ‘moderate’ category following weeks of severe pollution. The AQI was recorded at 161 as of 8am according to the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ).Despite the improvement, a thin layer of smog covered the city as winter set in, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting a minimum temperature of 9°C, accompanied by mist in the air.The AQI varied across different areas of Delhi, with Anand Vihar at 178, Chandni Chowk at 194, and ITO at 130, all falling under the 'moderate' category. However, areas like RK Puram (204), Mundka (222), and Shadipur (249) recorded 'poor' air quality.An AQI between 101-200 is categorized as 'moderate,' 201-300 as 'poor,' and 301-400 as 'very poor.' The city had been grappling with 'severe' and 'very poor' air quality post-Diwali, leading to breathing difficulties and health complaints among residents.To tackle the worsening pollution, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-IV measures were enforced, including a ban on BS-IV diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles, except for essential services.As the winter chill sets in, Delhi’s minimum temperature dropped to 9°C on Thursday, signaling the onset of colder weather.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Billy brings 32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the country. He then served 12 years in Congress, because he 'felt it was important for his constituents to have a Representative who has signed the front of a check!'"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Daniel Werfel, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022, currently leads the IRS. Werfel, who brought experience from both Democratic and Republican administrations as a former management consultant and civil servant, was meant to serve until 2027.The Republican party has consistently opposed the Biden administration's IRS strategy, particularly the allocation of approximately $80 billion in additional funding over ten years. GOP representatives successfully reduced this amount by $20 billion and continue to seek further reductions. The IRS faces public unpopularity, with Republicans frequently criticising it as intrusive and inefficient, New York Times reported.Budget specialists indicate that increased IRS funding helps generate government revenue through improved tax law enforcement and collection of owed taxes.Long, who previously worked as an auctioneer, did not participate in the House tax-writing committee during his congressional tenure. However, he demonstrated his auctioneering abilities in Washington, notably when Trump invited him to conduct a lighthearted auction of the Stanley Cup during the St. Louis Blues' White House visit.Trump stated on social media: ""I have known Billy since 2011 - He is an extremely hard worker, and respected by all, especially by those who know him in Congress. Taxpayers and the wonderful employees of the IRS will love having Billy at the helm.""Traditionally, presidents do not appoint new IRS commissioners upon taking office, and Long's appointment requires Senate confirmation. Biden waited for Charles P. Rettig's term to conclude before appointing Werfel.In a recent Tax Notes podcast, Werfel expressed: ""I have a vision of my last day on the job being Nov. 12, 2027. My frame of mind on the IRS is that it's nonpartisan, is that our priorities can and should shift with new Treasury leadership.""","US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated former Missouri Republican congressman Billy Long as the head of the Internal Revenue Service.
