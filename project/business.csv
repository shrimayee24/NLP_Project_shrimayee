NEW DELHI: Born in a scheduled caste family in Peermade village in Idukki district of Kerala, C T Ravikumar decided to study law after graduating in zoology leading to a four-decade long career and his becoming a judge of the highest court through sheer hard work, proficiency and ability to win hearts both in the courts and outside.Justice Ravikumar retires on Jan 5. He sat on a ceremonial farewell bench with CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar on Friday. Attorney general R Venkataramani recited a poem composed in his honour – “Soft in demeanour, sure in speech; Frail in walk, firm in views; Acumen sharp, attentions deep: Gentle looks but questioning eyes; … Mind so open, thoughts all clear: Hiding no riders, equal treatment with lines none drawn.”CJI Khanna said the poem captured Justice Ravikumar’s personality so completely. “He belongs to God's own country and is loved by all, bar and bench. He is a noble soul who has won over hearts with his humane qualities. His love for cricket and nature is well known. He comes from a rural background unlike many of us hailing from the cities and towns having access to better facilities. His reaching the highest court as a judge is an achievement in itself,” the CJI said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Justice Ravikumar is simplicity personified and never carried the stature of a Judge. SCBA president Kapil Sibal said though the judge was an ardent cricket lover, he never bowled a googly to the lawyers. SCoARA president Vipin Nair, referring to his love for cricket, said his first innings had been spectacular and wished him a fulfilling second innings.Justice Ravikumar said, “Even after getting appointed as a judge of the HC and then as a Judge of the SC, one thing that never left me is the feeling of being a lawyer. That’s where I belong and that’s why I respect all lawyers.”“Traditionally, the Indians bat well in the second innings, I wish I will bat well in my second innings (after retirement career),” he said. He started practicing in 1986 in the district courts at Mavelikara. He shifted practice to Kerala HC in 1996 and was appointed a judge of the HC on Jan 5, 2009. He took oath as a judge of the SC on Aug 31, 2021 and had a tenure of little over three years and four months as a SC judge.",C T Ravikumar decided to study law after graduating in zoology leading to a four-decade long career.

As the new year dawns, hope and positivity bloom. The ancient Romans named the first month 'January' after Janus, the enigmatic deity of beginnings, transitions, duality and doorways.My relationship with January has metamorphosed through life's seasons. In childhood, it meant returning to school after half-yearly examinations and the anticipation of annual day celebrations, while in college years, it was about the enchanting Mardi Gras at IIT Madras. January became a symbol of romance when my husband chose this month to propose; it was also the month I became pregnant. In professional life, it meant bonuses and promotions while now, January serves as a gentle reminder to infuse the coming year with purpose, health and joy.Each year, as I retire the old calendar and welcome its successor, emotions ripple through me. Time's passage prompts soul-searching: What treasures did I gather, what burdens did I shed? Did my spiritual baggage grow heavier, and did I learn the art of letting go? Can I embrace my past with serenity while greeting the future with hope?Janus' dual visage offers profound wisdom — one face contemplating the past, the other gazing into the future. His twin aspects speak to something deeper: the ability to hold opposing perspectives in balance, to seek reconciliation between conflicting viewpoints.As Jean-Paul Sartre observed, ""There is no black and white, only a strong grey."" Truth dwells not in absolutes but in nuances, not in judgments but in understanding, not in success or failure but in persistence.This idea echoes in the opening of the Mahabharata — Prince Janamejayan's vengeful sacrifice. Grieving his father's death by snakebite, he initiated the Sarpa Satra, a ritual to destroy all serpents.One by one, the serpents perished in the sacrificial flames until the moment Takshaka, along with his serpent wife, were about to meet their end. Young sage Astika suddenly stepped forward and halted the sacrifice by requesting the life of Takshaka as his reward, a right that could not be denied to a sage during a yagna. Born to a Brahmin father and serpent mother, Astika embodied the union of opposites.When Janamejayan protested, the great sage Vyasa, his own great-grandfather, said, ""Child,"" he said, ""in seeking to destroy all darkness, you risk creating an imbalance far more dangerous than the evil you wish to eliminate. Just as night follows day in the eternal cycle, so must light and shadow coexist in nature and in human hearts.""Vyasa commanded Vaishampayana to narrate his work 'Jaya', where the mighty Arjuna, ancestor to Janamejayan, navigated the complex waters between dharma and adharma, right and wrong, justice and mercy, light and darkness.This eternal truth finds voice in Tamil sage Thiruvalluvar's immortal words. When you judge or assess a person — whether a life partner, friend, foe or a colleague — do not see only what you want to see. Assess the brighter side and the darker side, check which one over-shadows the other and accept both and see the positive aspects first.Embrace life's inherent duality; perfection lies not in purity but in balance.As we step through January's door, may we carry this wisdom forward, understanding that life's richness dwells not in extremes but in the delicate dance between past and future, acceptance and growth.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116919299,imgsize-60046,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/116919299.jpg"

A school in a Nashik backwater is creating ripples with all that and more, drawing Maharashtra education minister Dada Bhuse to the remote tribal hamlet within weeks of taking charge.The whiz-kids at the zilla parishad school at Hiwali village in Trimbakeshwar taluka are no bookworms, though. They blend classroom lessons with practical skills such as welding, electrical work and organic farming, reflecting a holistic approach to education.Most of those achievements have come through the innovative efforts of Keshav Gavit . ""This extraordinary commitment to learning not only fostered a deep love for schooling among the children but also cultivated remarkable academic abilities in them,"" Gavit said.Interacting with students when he visited Hiwali for a first-hand tour of the school last week, Bhuse was amazed by their enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge, and awestruck by the dexterity of some who could write with both hands. It was a testament to the power of perseverance and transformative impact of quality education. ""The emphasis on speaking English, general knowledge, and arts, along with cultivation of organic vegetables by students, showcases an inclusive and expansive education model,"" he said.Hiwali's educational transformation began in 2009 when the village, with limited access to basic amenities, had just nine students. The challenges were daunting as a significant portion of the village's population had minimal exposure to education. Through persistent efforts, home visits, and a focus on improving basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills, a foundation was laid for a better future. ""By 2014, the school began to flourish,"" Gavit said. He said Bhuse spoke about presenting the school as a blueprint for educational excellence in the state.","Hiwali's educational transformation began in 2009 when the village, with limited access to basic amenities, had just nine students.

"Under new policy, Lieutenant Generals to be promoted on merit basis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-new-policy-lieutenant-generals-to-be-promoted-on-merit-basis/articleshow/116929166.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India moving towards the creation of tri-Service theatre commands, the Army has adopted a radical change in the promotion policy for top officers by making it necessary for all Lieutenant Generals to be graded on their performance through a “quantified assessment system”.This new system, which will come into force from March 31, will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex-level appointments in the integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments, sources told TOI.The new policy for Lt-Gens, with “revised annual confidential report (ACR) forms”, will not apply to the vice chief and commanders-in-chief of the six operational commands and one training command in the Army. These eight officers are also Lt-Gens but a rung higher than the other three-star generals.The over 11-lakh Army has almost 90 Lt-Gens, 300 Major Generals and 1,200 Brigadiers in its 43,000-strong officer cadre. “The new policy for Lt-Gens will align the Army with the much smaller IAF and Navy, where the quantified appraisal of equivalent ranks (Air Marshals and Vice Admirals) is already there,” a source said.“There was no quantified ACR system for Lt-Gens so far. Now, they will be graded on different attributes on a scale from 1 to 9. In effect, promotions will be based on merit rather than just seniority. The impending creation of theatre commands requires a uniform assessment system for the top ranks in all the three Services,” he added.The Army headquarters’ letter on the new policy does not specify whether it will also be applicable for the selection of the vice-chief and seven commanders-in-chief within the force.As per the existing Army policy, promotion to the C-in-C level is based purely on seniority, in conjunction with the date of birth and vacancies available. A Lt-Gen, after he has commanded one of the 14 corps in the force, must have `residual’ service of 18 months (till he turns 60) to be promoted as the C-in-C of one of the seven Army commands.Strong reservations against the new policy are already being expressed by some officers. “Very few officers become three-star generals after being assessed on merit at every step in their careers in the Army’s steeply-pyramidical structure,” a senior officer said.“After the Lt-Gen rank, promotion to C-in-C was based on seniority. Introducing merit at this stage will open the door for interference, political or otherwise,” he added.The policy comes at a time when the blueprint for the three theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region has been finalized to ensure an integrated war-fighting machinery. Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan has already made presentations to defence minister Rajnath Singh and national security advisor Ajit Doval on the matter.As per the existing plan, which entails the most radical military reorganization in the country since Independence, the China-specific northern theatre command will come up in Lucknow, while the western one for Pakistan will be based in Jaipur. The maritime theatre command, in turn, will be located at Thiruvananthapuram, as earlier reported by TOI.",New system will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex- level appointments in integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments.

'AAPda': PM Modi slams AAP as corrupt and disaster for Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aapda-pm-modi-slams-aap-as-corrupt-and-disaster-for-delhi/articleshow/116928992.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Modi launched a scathing attack on AAP on Friday, calling it ""AAPda"" (Hindi for disaster), virtually setting the tone for an aggressive and high-pitched campaign for the assembly elections to be held in the capital in February.Speaking at an event in Ashok Vihar while inaugurating various development initiatives, the PM gave the slogan, ""AAPda ko nahi sahenge, badal ke rahenge (We will not tolerate the disaster, will change things)."" He repeated the slogan several times with the crowd joining him amidst loud cheers. Accusing AAP of putting brakes on Delhi's development, the PM said voters have now decided to get rid of the party.""This is the country's capital and it is the right of people to get good governance. But in the past 10 years, Delhi has been in the grip of a big AAPda,"" he said.""By putting Anna Hazareji at the forefront, some kattar beimaan people pushed Delhi into aapda,"" he added.This was an indirect jibe at AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, who has in the past called himself ""kattar imaandar (hardcore honest)"". AAP functionaries, including Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, are facing corruption charges in the excise policy case.Modi accused AAP of engaging in corruption in liquor policy, schools, treatment of the poor, fight against pollution and jobs. ""These people talked about Delhi's development but have now become an 'aapda' on Delhi,"" he said. He accused them of engaging in open corruption and then glorifying it.This was Modi's first political speech ahead of the state polls when, again without taking names, he targeted Kejriwal over renovation of the CM's residence on 6 Flag Staff Road in Civil Lines. He said he could have also built a ""sheesh mahal"" for himself, but his dream was to ensure homes for everyone in the country.""The country knows very well that Modi never built a house for himself, but in the past 10 years, I fulfilled the dreams of over four crore poor families by providing them with homes,"" he said.Taking a swipe at the AAP govt, the PM said in areas where it can't intervene, work gets done. ""In DDA, there is not much intervention of AAPda, so it is able to give so many houses to the poor and middle class, supplying gas through pipelines,"" he said. He said construction of highways and expressways in Delhi is progressing because there is no involvement of AAP govt in these projects.He also targeted AAP over non-implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi. Modi said that because of the city govt not allowing the Centre's signature health insurance scheme and other programmes to be implemented in the capital, he was unable to fully help the people living here despite efforts.In an attempt to counter AAP's free electricity scheme, the PM said the central govt is making electricity bill zero with Pradhan Mantri Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojna. Under this scheme, people are even earning. ""The BJP govt is giving Rs 78,000 to a family to install solar panels,"" he said.PM Narendra Modi said the central govt is providing free ration to nearly 75 lakh needy people in Delhi.","PM Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on AAP on Friday, calling it ""AAPda"" (Hindi for disaster) Accusing AAP of putting brakes on Delhi's development, the PM said voters have now decided to get rid of the party.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday said it had registered a ""solemn protest"" with China over its approval for construction of a massive dam on the Brahmaputra River , and further accused Beijing of "" illegal occupation "" after it made a unilateral decision to create two new administrative counties that assert jurisdiction over areas that fall under the Ladakh region.""We have seen the information released by Xinhua on 25 December 2024 regarding a hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. As a lower riparian state with established user rights to the waters of the river, we have consistently expressed, through expert-level and diplomatic channels, our views and concerns to the Chinese side over mega projects on rivers in their territory. These concerns have been reiterated, along with the need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries , following the latest report,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said addressing a press briefing.""The Chinese side has been urged to ensure that the interests of downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas. We will continue to monitor and take necessary measures to protect our interests,"" Jaiswal added.Jaiswal's response followed China's approval of constructing the world's largest dam on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet, near the Indian border, a project described as the planet's biggest.Estimated to cost $137 billion, the mega infrastructure project has raised alarm in downstream countries, including India and Bangladesh, over potential impacts on water flow and regional stability.The anticipated investment could surpass one trillion yuan ($137 billion), making it significantly larger than any existing infrastructure project globally, including China's Three Gorges Dam, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Thursday.Read more: China plans world's largest dam on Brahmaputra The dam is planned to be constructed at a massive gorge in the Himalayan region, where the Brahmaputra river makes a sharp U-turn before entering Arunachal Pradesh and flowing into Bangladesh.India has raised concerns over the dam, as it not only empowers China to control the river’s water flow but also poses the risk of flooding border areas by releasing large volumes of water during potential hostilities due to its sheer size and scale, news agency PTI reported.Responding to China's establishment of two new counties in Ladakh, Randhir Jaiswal stated, ""We have lodged a solemn protest with the Chinese side through diplomatic channels.""""We have seen the announcement pertaining to the establishment of two new counties in Hotan Prefecture of China.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai 26/11 attack accused Tahawwur Rana is making his final legal attempt to avoid extradition to India . His lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, has appealed to the US Supreme Court , challenging the lower court's ruling, arguing that extradition would violate the double jeopardy principle , which protects against being tried twice for the same crime.Rana's lawyer stated that the court should prevent the extradition based on how ""offence"" is defined in the US-India extradition treaty. Dratel argued, ""The (Supreme) Court should grant the writ. On the merits, it should hold that the term ""offence"" in the double jeopardy provision of the United States-India extradition treaty (and many other similar treaties) refers to the conduct underlying the charges in the two countries, rather than the elements of the crimes the respective countries have charged.""The US top court will confer on this matter on January 17.Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian citizen and currently in Los Angeles, was found to be connected to David Headley , a key conspirator in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. He was previously tried in Chicago for his links to the attacks which resulted in 166 deaths, including six Americans. Rana’s legal team contends the charges in India stem from the same actions already addressed in the Chicago trial.However, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar disagrees. She told the Supreme Court, ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case."" She pointed to India’s forgery accusations against Rana, relating to a fraudulent application he submitted to the Reserve Bank of India, as an example of conduct not addressed in the US prosecution.This comes as the US government in December supported India's request to extradite Rana. The US Solicitor General Prelogar had called upon the US Supreme Court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Read full story: US government asks Supreme Court to dismiss Tahawwur Rana's plea Prior to this, Rana had appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful.

NEW DELHI: AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday responded sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's criticism of the AAP-led Delhi government . Kejriwal dismissed the allegations, saying that the BJP-led central government has failed to deliver on its promises while the AAP government has worked tirelessly for the people of Delhi.Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said, ""Today, PM Modi gave a speech of 43 minutes, in which he abused the people of Delhi and the government they chose for around 39 minutes"".""In 2015, the people of Delhi chose two governments—BJP at the Centre and AAP in Delhi. It has been 10 years now. If you ask me to list what the AAP government has accomplished in these 10 years, even 2-3 hours would not be sufficient,"" he added.Former Delhi CM also fired back at PM Modi's ""sheesh mahal"" remark, ""One who builds a house worth Rs 2,700 crore for himself, who travels in an airplane worth Rs 8,400 crore, and who wears a Rs 10 lakh suit, talking about 'sheesh mahal' doesn't suit his mouth. I don’t indulge in personal accusations or the politics of abuses.""Kejriwal also pointed out AAP’s achievements in governance, contrasting them with the BJP ’s record. He accused the central government of failing to fulfill its promises, particularly regarding housing for the underprivileged.""In 2020, PM Modi made several promises to the people of Delhi. The BJP’s 'Sankalp Patra' stated that everyone in Delhi would get a pucca house by 2022. But since then, the Centre has handed over keys to only 1,700 houses. Before that, they handed over 3,000 houses in Kalkaji. So, they have built 4,700 houses in five years, while Delhi has 4 lakh jhuggis and 15 lakh people needing homes,"" Kejriwal said.He further accused the BJP of being anti-poor, saying, ""The BJP is the enemy of the poor. They have rendered over two lakh people homeless by demolishing slums in Delhi. Had they worked in these 10 years, maybe they wouldn’t need to abuse the people of Delhi so much today. One who works doesn’t abuse; one who doesn’t work contests elections on the basis of abuses.""AAP supremo Kejriwal's reaction came after PM Modi's address at inauguration of multiple development projects in Delhi.With assembly elections approaching in Delhi, AAP and BJP leaders are seen in the war of words. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the AAP government as an ""aapda"" (disaster) for the national capital.""On the one hand, the Centre is making a lot of efforts; on the other, the Union Territory government stands for brazen lies,"" PM Modi said, accusing AAP of corruption in sectors like education, pollution control, and housing.Calling for AAP’s defeat, PM also raised a slogan, ""'Aapda' ko nahi sahenge, badal kar rahenge (we will not tolerate 'aapda,' we will remove it),"" and urged voters to usher in a new era of governance under the BJP.","AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal responded sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's criticism of the AAP-led Delhi government.

Nationally, the coastline increase compared to 1970 data stands at 47.6%. This major upward revision of coastline length across nine states and UTs is attributed primarily to using a new methodology to measure India's maritime parameter, as established by the National Maritime Security Coordinator.Unlike older methods that relied on straight-line distance measurements, the scientifically updated approach incorporates the measurement of complex coastal formations such as bays, estuaries, inlets, and other geomorphological features.According to experts, this refined methodology provides a more precise representation of the true length of the coastline, capturing its dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics. Coastline data from 1970, as reported by the National Hydrographic Office and Survey of India, was based on the measurement techniques and technologies available at the time.While Gujarat retains its position as the state with the longest coastline, Tamil Nadu, with a revised length of 1,068km (previously 906km), has overtaken Andhra Pradesh (1,053km), based on the new survey.Puducherry's coastline - including Karaikal, Yanam, and Mahe - contracted by 4.9km, marking a departure from the upward revision elsewhere.Kerala reported the smallest increase, adding 30km (5%) to its coastline.

"1.5 million cases/year, but just 1 out of 4 Indians has access to stroke-ready hospitals: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-5-million-cases/year-but-just-1-out-of-4-indians-has-access-to-stroke-ready-hospitals-study/articleshow/116926442.cms,"NEW DELHI: Only a fourth of India's population has access to stroke-ready hospitals , claims a new study.India sees nearly 1.5 million stroke cases every year of which nearly 85 to 90 per cent are caused by a clot in the major blood vessels of the brain.Treatment involves injecting drugs to break up the clot, also referred to as Intravenous Thrombolysis (IVT) and/or removal of the clot through a minimally invasive procedure which is referred to as endovascular treatment (EVT).In the study, published in the International Journal of Stroke (IJS), researchers collated data on IVT and EVT capable centers across the country and used a distance matrix developed by Google to find the driving distance between each population centre and its nearest stroke facility.They found that there were a total of 566 IVT capable stroke centres across the country of which 361 (63 per cent ) were EVT capable.Most of these centres were in southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Puducherry (IVT - 37 per cent EVT 35 per cent ) followed western states like such as Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (IVT – 29 per cent , EVT – 31 per cent ).The percentage of IVT and EVT capable centers in the northern region was 20 per cent and 18 per cent , respectively, while the central, east and north-east zones collectively accounted for only 13.5 per cent of IVT-capable facilities and 16 per cent of the EVT-capable facilities.The IJS study, led by Dr Kaiz S Asif from Chicago-based Ascension Health and Dr Arun Mitra from AIIMS Hyderabad, also found that the median distances to the nearest IVT capable and EVT capable centers were 115 km and 131 km respectively – with southern states having the shortest median distances and driving times and the north-eastern ones having the longest median distances and driving times.Dr Padma Srivastava, chairperson of neurology at Paras Health Gurugram, who was also part of the study, told TOI in developed countries like US, Canada and Germany, 90 per cent of the population can access stroke-ready centers in a short duration.“Our study shows the proportion of the total population that resides in population centers with a driving time of one hour to IVT-C and EVT-C centers is 26 per cent and 21 per cent , respectively. The states/UTs of Chandigarh, Kerala, and Delhi have the best coverage with over half of the population having to travel less than one hour, while states/UTs like Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, and north-eastern states have the least coverage,” she said and stressed on the need to bridge this gap.Dr Kameshwar Prasad, a top neurologist and former director of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, said delaying arrival of stroke patients certainly impacts the treatment outcome and having more stroke-ready centers was the need of hour.In addition to that, Dr Prasad said, a drive was needed to create awareness on how to recognise stroke symptoms, both among the public and the first-contact doctors. “I made RIMS stroke-ready, but it took one year to get a patient eligible for clot-dissolving medicine and use the same. Though in the city itself, in one year approx. 200 patients would have suffered ischemic (blockage type) of stroke. What it means is that providing stroke ready hospitals even in proximity would not result in eligible stroke patients receiving thrombolysis or thrombectomy, unless public and primary contact professionals are educated about stroke,” he added.","India sees nearly 1.5 million stroke cases every year of which nearly 85 to 90 per cent are caused by a clot in the major blood vessels of the brain.

Gift deed can be quashed if kids neglect parents: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gift-deed-can-be-quashed-if-kids-neglect-parents-sc/articleshow/116926192.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emphasising need to protect interests of senior citizens, many of whom are ignored by their children and left to fend for themselves once they hand over property by executing a gift deed , Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act if the children fail to take care of them. The transfer of property would be declared null and void, court said.A bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Karol said the Act is a beneficial legislation meant to lend a helping hand to elders who are left alone due to withering of joint family system and that its provisions should be interpreted liberally, and not in the strict sense, to protect their rights.It set aside a Madhya Pradesh HC verdict which held that gift deeds cannot be quashed on grounds of not serving parents if such conditions were not expressly mentioned in the deed. SC said HC took a 'strict view' of the legislation when a liberal view was needed to be taken to fulfil purpose of the law.Section 23 of the Act says, ""Where any senior citizen who, after the commencement of this Act, has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition that the transferee shall provide basic amenities and basic physical needs to the transferor and if such transferee refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, the said transfer of property shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or under undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor be declared void by the tribunal.""Referring to this, HC had held that a gift deed should have a clause to the effect to bind children to take care of parents, and the deed cannot be quashed in absence of it. But SC overruled the verdict.The court allowed a woman's plea for quashing the gift deed in favour of her son who refused to take care of her. It relied on ""avachan patra/promissory note"" executed by her son promising to take care of her till the end of her life and that if he does not do so, she will be at liberty to take back the deed. The note was executed on the same day of execution of the gift deed.""The Act is a beneficial piece of legislation, aimed at securing rights of senior citizens, in view of the challenges faced by them. It is in this backdrop that the Act must be interpreted and a construction that advances remedies of the Act must be adopted,"" SC said.","Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act.

The govt counsel said during lockdown, private unaided residential schools were collecting additional fees, including ""hostel fees, mess and laundry charges, horse-riding fees, development charges, and swimming charges"", even when these services were not availed by students. Chief standing counsel C S Rawat argued these schools had no grounds to charge such fees ""in the name of maintenance."" He said govt order explicitly allowed only tuition fees for online classes.Additional chief standing counsel P C Bisht argued that the govt acted as a custodian of public welfare to prevent private residential schools from exploiting their dominant position to burden parents financially. ""State was under constitutional duty to intervene to ensure that education of children does not suffer a setback due to financial crisis suffered by parents during the pandemic,"" he added.After hearing both sides, the court concluded that state govt was justified in exercising its powers under Article 162 of the Constitution to issue such directions. It added, ""In view of the emergent situation caused by the pandemic and the consequent lockdown, state was justified in issuing necessary directions to private unaided residential schools not to charge fees for services, which were not availed of by students during the period.""The court acknowledged that while the executive power of the state extends to matters within the legislature's purview, it is not without limits.

Justice Kant said, ""We are conscious of the sensitive issue. We must find some modality to translate the regulations into reality.""Jaising said under the 2012 regulations, every university was mandated to establish 'Equal Opportunity Cells' headed by an anti-discrimination officer. However, the majority of the 800-odd universities have not set up these equality cells. She also questioned the rationale behind a single officer heading these cells and suggested these cells be made multi-member bodies to include social activists and representatives from NGOs.The bench criticised the UGC for not notifying the draft regulations, which it had said was framed in 2023, till date and ordered that the new regulations must be notified without any delay and placed for consideration of the court.It also directed the UGC to collect data from all universities which have set up equality cells as per the requirement of the 2012 Regulations within six weeks and file an additional affidavit incorporating the same. The bench requested solicitor general Tushar Mehta to assist the court in the case.The bench said it learnt from the record that no effective hearing has taken place in the petition since issuance of notice to UGC by the SC on Sep 20, 2019.

Their arrest was facilitated by a lookout circular issued against them. The court has placed the arrested individuals in ED custody until Jan 8 following their production before the magistrate for regular remand.The ED's investigation stems from a police FIR against Malegaon businessman Siraj Ahmed Mohammad Harun Memon and his associates, who allegedly misused identity documents of innocent individuals to transfer illicit funds. Recently, the ED took Siraj Ahmed Mohammad Harun Memon, who was arrested by the police in the connected fraud case and was in jail, in its custody for interrogation and had conducted multiple searches in the case, and seized Rs 13.5 crore in tainted cash. The agency's investigation uncovered illicit proceeds exceeding Rs 900 crore, which were channelled through various shell companies operated by the accused.The ED said "" Mehmood Abdul Samad Bhagad , alias Challenger King"" is the mastermind behind the money laundering operation and he fled the country recently after the agency initiated its investigation.The ED said that both the arrested suspects posed a flight risk, evidenced by their departure from India following searches at premises of case suspects Harsh Kanubhai Baira of Haresh Trading and Hardikkumar Solanki of Hardik Enterprise which were used for layering of tainted money. In November, Baira and Solanki provided statements confirming they established two entities under Gaurang Ganpat Parmar's instructions and surrendered all banking documents to him.According to the ED, Parmar established these entities following instructions from Ritesh Shah.

The mission is slated for a Sept 2026 launch by Isro’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.

Engaging girls isn’t just closing a gap, it’s launching a universe of untapped talent,’’ she said.Last month, Chennai-based Space Kidz India (SKI) and IN-SPACEe signed an MOU for ShakthiSAT. The role of IN-SPACEe, set up by govt of India, is to facilitate private sector participation in India’s space programmes. SKI hit the headlines in 2017 when it launched the world’s tiniest satellite called KalamSat and won a Nasa competition.Based on the performance of the 12,000 girls, 108 — one from each country — will be chosen and brought to Chennai between Oct and Dec for familiarisation with Mission ShakthiSAT. They will also build payloads that will carry out different scientific experiments.Kesan said, “With unwavering determination, the mission sets out to extend a golden opportunity to 108 talented students from each country, to curate, build and launch a satellite to the lunar orbit.”For girls from African and Latin American countries, the age for joining the mission is between 14 and 18 years, and for the rest it’s 14-16 years.","Isro has brought together about 12,000 talented girls from 108 countries for an all-girls flight to the lunar orbit.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels remain in control of large parts of Yemen, including capital Sanaa.After the Yemen president last month upheld the death sentence of Nimisha, in jail since 2017, India said it was in touch with her family members and was extending all possible help to them in exploring legal options.Iran's offer of help came ahead of another round of foreign office consultations with India in which Tehran is expected to call for revival of trade ties, including resumption of oil supplies to India. Unlike with Iran, India has not just continued to import crude from Russia despite international sanctions but also ramped up Russian supplies.The official also spoke about bilateral ties with India and the need to explore opportunities to enhance trade ties, despite the sanctions Iran is facing.

The file was then sent to the PPSC for concurrence, as part of the laid-down procedure.The dismissal order on Thursday noted that the PPSC concurred with the proposal of the state govt on Dec 26 and granted approval to dismiss Sandhu from govt service under Article 311(2)(b) of the Constitution.The order pointed out that the proviso in question under the Article implemented in the present case as it was “not reasonably practicable” to hold an inquiry into the chargesheet issued to Gursher Singh Sandhu in view of the “non-cooperative attitude of the officer.”Referring to the inquiry by a special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the high court, the order said that Sandhu, who was under suspension since Oct 25, “facilitated the recording of an interview of Lawrence Bishnoi by a TV channel, while he was in the custody of CIA, Kharar.”The dismissal order noted that the Punjab DGP apprised that Sandhu “evaded all attempts to receive the chargesheet,” which had to be “affixed at the doorstep of his residence as a means of ensuring formal service in compliance with procedural requirements.”Two back-to-back TV interviews of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi were telecast by a channel in March 2023. The SIT headed by special DGP (Punjab State Human Rights Commission) Prabodh Kumar pointed out that while one interview was conducted when Bishnoi was in CIA, Kharar, the second interview was conducted in Rajasthan.Consequent to the SIT findings, seven police officials, including Sandhu, were suspended by the Punjab government.

The number game

'Chacha will be voted out'



NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said he was ready to ""forgive and welcome"" Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to the opposition INDIA boc.""Our doors are open (for Nitish). He should also unbolt his gates. This would facilitate movement of people from both sides,"" Lalu Yadav said.Reacting to the RJD chief's remark, CM Nitish Kumar gave no affirmative response.""Kya bol rahe hain (What are you saying)"" was all the JD(U) boss said in response to queries from journalists about Prasad's fresh offer, according to news agency PTI.Meanwhile, former JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh ""Lalan"" snapped when asked about Lalu Yadav's remark.""The NDA is strong. JD(U) and BJP are united. It is a free society and anybody can say whatever he pleases. It is for Lalu ji to say more on his own utterances"", Lalan Singh said.Nitish Kumar, who ditched the INDIA bloc after spearheading its formation last year, joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.With the switch, though Nitish managed to remain the CM, RJD leader and Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav had to step down as his deputy.Just hours after he resigned, the Janata Dal (United) chief took oath as the chief minister for a record ninth time.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also took a dig at Lalu Yadav, saying his ""dream will always remain dreams (Mungeri Lal ke Haseen Sapne hi rahenge). They will never be fulfilled.""Things seemed to fare smoothly for the NDA until the opposition got a shot in the arms after the Lok Sabha poll results.In the parliamentary election, BJP missed out on the majority numbers as it won only 240 seats, 32 less than the halfway mark.Whereas, the JDU won 12 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and emerged as a key ally in the NDA, positioning Nitish Kumar as a crucial player in the ruling alliance.The BJP-led NDA at the Centre majorly hinges on the JDU and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, which won 16 seats for the ruling coalition to cross the majority figure of the 272 seats.If the table turns in Bihar, the INDIA bloc with 235 seats, would have a direct advantage of an additional 12 seats, an opportunity that the opposition has been eying since June 4 results.Unlike his father, Tejaswi Yadav was a little hard-hitting with his remark as he claimed that the new year will mark the ""departure"" of the CM Nitish-led NDA government in Bihar.Tejashwi Yadav, who is now leader of the opposition, was talking to reporters shortly after governor designate Arif Mohammad Khan left his house in Patna.""It is too cold. Keep yourselves warm but do not make any wild guesses. The new year will see a new harvest (nai fasal) and a new government that will be sensitive to the people's need for health, education and jobs (padhaai, kamaai, dawaai, sunwai aur karvaayi ki sarkaar),"" the RJD leader was quoted as saying by PTI.He added: ""In the new year, my uncle (chacha) Nitish Kumar will be voted out. He has been in power for 20 years. Soil gets ruined if the same crop is sown for so long. So, it is time for the departure of Nitish ji and the NDA.""","Lalu Prasad Yadav says he is ready to ""forgive and welcome"" Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to the opposition INDIA boc.

Famous personality who underwent blood fusion from son

Influencer Marcela Iglesias , 47, who refers to herself as a "" human Barbie ,"" is reportedly planning to undergo a blood transfusion from her 23-year-old son, Rodrigo, in 2025, with the goal of reversing aging. Iglesias has allegedly spent nearly $100,000 on cosmetic procedures , focusing primarily on non-invasive injectables. She believes that transferring younger blood can rejuvenate cells, as reported by the Daily Mail.Marcela, originally from Argentina and residing in Hollywood for several decades, runs her own business. She calls herself a ""human Barbie"" and has previously shared that she spends $965 a month on wellness treatments, including IVs, injections, vitamins, and creams. She also posted a photo from her teenage years, showing that she has hardly aged in the past 30 years. In addition to these treatments, Marcela follows a strict routine and diet, avoiding soy products, alcohol, fizzy or sugary drinks, and maintaining a pescatarian diet. The influencer also ensures she exercises for at least an hour daily and gets eight hours of sleep each night, according to the Daily Mail.Marcela said, as quoted by a Daily Mail report, that blood transfusion is seen as the new method for maintaining young cells in the system, particularly when the blood comes from one's own son or daughter. She mentioned that after trying stem cell therapy, she began to explore more about healing from the inside out. She explained that there could be numerous benefits from the cells of a younger donor, especially if that donor is her own son.""Blood transfusion is the new era of maintaining young cells in your system especially when it comes from your own son or daughter,"" Marcela said.""Since I tried stem cell therapy I started to dig more into healing from the inside out.""""There can be many benefits from the cells of a younger donor, especially if the donor is my own son.""Apparently, Marcela's son is not only sharing his blood with her but is also undergoing a transfusion with his 75-year-old grandmother, Graciela. The influencer plans to undergo the procedure in early 2025 and is currently looking for a doctor in her area to perform the treatment for both herself and her mother.""I'm currently searching for a doctor that will perform the treatment in Los Angeles,"" she said.Marcela elaborated on the benefits, saying that blood transfusions provide fresh red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body, while plasma contains proteins and clotting factors that help with bleeding and healing. She added that she has been told the body embraces this boost, comparing it to a traveler being refreshed by a sip of water after a long journey.""Blood transfusions bring fresh red blood cells to carry oxygen through your body. Plasma carries proteins and clotting factors, perfect for helping with bleeding or healing. I have been told that your body welcomes this boost like a traveler quenched by a sip of water after a long journey,"" she added.In the end, Marcela expects to feel stronger, steadier, and more supported.When the idea of blood transfusion was introduced to Marcela's son Rodrigo, she mentioned he was more than happy to be a part of her mission to stay young forever. Marcela shared that Rodrigo is fully aware of how the procedure works and its benefits.""Rodrigo is very aware of how the procedure is performed and all the benefits of it. He is willing to go through with it. He is excited about the idea of helping his grandmother, too,"" said Marcela, as quoted by a Daily Mail report.Regarding the transfusion, Marcela described it as more than just a procedure; she referred to it as a gift shared during a quiet moment of healing in one's personal story.'It's not just a procedure – it's a gift shared by a quiet moment of healing in your own personal story,"" she said.Marcela mentioned that she is uncertain whether she would require multiple sessions, as it would depend on the outcome of the first session and how she and her mother feel afterward.Marcela also reflected on people's reactions when they learned she had a 23-year-old son, noting that many would say she is too young to be a mother. She commented that people often ask her how she stays looking so youthful, and she confessed that while treatments can help, sometimes plastic surgery is the only solution.""When people find out I have a 23-year-old son, they say I am far too young to be a mum.""'People constantly ask me what I do to stay looking so young. I have to tell them the truth – even though they may do all the treatments that I have done, sometimes plastic surgery is the only solution.""Marcela expressed that it feels great to have her efforts recognized and stressed that everything one puts into their body reflects on the outside, making it essential to take care of both the inside and outside.'It feels great that people recognize the work that I have put in.""'Everything that you put in your body will reflect on the outside so it's very important to treat the inside as well as you can, too.'In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about using plasma from young donors as a treatment. The agency explained that “using plasma from young donors has not gone through rigorous testing that the FDA normally requires in order to confirm the therapeutic benefit of a product and to ensure its safety.” “As a result, the reported uses of these products should not be assumed to be safe or effective,"" it cautioned.Bryan Johnson, an American entrepreneur known for his anti-aging efforts, recently received a blood plasma transfusion from his 17-year-old son, Talmage, and his 70-year-old father, Richard. The procedure took place at a Dallas clinic. A liter of blood was drawn from both the son and father. A machine separated the blood into plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Johnson then received the components from his son and father’s blood. The goal of the transfusion was to reverse aging by replacing older blood with younger blood.Johnson has spent millions of dollars attempting to slow down or reverse the aging process. He claims to have reduced his biological age by more than five years in two years and to have the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old, and the lung capacity and fitness of an 18-year-old.","Marcela Iglesias, 47, is reportedly planning to undergo a blood transfusion from her 23-year-old son, Rodrigo, in 2025.

Janel Grant Poised to Shake WWE with Lawsuit Amendment Against Vince McMahon and John Laurinaitis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/janel-grant-poised-to-shake-wwe-with-lawsuit-amendment-against-vince-mcmahon-and-john-laurinaitis/articleshow/116917525.cms,"Credits: WWE and NewsNation

Janel Grant Prepares Major Legal Update Against Vince McMahon and John Laurinaitis

Janel Grant, a former employee of WWE, intends to amend her initial lawsuit, which she filed last January alleging sex trafficking and graphic sexual assault against Vince McMahon , former WWE Head of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis, and WWE itself. The lawsuit was filed almost a year ago. Brandon Thurston of Post Wrestling broke the story on Thursday, citing fresh court documents. According to Thurston, it's unclear what modifications Grant intends to make to her amended complaint.Grant's initial 67-page complaint included gruesome accusations, such as that McMahon and Laurinaitis were sexually assaulted and that McMahon was involved in sex trafficking. Brock Lesnar was also named in connection with alleged sexual encounters that occurred during the renegotiation of his WWE talent contract. Additionally, the lawsuit claims that former executives Brad Blum, Stephanie McMahon , Brian Nurse, and WWE President Nick Khan knew about McMahon's actions, which could put WWE at fault. However, prior to Grant filing the lawsuit, WWE claimed that Khan was unaware of the accusations.Grant filed a lawsuit against Dr. Carlon Colker and his Peak Wellness clinic in Connecticut during the summer while the federal case was pending. She claimed that McMahon repeatedly sent her to the clinic for infusions and supplements without providing a clear explanation. Grant requested that Colker and his clinic release her medical records as part of this case.Citing an arbitration clause in the nondisclosure agreement McMahon and Grant signed in January 2022, the defendants in Grant's lawsuit are attempting to have the case transferred to private arbitration.Grant is allowed to make one amendment to her complaint without the court's consent under federal court rules. Email exhibits from Ann Callis were included in a filing that Grant's legal team sent to the defense on January 2, 2025. These emails, which were sent on December 16, 2024, suggested a timeline for further filings and advised the defense of Grant's intention to revise her complaint by January 15, 2025. Grant's lawyers have asked the court to lift the stay and establish due dates for upcoming filings, or they have asked for a status conference to discuss the timeline.ALSO READ: Triple H and Stephanie McMahon Join Linda McMahon at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago The ongoing drama surrounding the company and its former leadership is made more complex by the allegations against McMahon and WWE being clarified by this legal battle.What do you think about Janel Grant amending the lawsuit against Vince McMahon and John Laurinaitis?
