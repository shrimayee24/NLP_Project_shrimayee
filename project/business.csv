The CJI said Ambedkar had said the Indian Constitution was one of the best in the world and had exuded confidence that it would keep the country strong during peace as well as war. tnn",A five-judge bench of Supreme Court led by CJI B R Gavai repelled suggestions that the Constitution should not lean too much towards the Centre.

"Since 1970, governors cleared 94% of over 17k bills, withheld assent to only 20: Centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/since-1970-governors-cleared-94-of-over-17k-bills-withheld-assent-to-only-20-centre/articleshow/123821470.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday defended the constitutional scheme conferring discretion on governors on bills, and said for the last 55 years it has worked smoothly with the heads of states assenting to 94% of over 17,000 bills presented to them and withholding assent only to 20 bills.Presenting statistics on bills presented to governors since 1970 and the decisions taken on them, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that in 84% of the bills, the governors had granted assent within one month of receiving the bills, which indicates that the constitutional scheme has worked irrespective of the political parties governing at the Centre and the states.It is only a few states who have decided to rush to Supreme Court in the last few years to attempt solutions through judicial adjudication, rather than resorting to the tried and tested political mechanism which for more than five decades had been able to resolve the differences between the state govts and the governors.He said of the 17,150 bills presented to governors between 1970 and 2025, 16,122 were assented to, of which 14,402 bills (84%) received governors' assent within a month of the heads of the states receiving them.The statistics indicated the trend to be true even for TN, where an overwhelming majority of the bills received assent from governor within a month.Presentation of the data by the SG invited protests from senior advocates Kapil Sibal (for Bengal) and A M Singhvi (for TN), who said the court did not allow them to present statistics about inordinate delays on part of governors to take a decision on the bills, some extending to years. The bench agreed and stopped SG from relying on the statistics.CJI Gavai said, ""We didn't allow them to rely on statistics about delay on bills caused by individual governors. We will only answer the questions referred to us by the President based on interpretation of the constitutional provisions.""Mehta said individual aberrations by governors in delaying decisions on bills cannot be a reason for the court to enter the forbidden territory on amendment of constitutional provisions, which fall within the exclusive domain of Parliament.Appearing for DMK, senior advocate P Wilson said TN has suffered the most because of the unconstitutional delay resulting from the inaction of the ornamental head of state in the governor. He said, ""A bill born in assembly cannot be killed in Raj Bhawan.""","The Centre on Wednesday defended the constitutional scheme conferring discretion on governors on bills.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament

Poll Do you think young leaders like Balen Shah can bring positive change in Nepal? Yes, he can make a difference No, experience matters more

Balen's message for Nepali youth





With Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepping down amid the deadly student-led “GenZ protests,” attention has shifted to Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, as online campaigns promote him as the Himalayan nation’s next leader.Popularly known as “Balen,” the 35-year-old is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022. He won as an independent candidate, becoming the first to hold the post without party backing.An engineer by training, Balen holds a degree in civil engineering and has an India connection - he pursued structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in Karnataka. Before entering politics, he was active in Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to highlight corruption and inequality.In June 2023, he drew national attention by banning the screening of Indian films in Kathmandu over a dialogue in the movie Adipurush.In a Facebook post, Shah on Tuesday appealed to protesters to exercise restraint, noting that their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and other ministers has already been met.He cautioned against further damage to public and private property, saying, “The loss of the country’s wealth is, in reality, a loss of our own property. It is now essential that we all act with restraint.”Shah’s appeal comes as nationwide “GenZ” protests intensify, with young demonstrators demanding accountability over corruption, restrictions on freedoms and police violence. A security forces crackdown has left at least 19 dead and more than 500 injured in clashes around the Federal Parliament and other parts of Kathmandu over the past two days.","Balendra Shah, 35, is a rapper-turned-politician who has served as Kathmandu’s 15th mayor since May 2022.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas.

'One Who Fools People The Best Can Be The Best Leader': Nitin Gadkari's Leadership 'Truth' Shocker

NEW DELHI: Days after the Supreme Court rejected a PIL challenging the nationwide rollout of 20% ethanol-blended (E20) petrol, road transport & highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday blamed the “petrol lobby” and other “interests” behind the social media stories against blending.""Everywhere there are lobbies, there are interests... petrol lobby is very rich,"" he said when asked about the spate of social media posts where consumers could be seen complaining about the reduction of mileage and damage to the engines of older vehicles due to the E20 fuel.Speaking at the Auto Retail Conclave organized by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), Gadkari said that ethanol—produced from sugarcane, broken rice, and other agricultural products—is expected to help reduce India's dependence on foreign oil.The country is spending Rs 22 lakh crore for importing fossil fuels, which are also leading to ""problems of pollution"" across cities, the minister added.He said companies are manufacturing electric cars, buses, and trucks in India as they are very cost-effective. ""The cost of lithium-ion batteries is also reducing. In due course of time, the price of petrol, diesel, and electric vehicles will be the same.""The minister also said the manufacturing capacity of electric buses in India is 50,000-60,000 units per year, against a requirement for nearly one lakh units annually.""We need to increase the production of electric buses... There is a huge market for exports also. This is the opportunity for electric vehicle companies.""The minister also said the transport ministry is working to encourage the use of flex-fuel engines in agricultural equipment vehicles.On the growth potential of the passenger vehicle market, he said the government aims to make the Indian market the top seller in the world within five years.""Within five years, our target is to make India's automobile industry number 1 in the world... it is difficult, but not impossible,"" he said, adding that the quality of vehicles manufactured in India is good while production costs are low compared to other countries.""When I took charge as transport minister, the size of the Indian automobile industry was Rs 14 lakh crore. The size now is Rs 22 lakh crore,"" Gadkari said, adding that at Rs 78 lakh crore, the US is the biggest market globally, followed by China (Rs 47 lakh crore).","Road transport & highways minister Nitin Gadkari blamed the “petrol lobby’ and other “interests” behind the social media stories against blending.

"Concept of ‘brain-dead’ unscientific, says petitioner: SC struggles to understand medical jargon, adjourns hearing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concept-of-brain-dead-unscientific-says-petitioner-sc-struggles-to-understand-medical-jargon-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/123776993.cms,"Poll Should the Supreme Court have the authority to influence changes to laws regarding brain-death definitions? Yes, they should have that authority. No, it violates separation of powers.

NEW DELHI: Attuned to understand the legal jargons, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday found it difficult to digest the medical terminology saturated arguments of a doctor who challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994.Appealing against a Kerala HC judgment, Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. He said Sections 2(d) and 2(e) THOTA, relatable to brain death, are unconstitutional.Section 2(d) provided the meaning of ‘brain-stem-death’ as a stage when all functions of the brainstem have ceased permanently and irreversibly. Sec 2(e) provided that ‘deceased person’ means a person in whom permanent disappearance of all evidence of life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in a cardio-pulmonary sense, at any time after live birth has taken place.As he continued to explain brain-stem death, and its different meanings in different countries, Justice Kant-led bench said, “It is almost impossible for us to understand the medical terminologies you use. Why don’t you make a presentation on this before the National Medical Commission or experts from the health ministry?”“Ultimately, even if the court or the authorities accept your definition of bran-death, ultimately it would require the government to move a Bill in Parliament to amend the law.Can SC direct Parliament to amend a law? Will it not violate the Constitution-mandated separation of power,” the bench asked.Dr Ganapathy said organ transplant is the biggest business in India and only the poor patients are declared brain-dead to enable harvesting of the organs for other rich patients. “Why is it that hospitals declare only poor patients as brain-dead and not the kin of a SC judge, advocate or a rich and influential person,” he asked.The bench said, “If Parliament chose a definition of brain-death, the courts must accept it. We will not be able to change it even as the Supreme Court. You may argue that the brain-death definition given in the law is incomplete, but it is not an incorrect one.”When the court was about to dispose of the appeal, Dr Ganapathy said his earlier petition, challenging another order of the Kerala HC asking him to approach appropriate authority regarding malpractice in hospitals in declaring a person brain-dead, is pending since 2018 and requested that the present appeal be tagged with that one. SC gladly agreed to escape the medical jargon.","Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.

Bhagwat ji's tenure will be considered most transformative period in RSS' 100-year journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwat-jis-tenure-will-be-considered-most-transformative-period-in-rss-100-yr-journey/articleshow/123820021.cms,"RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

(The author is Prime Minister of India)

Today is Sept 11. This day evokes two contrasting remembrances. The first dates back to 1893, when Swami Vivekananda delivered his iconic Chicago address. With the few words, ""Sisters and Brothers of America,"" he won the hearts of thousands present in the hall. He introduced the timeless spiritual heritage of India and the emphasis on universal brotherhood to the world stage. The second is the gruesome 9/11 attacks, when this very principle came under attack thanks to the menace of terrorism and radicalism.There is something else about this day which is noteworthy. Today is the birthday of a personality who, inspired by the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, has dedicated his entire life to societal transformation and strengthening the spirit of harmony and fraternity. For lakhs of people associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, he is respectfully referred to as Param Pujya Sarsanghchalak. Yes, I am referring to Shri Mohan Bhagwat ji, whose 75th birthday is, incidentally, falling in the same year when the RSS marks its centenary. I would like to convey my best wishes to him and pray for his long and healthy life.My association with Mohan ji's family has been very deep. I have had the good fortune of working closely with Mohan ji's father, the late Madhukarrao Bhagwat ji. I have written extensively about him in my book, Jyotipunj. Along with his association with the legal world, he devoted himself to nation-building. He played a pivotal role in strengthening the RSS across Gujarat. Such was Madhukarrao ji's passion towards nation-building that it groomed his son, Mohanrao, to work towards India's regeneration.It is as if Parasmani Madhukarrao prepared another Parasmani in Mohanrao.Mohan ji became a pracharak in the mid-1970s. Upon hearing the word 'pracharak', one may mistakenly think it refers to someone who is simply doing prachar or campaigning, propagating ideas. But, those familiar with the working of the RSS understand that the pracharak tradition is at the core of the organisation's work. Over the last hundred years, thousands of young people, inspired by a patriotic zeal, have left their homes and families to dedicate their lives to realising the mission of India First.His early years in the RSS coincided with a very dark period of Indian history. This was the time the draconian Emergency was imposed by the then Congress govt. For every person who cherished democratic principles and wanted India to prosper, it was natural to strengthen the anti-Emergency movement. This is exactly what Mohan ji and countless RSS swayamsevaks did. He worked extensively in rural and backward areas of Maharashtra, especially Vidarbha. This shaped his understanding of the challenges faced by the poor and downtrodden.Over the years, Bhagwat ji held various positions in the RSS. He performed each and every one of those duties with great dexterity. Mohan ji's years as the head of the Akhil Bharatiya Sharirik Pramukh during the 1990s are still fondly remembered by many swayamsevaks. During this period, he spent considerable time working in the villages of Bihar. These experiences further deepened his connect with grassroots issues. In 2000, he became the sarkaryawah and here too, he brought his unique way of working, handling the most complex of situations with ease and precision. In 2009, he became the sarsanghchalak and continues to work with great vibrancy.Being sarsanghchalak is more than an organisational responsibility. Extraordinary individuals have defined this role through personal sacrifice, clarity of purpose and unshakable commitment to Maa Bharti. Mohan ji, in addition to doing full justice to the enormity of the responsibility, has also brought to it his own strength, intellectual depth and empathetic leadership, all of which is inspired by the principle of Nation First.If I can think of two attributes Mohan ji has held close to his heart and imbibed in his work style, they are continuity and adaptation. He has always steered the Organisation through very complex currents, never compromising on the core ideology we are all proud of and at the same time addressing the evolving needs of society. He has a natural connect with the youth and thus, has always focused on integrating more youngsters with the Sangh Parivar. He is often seen engaging in public discourse and interacting with people, which has been very beneficial in today's dynamic and digital world.Broadly speaking, Bhagwat ji's tenure will be considered the most transformative period in the 100-year journey of the RSS. From the change in uniform to the modifications in the shiksha vargs (training camps), several significant changes occurred under his leadership.I particularly remember Mohan ji's efforts during the Covid period, when humanity battled a once in a lifetime pandemic. In those times, continuing the traditional RSS activities became challenging. Mohan ji suggested increased usage of technology. In the context of the global challenges, he remained connected with global perspectives while developing institutional frameworks.At that time, all swayamsevaks made every possible effort to reach out to those in need, while ensuring the safety of themselves and others. Medical camps were organised in several places. We also lost many of our hardworking swayamsevaks, but such was the inspiration of Mohan ji that their determination never wavered.Earlier this year, during the inauguration of the Madhav Netra Chikitsalaya in Nagpur, I had remarked that the RSS is like an Akshayavat, an eternal banyan tree that energises the national culture and collective consciousness of our nation.The roots of this Akshayavat are deep and strong because they are anchored in values. The dedication with which Mohan Bhagwat ji has committed himself to nurturing and advancing these values is truly inspirational.Another admirable quality of Mohan ji's personality is his soft-spoken nature. He is blessed with an exceptional ability to listen. This trait ensures a deeper perspective and also brings a sense of sensitivity and dignity to his persona and leadership.Here, I also want to write about the keen interest he has always shown towards various mass movements. From Swachh Bharat Mission to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, he always urges the entire RSS family to add vigour through these movements. In order to further social well-being, Mohan ji has given the 'Panch Parivartan', which includes social harmony, family values, environmental awareness, national selfhood and civic duties. These can inspire Indians from all walks of life. Every swayamsevak dreams of seeing a strong and prosperous nation. To realise this dream, what is required is both clear vision and decisive action. Mohan ji embodies both these qualities in abundance.Bhagwat ji has always been a strong votary of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat', a firm believer in India's diversity and the celebration of so many different cultures and traditions that are a part of our land.Beyond his busy schedule, Mohan ji has always found time to pursue passions like music and singing. Few people know that he is very versatile in various Indian musical instruments. His passion for reading can be seen in several of his speeches and interactions.This year, in a few days from now, the RSS turns 100. It is also a pleasant coincidence that this year, Vijaya Dashami , Gandhi Jayanti, Lal Bahadur Shastri Jayanti and the RSS centenary celebrations are on the same day. It will be a historic milestone for lakhs of people associated with the RSS in India and the world. And, we have a very wise and hardworking sarsanghchalak in Mohan ji, steering the organisation in these times. I will conclude by saying that Mohan ji is a living example of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, showing that when we rise above boundaries and consider everyone as our own, it strengthens trust, brotherhood and equality in society. I once again wish Mohan ji a long and healthy life in service of Maa Bharti.","Prime Minister: Mohan Bhagwat has dedicated his entire life to societal transformation. Mohan ji became a pracharak in the mid-1970s. He worked extensively in rural and backward areas of Maharashtra, especially Vidarbha. He played a pivotal role in strengthening the RSS across Gujarat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123820066,imgsize-41604,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the late Sunjay Kapur's wife, Priya, to disclose all his assets, both movable and immovable.HC was hearing a suit filed by the two children from Kapur's former wife, Karisma Kapoor, asserting their claim to a share in their father's personal estate.Priya informed the court that the two children had already received Rs 1,900 crore in assets from the family trust, and asked, ""What more do they want?""Justice Jyoti Singh registered the plaint by Samaira Kapoor, 20, and 15-year-old minor son also challenging the purported will of their late father and issued notice to Priya, posting the matter for Oct 9.Appearing for Priya, senior advocate Rajiv Nayyar contested the claim that his client forged the will to gain control over all assets. When the high court queried if the will was registered, Nayyar replied it wasn't but was valid.""It's not registered. Unregistered does not take the nature away.

Governors can't sit over bills indefinitely: Centre in SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/governors-cant-sit-over-bills-indefinitely-centre-in-sc/articleshow/123818771.cms,"Bihar SIR: SC Slams Political Parties’ Silence, Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 Documents

NEW DELHI: Centre on Wednesday agreed with opposition-led states that governors cannot sit over a bill indefinitely but argued before the Supreme Court that the Constitution had vested in them the discretion to decide whether to grant or withhold assent to legislation, return it with suggestions to the assembly or reserve it for the President's consideration.Responding to opposition-led states' insistence that a governor, being just an ornamental head, cannot choose any of the options without the aid and advice of the council of ministers, solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta said a wrong political canvas has been presented in court to persuade it to transgress Parliament's domain and amend constitutional provisions related to governors' powers to make them rubber stamps at the hands of state govts.While Parliament may amend the Constitution under Article 368 (subject to the basic structure), the judiciary's role is confined to interpretation. If courts were to expand the meaning of a provision beyond its textual or structural limits, it would confer upon the judiciary a power equivalent to Parliament, a result not envisaged by the framers (of the Constitution). Such a course would be contrary to the constitutional scheme,"" Mehta told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar.After nine days of a riveting constitutional debate on the state-governor spat over bills, the SC's April 8 decision fixing timelines for governors and the President, followed by a Presidential Reference flagging powers of the apex court, Mehta said the Centre agreed with Kerala govt that a governor and a state govt should work collaboratively through consultati-on, with the former acting as a friend, philosopher and guide for the council of ministers.He added that the SC was not the headmaster of polity to address every conceivable issue raised by states which primarily belong to the political arena and which could be resolved through consultation among the PM, CM and ministers with the governor, or the President.This has been the practice in Indian polity because of which democracy has grown stronger and the constitutional provisions, including their interpretations by SC, are followed scrupulously. He said since 1970, governors of states had been presented with 17,150 bills, of which assent was withheld in only 20 bills.He said 933 bills had been reserved for President's consideration by governors, who granted assent to 16,122 (94%) of the bills - 14,402 of the nods coming within a month, 623 within three months, 126 in six months and the rest thereafter.Paying tribute to the framers of the Constitution for giving the governor the right to withhold assent to a bill, something termed by opposition-led states as subversion of the will of the people expressed through legislature, Mehta cited the example of the bill that the Punjab assembly passed in 2004 to terminate its water-sharing agreement with Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Should the governor, whom some states term a mere rubber stamp at the hands of the council of ministers, have granted assent to such a bill that would have adversely impacted inter-state, federal and India-Pakistan relations, the SG asked.The governor reserved this bill for consideration of the President, who, in turn, sent a reference seeking SC's opinion on the legality of unilateral annulment of water-sharing agreements, he said, adding that in his view governors in such situations are entitled to withhold assent to protect the constitutional scheme of quasi-federal governance. Arguments will conclude Thursday.",Centre agrees with opposition-led states that governors cannot sit over a bill indefinitely. Centre says Constitution vested in them discretion to decide whether to grant or withhold assent to legislation.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's last two posts on X responding to US President Donald Trump's comments are being watched as much for what they omit - any mention of his personal friendship with the American president - as for what they contain.On Saturday and again early Wednesday, Trump on Truth Social referred to his ""good friend"" Modi, the latest post mentioning continuing talks on reducing trade barriers. But the PM's responses stressed India-US ties, an indication, according to sources, that trade talks will be ""business-like,"" with India sticking to its red lines - including a refusal to slash import duties on agricultural and dairy products and an assertion of its sovereign right to decide purchases of commodities, especially crude petroleum.While the govt acknowledges the crucial role of relations with the US and the impact that the 50% tariffs will have on some businesses, it is also clear that any trade deal has to be on mutually beneficial terms. India is keen on building safeguards into the agreement for vulnerable groups such as small farmers. In addition, there will be no compromise on health concerns (read GM food) or cultural issues (such as cattle feed containing animal parts), sources reiterated.Officials suggested the govt will tread cautiously given the unpredictability of talks with the Trump administration, where the president decides everything and secretaries - however voluble - are largely limited to presenting the state of play.Multiple sources told TOI that negotiations for a bilateral trade deal were on track until Trump waded in with demands difficult for India to accept. Significant concessions had already been offered, including tariff reductions and commitments to purchase more American products such as oil and gas, to address DC's concerns over the ""large"" trade surplus.Officials here are also wary of the pressure Trump has brought upon himself by boasting he could restore peace between Russia and Ukraine. Having failed to deliver, he has looked for alternative targets like India to distract attention, sources said. With the European conflict increasingly intractable, the risk of US policy veering unpredictably will continue to lurk.Trump's calculation was that India would eventually fall in line, as Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and even the EU had done. But New Delhi was angered by his repeated claims of mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan despite Modi's categorical rebuttals. This hardened resistance to further concessions in sensitive areas.The govt, however, has not abandoned hopes of clinching a deal by the Fall, with the commerce minister recently mentioning Nov as a possible timeline. At the same time, it has refrained from escalating matters by retaliating against the ""secondary tariffs"" of 25% imposed on Indian exports to the US. Instead, India is focusing on widening market access elsewhere through trade pacts and boosting exports of products such as seafood to Europe and the UAE.","PM Narendra Modi's last two posts on X responding to US President Donald Trump's comments are being watched as much for what they omit.

Beating Elon Musk and other billionaires

Ellison’s investments beyond Oracle

Life and legacy of Larry Ellison

Family and personal interests





“When people start telling you that you’re crazy, you just might be on to the most important innovation in your life,” Larry Ellison said in 2016. Fast forward to 2025, he is at the most important position in the billionaires’ world—the richest man on Earth with a staggering net worth of $393 billion. The 81-year-old Oracle cofounder dethroned Elon Musk after Oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive AI-driven cloud contracts, propelling his wealth by an unprecedented $101 billion overnight. As of September 10, 2025, Ellison’s fortune stands at an astonishing $393 billion, placing him at the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977, then known as Software Development Laboratories. The company quickly rose to prominence with Oracle Version 2 (1979), the first commercially available SQL-based relational database management system (RDBMS). This innovation secured Oracle’s leadership in enterprise database technology through the 1980s and 1990s.Under Ellison’s leadership, Oracle became the world’s largest database management company by 1987 and went public in 1986. The company expanded aggressively, acquiring PeopleSoft in 2005, Sun Microsystems in 2010, and NetSuite in 2016, moves that cemented Oracle’s presence in enterprise applications, hardware, and cloud infrastructure.Ellison’s vision transformed Oracle from a startup into a $40 billion-plus software powerhouse.In the 2020s, Oracle pivoted strongly into artificial intelligence and cloud services, becoming a key provider for AI companies hungry for computing power. As CTO and executive chairman, Ellison drove the development of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), purpose-built for AI workloads with custom networking and chips. In 2025, Oracle unveiled its $500 billion Stargate initiative to build global AI infrastructure and industry-specific platforms, making it a central force in AI inference, a multi-trillion-dollar emerging market.The launch of Oracle’s AI Database, integrating enterprise data with models like ChatGPT, reinforced its dominance. By unifying hardware, software, and cloud services under one roof, Oracle reduced latency and costs, setting itself apart from rivals. These innovations have powered Oracle’s stock to double in 2025, sending Ellison’s fortune soaring.Ellison’s net worth of $393 billion pushed him past Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose wealth fell to $385 billion as Tesla’s shares slid 13% this year and its U.S. market share dropped to its lowest since 2017. Ellison also overtook Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who previously held the second-richest spot. Musk, who first claimed the title in 2021 before losing it to Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault, reclaimed the crown in 2024 and held it for nearly 300 days. Ellison’s ascent marks the first time he has reached the very top, reshaping the billionaire rivalry in Silicon Valley.Beyond Oracle, Ellison has built a diverse portfolio. In August 2025, he acquired nearly 50% of Paramount Skydance, the $28 billion media giant formed through the merger of Paramount and his son David’s Skydance. He also served on Tesla’s board from 2018 to 2022 and was a significant shareholder during his tenure. These ventures highlight Ellison’s strategy of combining core technology investments with cultural influence, extending his impact beyond the enterprise software world.Born in 1944, Ellison dropped out of both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago before beginning his career building databases for the CIA. He went on to lead Oracle for 37 years as CEO before stepping down in 2014 to become executive chairman and CTO. Known for his bold personality and risk-taking approach, Ellison has left an indelible mark on the software and cloud industry. In 2012, he bought nearly the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million, later moving there permanently in 2020. His career reflects both persistence and a willingness to defy convention.Ellison has four children, two of whom—Megan and David—are influential Hollywood producers. Megan Ellison financed critically acclaimed films like Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle, while David produced mainstream blockbusters such as The Terminator and Mission: Impossible. Outside business, Ellison is a passionate sailor and maintains a relatively private lifestyle despite his immense fortune. His limited philanthropy score contrasts with his reputation as one of Silicon Valley’s most daring entrepreneurs.With Oracle’s AI-powered rise and his net worth surpassing $393 billion, Ellison has proven that vision and persistence can outlast rivals. Today, at 81, he is not only the richest man alive but also one of the most influential figures shaping the future of technology.","Ellison dethroned Elon Musk after Oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive AI-driven cloud contracts.

He accused protesters of trying to create “a climate of insurrection.”The Macron government had deployed an exceptional 80,000 police officers across the country in an attempt to prevent large-scale disorder. Despite this, protesters erected barricades, lit fires and staged demonstrations across multiple regions. Garbage bins were set alight in Paris, while commuters reported blockages on key thoroughfares.Authorities said that 75 people had been detained in the capital by 9 am local time, but the arrests rose steadily throughout the day as unrest spread. By afternoon, police confirmed nearly 200 detentions nationwide.Although the “Block Everything” movement did not fully achieve its declared aim of paralyzing the country, it created major flashpoints that disrupted transport, work commutes and daily life.The protests erupted after a week of political turmoil in France. On Monday, Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a parliamentary confidence vote following his announcement of sweeping austerity measures, which included cutting public holidays and freezing pensions. Bayrou resigned shortly after the defeat.President Emmanuel Macron moved quickly, appointing Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu as the new prime minister on Tuesday — the fourth person to hold the post in just 12 months. The rapid turnover at the top highlighted France’s political instability and fuelled public frustration, with critics accusing Macron of ignoring widespread discontent.Unions and protest leaders said Bayrou’s resignation did little to ease their concerns. “The fall of the government is good, but it's insufficient,” rail union Sud-Rail posted on X.France’s political crisis is unfolding against a backdrop of worsening public finances. Macron has now appointed his fourth prime minister in a year, while the country grapples with a ballooning deficit, rising borrowing costs, and a parliament incapable of agreeing on spending reforms.France has not balanced its budget since 1973, sustaining an expansive welfare state through steady growth and cheap borrowing. Macron, first as economy minister and later as president, pushed reforms such as tax cuts, spending adjustments, and raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.But debt had already been high — over 90% of GDP since 2008. The pandemic and Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine made things worse. France spent heavily on subsidies to protect households and businesses, while interest rates rose sharply worldwide. Debt surged from 98% of GDP in 2019 to 114% in 2020, where it remains. The deficit reached 5.8% last year, far above the EU’s 3% threshold.Macron’s decision to call new elections after his party’s poor showing in the European parliament vote further destabilised the government. The new National Assembly has been fractured between a leftist bloc, Marine Le Pen’s nationalist party, and centrists — united mainly in their rejection of austerity.This gridlock toppled three prime ministers in quick succession — Gabriel Attal, Michel Barnier, and most recently François Bayrou — after attempts to rein in spending.France has one of the highest tax burdens in the EU at 43.8% of GDP, matched by equally high spending on pensions, civil servant wages, and defence. Rising interest rates have pushed annual interest payments on debt to €67 billion — funds no longer available for schools, healthcare, or welfare.Economists say France will need to enact tax hikes and spending cuts worth about 5% of GDP in the coming years to restore stability. That’s possible — Greece undertook even harsher measures during its debt crisis — but politically daunting.Bayrou’s failed austerity plan, which proposed cutting €44 billion and scrapping two public holidays, underscored parliament’s resistance.The “Bloquons Tout” or “Block Everything” movement began over the summer, gaining momentum online through TikTok, X and encrypted messaging channels. Its calls for strikes, boycotts and street protests resonated with workers, students and activists who felt Macron’s policies deepened inequality.The movement has no central leadership, which analysts say makes it unpredictable but also harder to suppress. While many posts called for peaceful action, authorities fear its decentralised nature allows for flash violence, as seen in clashes with police and property damage on Wednesday.The campaign’s tactics — from blocking roads to withdrawing money from banks and boycotting corporations such as Amazon and Carrefour — are reminiscent of the 2018–2019 “Yellow Vest” protests. Those demonstrations, triggered by fuel tax hikes, quickly snowballed into a broader anti-Macron movement.The protests and strikes created severe disruption for travellers across France. Rail and air traffic faced interruptions, though authorities insisted that most metro, tram and high-speed TGV services would run normally.The RER B line, linking central Paris to Charles de Gaulle Airport, was disrupted, forcing passengers to rely on shuttle buses and taxis. Sud Aérien, a union representing airline staff, maintenance workers and ground agents, urged members to strike and called for a rally at Charles de Gaulle Airport.The Civil Aviation Authority issued warnings for travellers at airports in Nice, Marseille, Bastia, Ajaccio and other cities, urging passengers to check with airlines for possible delays and cancellations.While RATP, which manages Paris’s public transit, said metro and bus services were “almost normal,” authorities admitted that blockages by demonstrators could cause unpredictable delays. Eurostar said cross-Channel services would run but advised passengers to allow extra time for connections.The timing of the protests, just a day after Lecornu’s appointment, has intensified the political challenge for Macron. Opposition parties accused the president of ignoring voter frustration by choosing another loyalist.“He is running the risk of legitimate social unrest and institutional gridlock in the country,” the Socialist Party said in a statement.Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed, dismissed Macron’s appointment of Lecornu as a provocation. “Only the departure of Macron himself can put an end to this sad comedy of contempt for Parliament, voters and political decency,” he wrote on social media.Jordan Bardella, leader of the far-right National Rally, also criticised the president. “Emmanuel Macron's motto: you don't change a losing team,” Bardella posted online.Lecornu, 39, becomes Macron’s fifth prime minister in his second term and the third in little over a year. Bayrou lasted just nine months before losing the confidence vote, while his predecessor survived barely three.Macron’s choice of Lecornu was seen as a move to maintain stability and avoid a dangerous power vacuum ahead of the protests. The president’s office said Lecornu had been tasked with seeking consensus in parliament to pass the budget, a critical priority as France faces ballooning public debt.Lecornu promised to focus on “the defense of our independence and of our power, service to the French people, and political and institutional stability for the unity of the country.”But analysts warn that with parliament deeply fractured between left-wing coalitions, centrists and the far right, Lecornu may face the same fate as his predecessors.At the heart of the protests is anger over proposed austerity measures designed to cut France’s 43 billion-euro ($50 billion) deficit. Bayrou’s plan to reduce public spending by eliminating holidays, freezing pensions and welfare payments, and introducing other cuts sparked outrage among workers and unions.Many argue that the measures unfairly target lower and middle-income citizens while sparing wealthy corporations. “The austerity plan punishes those already struggling while rewarding those with influence,” one union representative said during a rally.Despite Bayrou’s departure, the public believes Macron’s government will continue with the cuts. Protesters say they are determined to fight what they describe as unjust economic reforms.Wednesday’s unrest coincided with a strike by London’s Underground workers and a walkout by KLM staff in the Netherlands, reflecting a broader European wave of labour discontent. Rising living costs, inflation and pressure on public finances have fuelled similar demonstrations across the continent.For France, however, the protests carry added weight given the political fragility of Macron’s government and the growing sense of alienation among voters.The “Block Everything” campaign’s unpredictability and breadth of support have drawn comparisons to the “Yellow Vest” uprising. Then, too, Macron faced weeks of street battles, plummeting approval ratings and international scrutiny.Like that earlier movement, “Block Everything” has united people across ideological divides — from students and trade unionists to rural workers and urban activists. While some demonstrators demand economic reforms, others want Macron to step down entirely.The protests are expected to continue for at least two days, with unions threatening further strike action later in September. The largest air traffic controllers’ union has already announced a 24-hour walkout on September 18, raising fears of another wave of travel chaos.For Macron and Lecornu, the coming weeks will be critical. Failure to calm the streets and secure parliamentary backing for the budget could deepen the crisis and weaken the presidency further.With buses burning, trains blocked and more than 300 arrests on day one alone, France faces another turbulent chapter in its long history of social unrest.(With inputs from agencies)","France was gripped by nationwide protests on Wednesday as demonstrators clashed with police, blocked roads and set fires in Paris and other cities.

‘100% Tariffs Now’: Trump Presses Europe Harder To Penalise India, China For Russia Trade | Report

Why EU may not hike tariffs on India, China





US President Donald Trump has reportedly urged the European Union to impose 100% tariffs on countries like India and China for their Russian oil purchases, but the EU may not go ahead with the move.According to a Reuters report quoting EU sources, the European Union has indicated it would likely not implement severe tariffs on India or China, the primary purchasers of Russian oil, despite recommendations from Trump.A delegation from the EU, with the bloc's Russia sanctions head amongst them, travelled to Washington for discussions on aligning sanctions strategies against Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Should India be enthralled by Donald Trump’s outreach to PM Modi? According to officials, Trump suggested the EU should implement tariffs of up to 100% on India and China to exert pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose nation depends on energy sales to finance its military operations in Ukraine.The EU has levied comprehensive sanctions against Russia and has included two banks from China and a prominent Indian refinery in its latest sanctions package released in July.According to the Reuters report, the European Union handles tariffs distinctly from sanctions. Tariffs are implemented only after conducting thorough investigations, which typically extend over several months, to establish legally valid grounds.To date, the EU's tariff impositions related to the Ukraine conflict have been limited to fertilisers and agricultural products from Russia and Belarus. These measures were justified on grounds of preventing strategic dependence that could be exploited, whilst protecting EU-based fertiliser manufacturers from potential harm.An EU diplomat told Reuters confirmed that discussions regarding potential tariffs haven't been initiated with either India or China.“So far, there is no discussion on possible tariffs neither on India...nor with China,"" an EU diplomat was quoted as saying.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner The European Union is currently working towards completing a trade agreement with India, and they are cautious about actions that might compromise this negotiation.By Wednesday, Trump's stance towards India showed signs of softening, as he expressed interest in rebuilding trade relationships with New Delhi.A second EU source quoted in the report highlighted the risks associated with broad tariffs, suggesting that targeting specific entities would be more effective, with the option to remove sanctions if they stop Russian business operations.Until now, the European Union's sanctions have primarily targeted lesser-known entities in third countries, specifically shell companies that facilitate the transfer of military equipment or dual-use goods to Russia's military sector.The EU's 19th sanctions package, potentially to be proposed on Friday, aims to include banks from two central Asian nations and Chinese refineries.Also Read | Pushing back against Trump pressure: India’s state-owned refiners look to fully revive Russia crude oil buys; lack of cargoes an issue","US President Donald Trump has reportedly urged the European Union to impose 100% tariffs on countries like India and China for their Russian oil purchases.

Trump tariff shock: Fitch warns US economy is slowing down; says evidence visible in ‘hard’ economic data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariff-shock-fitch-warns-us-economy-is-slowing-down-says-evidence-visible-in-hard-economic-data/articleshow/123813917.cms,"GDP fluctuations caused by Donald Trump administration's tariff-related factors mask the actual economic deceleration. (AI image)

The final domestic sales figures (GDP without net trade and inventories) decreased to 1.6% annualised, down from the 2.5%-3.0% levels observed in 2023 and 2024.

Consumer spending growth declined to 1.6% annualised in 1H25, compared to 3% during 2023 and 2024.

Services expenditure has significantly decreased due to weakened consumer confidence and increased household savings.

Government expenditure on goods and services, which contributed 0.6pp to yearly GDP growth in both 2023 and 2024, has now reached a plateau.

Private investment patterns have shown variation, with equipment investment showing substantial growth, driven by increased AI-related capital expenditure, whilst investment in commercial and residential properties has decreased.

However, elevated long-term interest rates continue to affect property investment, and considering the heightened policy uncertainty, the overall investment outlook remains modest.

The employment landscape shows signs of slowing. The average monthly increase in payrolls reached only 29,000 during the three months leading to August, marking the lowest level since 2010 (barring the pandemic period). This trend reflects both diminishing labour availability and demand, particularly as restricted immigration policies affect population expansion.

Despite maintaining low unemployment figures, the combination of reduced job creation, steady wage moderation and increasing inflation will negatively impact overall real household earnings, and Fitch anticipates further reduction in consumption during the second half of 2025.

The rise in inflation is expected to reduce real wage increases and affect US consumer expenditure, which has already demonstrated significant slowdown in 2025. Employment expansion has significantly reduced, partially due to immigration restrictions affecting workforce growth. Despite anticipated support from an expanding fiscal deficit in 2026, Fitch projects that the US annual average GDP growth will remain at a subdued 1.6%, considerably lower than the typical trend.





The US economy is slowing down, a fact that is now evident in ‘hard’ data according to Fitch ratings’ latest Global Economic Outlook report. “The US economy is slowing down. Our growth forecasts for both 2025 and 2026 are broadly unchanged from the June GEO at 1.6%, but this represents a sharp deceleration from 2.8% in 2024,” Fitch says in its latest report.The US economy showed a 0.8% expansion (non-annualised) in 2Q25, surpassing Fitch’s June forecast of 0.4%, primarily due to reduced imports. However, the GDP fluctuations caused by Donald Trump administration's tariff-related factors mask the actual economic deceleration, cautions Fitch.“Greater clarity about US tariff hikes does not alter the fact that they are huge and will reduce global growth. And evidence of a slowdown in the US is now appearing in the hard data; it’s no longer just in the sentiment surveys,” said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch.Also Read | Strong domestic demand: Fitch revises India’s GDP growth outlook upwards to 6.9%; expects another RBI rate cut this year Additional tax reductions included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are expected to expand the fiscal deficit, which should bolster demand in the coming year. From early 2026, Fitch expects quarterly GDP growth to improve, although the yearly average growth is projected to remain steady at 1.6%. Recent months have shown a slight increase in core inflation, with tariffs having a minimal impact on prices.“We anticipate a stronger pass-through in the rest of the year as pre-tariff imported inventories are depleted and more firms acknowledge that tariff hikes are here to stay. Nevertheless, we have lowered our end-year CPI forecast to 3.6% from 3.8% in the June GEO,” says Fitch.Also Read | ‘Modi’s war’? How US, EU are 'fuelling', funding Russia-Ukraine conflict “Pass-through from the huge jump in the average effective tariff rate to US CPI inflation has been modest so far, with some evidence in the national accounts that it has partly been offset by downward pressure on corporate profits. But we expect pass-through to accelerate later this year,” it adds.The softening in the labour market will make the Fed more willing to ease policy and we now anticipate 25bp of rate cuts at both the September and December FOMC meetings and three further rate reductions in 2026, it concludes.","US economy showed a 0.8% expansion (non-annualised) in 2Q25, surpassing Fitch’s June forecast of 0.4%.

‘No To Dadagiri’: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari Slams US Tariffs, Calls For Tech Power, Export Growth





MUMBAI: The normally reticent Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) has now complained to union minister of Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari, about the pathetic condition of National Highway (NH48) between Dahisar and Talasari.In a letter to the ministry, the BPP said this highway is the only road connectivity to the pilgrimage site of Udvada in south Gujarat, where the community’s most important fire temple, the Iranshah, is located.""NH-48 Dahisar to Talasari has become a death trap and our community members and senior citizens suffer untold hardships due to poor construction done by NHAI-appointed contractors. All we ask are for our fundamental rights to good roads so that precious lives are not lost,’’ it said.BPP trustee Adil Malia told TOI that the community lost one of its illustrious members, industrialist Cyrus Mistry, on that road due to poor road conditions and unregulated traffic. ""The community has no alternative but to travel on NH48 and the route between Dahisar and Talasari is literally a 'Death Trap'. Several near fatal and serious accidents have been reported,’’ he said.Filly Bapuna, who frequently drives between Udvada and Mumbai, said, ``Driving on the NH-48 is a harrowing experience.It was cement concreted a few months ago, but there are already potholes everywhere. A new Range Rover had a tyre burst twice on this stretch.’’Dr Boorjis H. Doctor, who is leading a campaign for a safe NH-48, said he had a near-death experience this year due to the negligence of the road contractor. ``When I complained against the contractor at the Panvel police station, I was astonished to find that the senior inspector was unaware of the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) norms, leave aside enforcing them’’ he said.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, advocate Sujay Kantawala, said a journey from Boisar to Mumbai on the NH-48 took six hours.""My sister has sworn to travel by train only and described this highway as ""hell on earth’’.Meanwhile, highway activist Harbans Singh Nanade, said that despite spending Rs 600 crore on repairing the NH-48, traffic jams and accidents continue to occur.""This has raised questions about the functioning of NHAI and the contractor. The BRO (Border Roads Organization) is also primarily responsible for constructing and maintaining roads in border areas and difficult mountainous regions. Without wasting time, the services of BRO should be used for NH48 and the Thane - Ghodbunder road for safe travel.Two ambulances, travelling on Mumbai bound lanes, were seen stuck in Tuesday's traffic jam, and that too on the wrong side on the Gujarat bound lane.""Many motorists switch lanes the moment they see a traffic jam, further creating a traffic gridlock on the opposite lane as well, with no-one to stop them,’’ said a motorist.A senior NHAI official said traffic on NH48 is more due to the traffic flow on the Thane - Ghodbunder road.""Though potholes are there, the main reason was the traffic on the Thane bound lane on the Thane - Ghodbunder road. We are laying mastic on old bridges, said the officer when questioned about potholes on NH48.’’"," Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) has complained to union minister of Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari, about the pathetic condition of National Highway (NH48) between Dahisar and Talasari.

Chennai: After months of delay and concerns over possible reallocation, Southern Railway is finally set to operate its first Amrit Bharat Express, a long-distance non-A/C train. The weekly service, numbered 16601/16602, will run between Erode in Tamil Nadu and Jogbani in Bihar, covering a distance of over 3,300 km across eight zones.According to a Railway Board order issued on September 4, the train will depart Erode every Thursday at 7.00 am and return from Jogbani every Sunday at 7.30 am.The service will run via Salem, Katpadi, Perambur, Vijayawada, Nagpur, Jabalpur, Patna, and Katihar, with over 50 commercial halts en route, including major hubs like Itarsi and Barauni.The rake will be maintained at Erode and Katihar (until Jogbani gets its own maintenance facility). It will have 22 coaches in the Amrit Bharat configuration—eight second-class sitting-cum-luggage coaches, 11 second-class sitting coaches, two brake-cum-luggage coaches, and one coach for staff and tools.This deployment follows months of inactivity, during which the Amrit Bharat rake allotted to Southern Railway remained unused since February 2025 despite multiple other zones launching services.The rake, built by ICF Chennai, was stabled at depots like Tiruvottiyur and Naidupeta with no route finalised until now.Southern Railway officials confirmed the inaugural train may operate as a special service before transitioning to regular weekly operations. Naveen Chandar, a transportation activist, said this rollout is a positive start, and he expects Tirunelveli–Shalimar, Tambaram–Santragachi, and Coimbatore–Gaya Amrit Bharat Express services soon.The Railway Board has directed the zonal railways to ensure immediate compliance, planning, and publicity for the new service.","Amrit Bharat Express will run between Erode in Tamil Nadu and Jogbani in Bihar.

Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, has officially overtaken Tesla CEO Elon Musk to become the world’s richest man in 2025. Ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His fortune now stands at $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk. This dramatic shift was fueled by Oracle’s record-breaking earnings report, which sent the company’s stock price soaring. For Musk, the decline in Tesla’s share value has ended his nearly year-long reign at the top. The development underscores the powerful link between corporate performance, stock markets, and the global billionaire wealth rankings.For the first time in his long career, Larry Ellison has claimed the top position on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. At 81 years old, Ellison’s rise highlights his enduring influence in the tech world and the extraordinary growth of Oracle Corporation. His fortune has now reached $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk, who had dominated global wealth rankings since 2024.The driving force behind Ellison’s climb was Oracle’s blockbuster earnings report.The company delivered higher-than-expected quarterly results, a surge in bookings, and an ambitious outlook for future growth in cloud services. This fueled a 41% single-day stock rally, the largest in Oracle’s history. Since Ellison holds most of his wealth in Oracle shares, the stock surge translated into an unprecedented $101 billion personal gain.Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s net worth has slipped due to Tesla’s challenges. Shares of the electric vehicle giant are down 13% in 2025, dragging his fortune to $385 billion and ending his nearly year-long reign at the top. Despite the setback, Musk remains a strong contender, with Tesla’s board proposing a performance-based compensation plan that could make him the world’s first trillionaire if he meets aggressive milestones.Ellison’s ascent also underscores Oracle’s growing presence in the cloud computing market, where it is increasingly challenging industry leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. With Ellison serving as chairman and chief technology officer, the company’s bold expansion into cloud infrastructure has redefined its role in global tech and cemented his position as the wealthiest man alive.Larry Ellison is one of the most influential figures in the technology industry, best known as the co-founder, Executive Chairman, and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Oracle Corporation. Oracle, a global leader in enterprise software and cloud computing, was founded in the late 1970s when Ellison and his team pioneered relational database systems that would eventually dominate the market.For nearly four decades, Ellison served as Oracle’s Chief Executive Officer, shaping its rise from a small start-up into one of the world’s most powerful software companies. He stepped down as CEO in 2014 after 37 years at the helm, but unlike many founders who move aside, Ellison retained direct involvement in the company’s innovation strategy. In his role as Executive Chairman and CTO, he continues to steer Oracle’s research, product development, and long-term direction.Ellison also remains the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 41% of Oracle’s outstanding shares, a stake that forms the backbone of his immense personal fortune. This deep tie between his wealth and Oracle’s performance has made his financial trajectory closely mirror the company’s growth.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ellison’s fortune now stands at an extraordinary $393 billion as of September 10, 2025. This figure reflects the dramatic one-day surge fueled by Oracle’s earnings report and positions him ahead of Musk, whose net worth is currently estimated at $385 billion.The $101 billion leap was not only historic but also symbolic, highlighting how shifts in the technology sector—particularly the cloud computing race—are reshaping the global wealth rankings. Ellison’s rise to the top underscores both the resilience of Oracle under his leadership and his continued relevance as a driving force in Silicon Valley even at the age of 81.","Ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

When Larry Ellison overtook Elon Musk as world’s richest

Ellison's 40% ownership in Oracle resulted in his wealth increasing by $100 billion within thirty minutes of market opening!





Larry Ellison, Oracle’s Chief Technology Officer, overtook Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person on Wednesday - albeit temporarily.The current wealth gap between these titans stands at a relatively modest one billion pounds, considering their enormous net worth: Musk maintains $384.2 billion whilst Ellison holds $383.2 billion.In the initial minutes of trading, Oracle Corp.'s share price increased dramatically, momentarily elevating its co-founder Ellison above the long-standing leader Elon Musk in the world’s wealthiest persons rankings.However, the volatile nature of the stock market restored Musk to the position of the world’s richest person by day's end, according to Bloomberg, as Oracle's shares settled lower than their earlier peak.At Wednesday's close, Oracle shares rose 36% to $328.33, whilst Tesla showed minimal movement, increasing less than 1% to $347.79.The temporary shift in rankings occurred following Oracle's exceptional earnings report, which highlighted substantial customer orders amidst increasing competition in artificial intelligence technology.Larry Ellison ascended to become the wealthiest individual globally, surpassing Elon Musk, who had held this position since four years prior. Musk's position was primarily attributed to his ownership in Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer that is currently experiencing a decline.Tesla's shares have declined by 14% in the current year, displaying a contrasting trajectory to Oracle's performance. Musk maintains control over numerous private enterprises, including the spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX, his AI venture xAI, and X (previously known as Twitter).The previous evening, post market closure, Oracle disclosed securing contracts exceeding $300 billion, including agreements with ""OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia and Musk's xAI"". The company projected its cloud infrastructure revenue to increase by 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, followed by an anticipated rise to $144 billion over the subsequent four-year period.Ellison said in an earnings discussion how the company would generate revenue not only from AI development infrastructure but also from operating AI systems across various sectors, including manufacturing, pharmaceutical research, financial trading, and business automation.The substantial increase in Ellison's wealth on Wednesday morning reflected market confidence in automation replacing human workforce, positioning Oracle to capitalise on this transformation.""AI Changes Everything,"" declared the 81-year-old during the discussion.Meanwhile, Tesla's chief executive faces challenges in persuading investors despite similar aspirations. Following a significant decline in electric vehicle sales early this year, the anticipated recovery hasn't materialised. He has attempted to redirect attention towards Tesla's robotics division and AI developments in autonomous vehicles.Despite his continued optimism about Tesla's prospects, difficulties persist. The company experienced a 40% decline in European Union sales during early summer, marking seven consecutive months of reduction, partly due to his social media support for far-right politicians. US market share has also declined as customers responded negatively to his alignment with Donald Trump.","Ellison's 40% ownership in Oracle resulted in his wealth increasing by $100 billion within thirty minutes of market opening.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The road ahead





VIJAYAWADA: Can a state eradicate poverty within a decade by combining the goodwill of citizens, corporates and communities? Andhra Pradesh is attempting precisely that with an ambitious plan, conceived by chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu: the Zero Poverty P4 programme, which hopes to turn conventional welfare schemes on their head through public, private, people and partnership — the power of four Ps.At the heart of P4 lies a rather unusual proposition: the top 10% of the population is encouraged to support the bottom 20%. The state’s role is not to transfer funds directly, but to act as a facilitator, connecting the wealthy or resourceful with families in distress.The govt says it hopes this model will lift around 15 lakh households out of poverty by 2029.The challenge, however, lies in turning aspiration into practice.The first step is identification. Village and ward secretariat staff have surveyed the state and listed 21.8 lakh families below the poverty line (BPL). These households are designated as “Bangaru Kutumbams” — golden families, while citizens who step forward to help are called “Margadarshis”, or mentors.P4 does not prescribe a uniform benefit. Instead, it is built on customised interventions, with the mentor and family deciding what works best.“Helping poor families does not necessarily mean spending money,” explains Cherukuri Kutumba Rao, vice-chairman of the Zero Poverty P4 Foundation.“An industrialist may provide jobs, a doctor can offer free treatment, and a software professional can train young graduates. Even when there is a need to pay tuition fees or hospital bills, mentors will pay institutions directly, never the beneficiaries in cash.”The roots of P4 go back to the Covid-19 lockdown, a period when India’s rich-poor divide became starkly visible. Though in opposition at the time, Naidu formed a task force of economists, former bureaucrats, and young professionals from IITs and IIMs to study the issue.The research revealed both the depth of deprivation and the urgency of bridging the gap. Naidu, after several brainstorming sessions, framed the P4 idea. According to Rao, Naidu personally spent between Rs 7 crore and Rs 9 crore on this research and consultations.To implement the vision, the state govt set up the Zero Poverty P4 Foundation as the nodal agency. The programme operates under three distinct models: adopting individual families; adopting villages or mandals; and funding a need (see box). The layered design allows both high net-worth donors and ordinary citizens to participate at different scales.The responses so far have been encouraging. In Challapalli, Krishna district, sanitation worker Pallikonda Hemalatha, despite her modest earnings, adopted 74-year-old Charla Kanikaram and pledged to care for her “like a daughter”. Her gesture embodies the programme’s ethos: compassion matters as much as capacity.At the other end of the spectrum, P Krishna Reddy of Megha Engineering has adopted his native Gudlavalleru mandal in Krishna district. He has appointed a ninemember team to assess community needs and oversee welfare for 2,500 poor families, pledging nearly Rs 45 crore for the initiative. His involvement is independent, with the govt limited to providing coordination.The diaspora, too, has responded. Sivaram Kurapati, a professional from Guntur now based in the UK, has adopted over 40 families, funding children’s education. “I always had the ambition to do something for my village. P4 gave me a platform to spend on a meaningful cause and bring positive change,” he says.According to officials, mentors from seven countries have already joined, either individually or through their firms and CSR arms, adopting families and communities back home.P4’s beneficiaries also speak of how their lives have changed. S Pavani from Veerapanenigudem in Krishna district, who lost her husband in an accident two years after she got married, was adopted by HCL foundation and offered a job. “My future looked bleak after my husband died. I didn’t know how I’d have looked after my toddler and aging mother. But now I have a job, and am earning Rs 15,000 per month, thanks to the P4 programme,” she said.Similarly, Kathi Janamma from Paderu speaks of how her mentor, P Nageswara Rao, provided funds to buy a herd of 15 sheep. “We are finally able to make some money by growing sheep. Earlier, it was very difficult for us to make ends meet. Now, I am confident of being able to provide for my kids,” she says.Charity is deeply ingrained in the Indian tradition, and officials believe P4 builds on this cultural capital. “The idea of P4 is to channelise this culture to achieve qualitative and quantitative outcomes with well-defined goals,” Rao says.Yet, the model is not without problems. Because implementation is dynamic and tailored, it demands careful judgment at every step — from identifying genuine beneficiaries to matching them with mentors.Rumours have been a hurdle. Despite official reassurances, word spread in some areas that govt employees had adoption targets to meet, leading to resistance. Similarly, some poor families expected direct cash handouts, leading to disappointment when the help came in the form of services or payments to institutions.A tribal hamlet in NTR district illustrates another pitfall: 40 households, out of 162, sought assistance to set up kirana shops. Such duplication was not viable and reflected limited awareness of sustainable livelihood options.The inclusion of ineligible families has also stirred discontent. To address this, the govt is conducting gram sabhas to verify and sanitise lists of beneficiaries. The core challenge is to align the aspirations of poor households with the willingness and resources of mentors.Economists point out that undivided Andhra Pradesh had been at the forefront of implementing various strategies to address household-level poverty.“They have good experience in dealing with the subject,” says E Revathi, director, Centre for Economic and Social Studies. “Be it establishing women-led self-help groups to nudge economic thrift and savings or the Rural Inclusive Growth Project, the state has a long history of implementing strategies to eradicate poverty. Even the new P4 model can be successful if the poor are handheld and given the required resources by mentors to become self-reliant. However, identifying poor families and their vulnerabilities will be key.”She explains that matching poor families with the right mentor can yield positive results, as knowledge-sharing about schemes in education, employment, and business is essential to provide self-reliance. “Further, creating groups with these families will also be helpful, as they will learn from each other,” she says.Subhash Chandra, assistant professor of economics at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Hyderabad, says the P4 scheme can be effective if the rich actually “adopt” the needy. “In most cases, the help is extended to some of their distant relatives or a family in the known circle. If govt can identify the needy and map them to the rich, this can work. They need to be guided primarily in education and employment,” he adds, saying it is time the govt does its bit to impart skills to the poor instead of just giving them free rations or housing.A few feel this amounts to “passing the buck” to the rich, instead of the govt playing its role to address poverty. “I feel this is not a feasible solution,” says Anirban Dasgupta, economist and professor at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. “It is the govt’s job to tax the rich and use the money for the benefit of the poor, not delegate its work to a few rich people.”He says any serious attempt to address poverty should work through economic growth. “See what China, Taiwan or South Korea did to address poverty. They had fast, broad-based growth. We need that too. We need employment-intensive, labour-intensive industrialisation from which even poor, semi-skilled, and unskilled labourers can benefit. Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we mostly had service-intensive industries, which benefited only a few educated people,” he explains.Despite hurdles, the govt remains committed. Naidu has held multiple meetings with corporate leaders, philanthropists and community organisations, urging them to participate. P4 Foundation is also seeking to tap CSR funds on a larger scale.The goal of eradicating poverty by 2029 is ambitious. For now, lakhs of families are targeted, but scaling participation to meet that mark will depend on engagement from citizens, diaspora, and industry. Whether Andhra can become poverty-free by 2029 will depend on how effectively mentors and families build trust, how flexibly the programme adapts, and whether generosity can be sustained.Whatever the outcome, P4 marks a departure in thinking: poverty alleviation is not a one-way transfer from the state, but a shared responsibility between the fortunate and the less fortunate.","The Zero Poverty P4 programme aims to turn conventional welfare schemes on their head through public, private, people and partnership.
