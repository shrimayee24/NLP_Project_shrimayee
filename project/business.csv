NEW DELHI: WWF ’s Living Planet Report , released on Thursday, calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies ( G20 countries ), noting that it would be least climate-damaging for Earth to support food production by 2050 if all countries adopt India’s pattern. Argentina, Australia and USA are worst on this count.“If everyone in the world adopted the current food consumption patterns of the world’s major economies by 2050, we exceed the 1.5° Celsius climate (warming limit) target for food related greenhouse gas emissions by 263 per cent and require one to seven Earths to support us,” the report says, making special mention of India’s millet mission .The report points out that if all countries adopt the current consumption patterns of India, the world would need ‘less than one earth’ (0.84) by 2050 to support food production. The Indian scenario is even marginally better than the planetary climate boundary for food, indicating the maximum amount of greenhouse gas emissions that food systems can emit to stay within 1.5° Celsius of the warming limit.In contrast, the world will need the highest 7.4 Earths if it adopts the consumption patterns of Argentina. It means Argentina has the worst system on a sustainable benchmark, followed by Australia (6.8), USA (5.5), Brazil (5.2), France (5), Italy (4.6), Canada (4.5) and the UK (3.9). Among the better ones, Indonesia (0.9) figures only after India (0.84) and ahead of China (1.7), Japan (1.8) and Saudi Arabia (2).The report also appreciated India’s ongoing efforts to promote climate-resilient millets ( nutri-cereals ), saying National Millet Campaign is designed to increase national consumption of this ancient grain which is good for health and highly resilient in the face of climate change .“Eating more sustainable diets would reduce the amount of land needed to produce food: grazing land, in particular, could be freed up for other purposes, including nature restoration and carbon sequestration,” says the report. It also underlines the importance of promoting healthy alternative protein sources such as legumes and nutri-cereals, plant-based meat alternatives, and algal species high in nutritional value.","WWF Living Planet Report calls India’s food consumption pattern as most sustainable among big economies.

What’s the main takeaway for India in terms of vulnerability, decline in number of species (specific examples), habitat loss and efforts, whatsoever, to restore/conserve the country’s natural ecosystem?

Do you think those efforts are enough?

What more can be done?

NEW DELHI: With the WWF ’s Living Planet Report 2024 highlighting catastrophic 73% decline in average size of wildlife populations in just 50 years, the TOI on Thursday sought to find out its main takeaway for India. Dipankar Ghose, Director-Biodiversity Conservation, WWF-India, responded to key questions on India and its efforts, whatsoever, to conserve the country’s wildlife populations.Excerpts:India has seen mixed results for species trends. Tiger populations have increased in the country over the last one and half decades, with a mean population estimate of 3682 individuals as per the last count. However, the situation is the opposite for bird populations. Birds in open habitats have declined. In India, scientists developed fine-tuned SDMs (Species Distribution Models) and predicted 1091 terrestrial bird species that would be distributed in the country by 2070 on two climatic surfaces using Maximum Entropy-based species distribution algorithms. Of these bird species, approximately 66-73% species in the country will shift to higher elevations or shift northwards. Another 58% bird species would lose part of their distribution ranges, whereas that of about 40% bird species would increase.Bird species richness is expected to change extensively in both Western and Eastern Himalayas. An overall decrease in the congregation or flock size of birds has also been observed. The State of India’s Birds (2023) assessed data 942 bird species from 30 million observations and reported a 39% decline of species over the past decades. The same report also classified 178 species as of High Conservation Priority. Vultures have seen a major decline between 2002 and 2022, and the latest survey of vultures across India has seen a reduction in populations of the white-rumped vulture by 67%, the Indian vulture by 48% and the slender-billed vulture by 89%. These declines are attributed to use of NSAIDs like acelofenac and ketoprofen.It is important to conserve bird habitats, in urban, peri-urban and natural ecosystems – they are the indicators of major ecosystem health. Even for tigers, while numbers have increased, habitats have declined. The last All India Tiger Estimation Report (NTCA, 2022) stated that 254,880 sq.km of tiger habitat was found to have invasive species at varying magnitudes across the country. Overall, while India has done well to conserve several key wildlife species and, in fact, holds the world’s largest populations of species like the Bengal tiger, greater one-horned rhino and Asiatic elephant as well as a significant population of aquatic species such as the river dolphin and gharial. At the same time, species like the Great Indian Bustard are on the brink of extinction.India has done well in the recovery of endangered species like the greater one-horned rhinoceros, that saw concerted action from the government, scientists and civil society organisations, backed by tremendous support from people. There was a multi-pronged approach, on protection, habitat restoration and management and species recovery through active management. Such efforts are needed for restoring populations of other Critically Endangered and Endangered species. Along with efforts of the government, industries, institutions and CSOs will need to join hands for species-specific restoration efforts.Long-term conservation of wildlife and ecosystems in India requires a holistic, science-based and inclusive approach that integrates well-managed and connected ecosystems and effective species conservation strategies that are implemented in collaboration and with the support of local communities. With new threats like climate change emerging, ecosystem-based adaptation helps in managing climate change impacts, by increasing ecosystem & community resilience. Specific actions include restoration of wetlands and mangroves. OECMs (Other Effective Area Based Conservation Measures) that support conservation in areas outside formally protected areas with the engagement of communities, businesses and individuals are also a way forward in protecting nature.","India has seen mixed results for species trends, bird populations in open habitats have declined.

"Wildlife Populations: Monitored wildlife populations plummeted 73% in just 50 yrs, says WWF report; experts highlight alarming vulture losses in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monitored-wildlife-populations-plummeted-73-in-just-50-yrs-says-wwf-report-experts-highlight-alarming-vulture-losses-in-india/articleshow/114101671.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: X)

NEW DELHI: There has been a steep 73 per cent decline globally in the average size of ‘monitored wildlife populations ’ in just 50 years (1970-2020), said the WWF ’s Living Planet Report-2024 with experts underlining an alarming decline in the population of three vulture species in India between 1992 and 2002.The report, carrying the Zoological Society of London’s Living Planet Index (LPI), noted strongest decline in freshwater populations (85 per cent) followed by terrestrial (69 per cent) and marine populations (56 per cent) among the 34,836 monitored wildlife populations of 5,495 vertebrate species of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles.The report, released on Thursday, also highlights how the ecological degradation and habitat loss , driven primarily by the food system, combined with pollution and climate change increases the likelihood of reaching local, regional and global tipping point — a critical threshold resulting in potentially irreversible change.In the Indian context, it cites an example of Chennai, saying the rapid urban expansion in the city has resulted in an 85 per cent decline in wetlands areas during the period leaving the people vulnerable to both droughts and floods.“When severe drought hit the region, it caused the city’s major reservoirs to run dry and groundwater levels to plummet in 2019. Without its wetlands to retain and recharge water supplies, the city of 11.2 million people was left vulnerable and forced to truck in water to meet basic needs like drinking, cooking and bathing,” said the report.Referring to a 2022 nationwide survey in India, experts from WWF-India noted that the white-rumped vulture population has dropped by 67 per cent, the Indian vulture by 48 per cent, and the slender-billed vulture by a staggering 89 per cent compared to their populations in 2002.Since vultures provide essential ecosystem services by removing carcasses, recycling nutrients and reducing transmission of some diseases, they called for an urgent need to protect these critical scavengers and maintain ecological balance.Citing an example of an increase in tiger population, they, however, noted that despite a decline in many wildlife populations in India, some have stabilised and shown recovery largely due to proactive government initiatives, effective habitat management and robust scientific interventions.Explaining the tipping point, the WWF-India experts, including Sejal Worah and Dipankar Ghose, also flagged that more than 36 per cent of the country’s forest cover has been estimated to be prone to frequent forest fires, noting that India detected a total of over 4.48 lakh alerts for forest fires between 2021 and 2024.At a regional level, the fastest declines in ‘monitored wildlife populations’ have been noticed in Latin America and the Caribbean (95 per cent) followed by Africa (76 per cent) and Asia and the Pacific (60 per cent). The report noted that the declines have been less dramatic in Europe and Central Asia (35 per cent) and North America (39 per cent), saying this reflects the fact that large-scale impacts on nature were already apparent before 1970 in these regions.Noting that over half of GDP (55 per cent) is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services, the report called for making progress on the global goals for reversing nature loss by 2030 through transforming energy, food and finance systems.“Nature is issuing a distress call. The linked crises of nature loss and climate change are pushing wildlife and ecosystems beyond their limits, with dangerous global tipping points threatening to damage Earth’s life-support systems and destabilize societies. The catastrophic consequences of losing some of our most precious ecosystems, like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs, would be felt by people and nature around the world,” said Kirsten Schuijt, director general of WWF International.","There has been a steep 73 per cent decline globally in the average size of ‘monitored wildlife populations ’ in just 50 years (1970-2020), said the WWF ’s Living Planet Report-2024.

Paw-sitive legacy: Bombay House-Tata Group's century doors remain open to strays,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paw-sitive-legacy-bombay-house-tata-groups-century-doors-remain-open-to-strays/articleshow/114100669.cms,"Legend Ratan Tata No More; Dies At Mumbai Hospital I Tributes Pour In I Tata Sons

While Ratan Tata 's love for animals is well documented, it is also no secret that the only denizens allowed to walk into Bombay House - the Tata Group 's century-old headquarters in Mumbai - without an access card are stray dogs . When the century-old heritage building was renovated and reopened in July 2018, the 86-year-old chairman of Tata Trusts is believed to have allocated a room for the welfare of streets dogs in the vicinity.Apart from non-residents who saunter in now and then, the swish yellow ground-floor kennel - that has a flap door, a bathing area and a team of doctors - houses the formerly-homeless Goa, Sweety, Junior, Simba, Chhotu, Rana, Jackal, Bushy and Munni as permanent residents. Besides cushions, toys and chewies, their upgraded lifestyle apparently entails food boiled in the five-star's kitchen.His social media accounts offer a visual collage of Tata's love for canines. Sur, Sprite and Myra are among the hounds in need on behalf of whom he has posted timely pleas seeking things like blood donation and adoption. ""Of all the different sufferings that animals today have to go through, my heart truly breaks for the ones that get abandoned by families. I cannot imagine what must go through their minds when one day they have a home, and the next they don't,"" read a post urging people to adopt 9-month-old Myra, a dog that had been abandoned.Another monsoon-related post talked about the importance of checking under the car before turning it on to avoid injuries to stray animals taking shelter.On the 14th birthday of his late dog, Tito, the caption under a picture posted on Instagram that showed the veteran holding his pet's paw read: ""I still come home to two kind souls and meet so many others in and around the office. While few have the comfort of families, many struggle on the streets, and yet somehow, their affection remains the same. Those of you who strive for the welfare of the voiceless, truly have my respect.""It was Tata's transcontinental struggle to find advanced care for his injured dog that recently led to the birth of six-month-old Small Animal Hospital Mumbai (SAHM) - a 98,000 square-feet facility in Mahalaxmi that offers round-the-clock medical care for dogs, cats, rabbits, and other small animals. In an exclusive interview with TOI before the hospital's inauguration, Tata had recalled the ordeal he faced before he flew his dog to University of Minnesota in the US for a joint replacement. ""But I was too late, and so they froze the dog's joint in a particular position. That experience enabled me to see what a world-class veterinary hospital was equipped to do.""""In a world where pandemics are caused by the proximity of animals and humans; where rabies still kills; and where there is a rising storm of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; animal health is more important than ever,"" says the hospital's chief veterinary officer Dr Thomas Heathcote in a quote mentioned on the hospital website, adding that SAHM believe in partnering with pet parents and other vets of Mumbai to create a positive world ""where health and wellness are achievable, and medical assistance is accessible to all.""","The 86-year-old chairman of Tata Trusts is believed to have allocated a room for the welfare of streets dogs in the vicinity.

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.

Mr Ratan N. Tata Exclusive Interview with Suhel Seth

MUMBAI: Ratan Naval Tata, whose long stewardship saw the Tata Group transform into a global powerhouse, passed away at Breach Candy Hospital around 11pm on Wednesday night. The 86-year-old was admitted for dehydration issues on Monday.Tata’s passing marks the end of an extraordinary corporate journey, one that not only reshaped the Tata Group but also set new benchmarks for Indian industry on the global stage.Under his stewardship, the group’s revenue surged from $4 billion in 1991 to over $100 billion by 2012, when he retired, making it the first Indian conglomerate to achieve such a milestone.Born to Soonoo and Naval Tata during British rule in Mumbai (then Bombay), Ratan Tata grew up in Tata House — now the India headquarters of Deutsche Bank — in Fort. A teetotaller and a non-smoker, he was a bachelor who came close to marrying thrice but remained single throughout his life.He is survived by two brothers, Jimmy and Noel, and their families, along with his stepmother, Simone Tata.Educated at three prestigious institutions including Campion School and Cathedral and John Connon School in South Mumbai, and Bishop Cotton in Shimla, Ratan Tata shared classrooms with notable figures like music maestro Zubin Mehta and business magnates Ashok Birla and Rahul Bajaj, Duke owner Dinshaw Pandole and Cipla’s Yusuf Hamied.He went on to get a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University, initially starting as an engineering student at his father’s insistence. Disenchanted with engineering, he shifted to architecture after two years and briefly worked with Jones and Emmons in Los Angeles, turning down a job offer from IBM. In 1962, he joined Tata Group as an assistant in Tata Industries, rising to the top after 29 years to become chairman of Tata Sons.His tenure was marked by a concerted effort to remove the old guard of satraps and to position Tata Sons as the nerve centre for strategic direction across the group. His leadership also saw Tata Sons tighten its grip over group companies, requiring them to pay royalties for using the Tata brand.He led the group into new sectors like telecom and passenger cars and was instrumental in fostering innovation with landmark projects such as Indica, India’s first indigenous car; Nano, the world’s most affordable vehicle; and Ginger, a budget hotel chain, while overseeing more than 60 acquisitions that expanded the group’s reach. He also took Tata Consultancy Services public, the only major Tata company to do so.Ratan Tata’s legacy, however, was not without controversies. His decision to appoint Cyrus Mistry as his successor in 2011 sparked one of the most contentious chapters in the group’s history. He subsequently selected N Chandrasekaran to lead Tata Sons after Mistry's acrimonious exit in 2016. Additionally, his dream of creating the world’s cheapest car (Nano) faced political opposition in West Bengal, leading to the relocation of production to Gujarat.In 2008, Ratan Tata was awarded the Padma Vibhushan , India's second-highest civilian honour.Despite his many successes, Ratan Tata remained remarkably humble, often attributing his achievements to the efforts of those around him. A believer in steering clear of politics, he once remarked, “Like my mentor JRD Tata, I had never considered politics. I am not cut out to be a political person and will not venture into it.”Beyond the boardroom, he was known for his quiet but resolute demeanour, often choosing to stay out of the limelight. His contributions extended far beyond business as he led numerous philanthropic initiatives through the Tata Trusts , quietly but significantly impacting sectors like healthcare, education, and rural development.He maintained a low profile in retirement, with sporadic public appearances — the last one being on August 15 this year, when he visited the Tata Fire Temple in Bandra to celebrate the Parsi new year.In the post-retirement years, Ratan Tata also became an angel investor in numerous startups, including Upstox, FirstCry, and Ola Electric – proof, if any was needed, of his continued commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship. He also significantly increased his focus on philanthropy through Tata Trusts, transforming the organisation’s funding approach to prioritise large-scale social initiatives, such as establishing cancer care hospitals and setting up India’s largest tertiary care centre for small animals, including strays, in Mumbai.Though his physical activity decreased in recent years, with even more reduced public appearances, he maintained sharp eyesight and engaged in virtual meetings for both official and philanthropic work.Beyond business, Ratan Tata had a personal passion for aviation, holding pilot licences for both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. He was also an avid scuba diver and indulged in it until health restrictions limited his mobility. He also had a deep love for dogs, building a special swimming pool for his pets at his Colaba residence, Halekai.Ratan Tata himself designed Halekai as well as his 2,000sq ft beach bungalow in Alibaug.

India clears two mega defence projects for 2 indigenous nuclear submarines & 31 Predator drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-clears-two-mega-defence-projects-for-2-indigenous-nuclear-submarines-31-predator-drones/articleshow/114095147.cms,"INS Chakra

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday cleared the mega indigenous project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as the deal to acquire 31 weaponised MQ-9B Predator drones from the US, collectively worth around Rs 68,000 crore, as part of the long-term plan to counter China’s aggressive and expansionist tactics in the region, sources told TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the long-pending Rs 40,000 crore `Project-77’ to construct the two nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs in naval parlance), which will be armed with conventional missiles, torpedoes and other weapons, at the ship-building centre at Visakhapatnam , the sources said.The CCS also gave the green signal to the around Rs 28,000 crore ($3.3 billion) acquisition of the 31 MQ-9B drones, with 15 Sea Guardians earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, paving the way for the govt-to-govt deal to be inked within the next few days.Both the SSNs and the MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft are `hunter-killer’ weapon platforms because they can quietly gather intelligence, track enemy targets at extended ranges and then destroy them if required. The twin-capability, one deep underwater and the other high in the air, is crucial given China’s rapidly-expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond.“It will take around 10-12years for the first SSN, with a 190 MW pressurised light-water reactor and a displacement of almost 10,000-tonne, to roll out. The two SSNs will be around 95% indigenous, with foreign help only being taken for some design consultancy,” a source said.The original case was for six such SSNs, which with their speeds of over 30 knots, long endurance and capability to discreetly operate in enemy waters are meant for conventional (non-nuclear) warfare. “Apart from anti-ship missiles and torpedoes to take out enemy warships and submarines, they will also have land-attack cruise missiles. The other four SSNs will be cleared at a later stage,” a source said.The approval comes soon after India commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN, which is for strategic deterrence, not conventional warfare) as INS Arighaat on Aug 29, and plans to induct the third as INS Aridhaman early next year.TOI was the first to report on Aug 10 about the impending commissioning of INS Arighaat as well as that the case for the two SSNs was headed for the final approval of the CCS after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations.The first MQ-9B remotely-piloted aircraft, in turn, will be delivered within three years, with all the 31 coming in six years after being assembled in India. They are capable of long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions and over-the-horizon targeting, and can also undertake anti-warship and anti-submarine warfare operations.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the 31 fighter-sized drones will come with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, among other associated equipment.India will also equip the drones with indigenous weapons, including the naval short-range anti-ship missiles (NASM-SR) being developed by DRDO , in the future.Under the deal, drone-manufacturer General Atomics will set up a MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here and provide performance-based logistics support for eight years. Apart from making an investment in India and sourcing 34% of components from Indian companies, the company will also provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and others to develop such high-altitude, long endurance drones indigenously.The sheer operational utility of SSNs can be gauged from the fact that the AUKUS military pact among the US, UK and Australia, with an eye firmly on China, revolves around Canberra gradually acquiring at least eight SSNs.In India, as per long-standing approved plans, four SSBNs and six SSNs, apart from 18 diesel-electric submarines, are required to tackle the twin-threat from China and Pakistan.","The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the long-pending Rs 40,000 crore project.

Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India

MUMBAI: The income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) recently ruled that income earned in the US would be taxable for an individual residing in India. While the individual initially declared an income of Rs 9,570 for 2012-13, his taxable income surged to Rs 43.5 lakh after the US income was added.Under tax laws, residential status determines tax liability. Non-residents, for example, are not taxed in India on foreign income.However, in this case, the individual was a tax resident of both India and the US, requiring the application of the 'tie-breaker test' under the India-US tax treaty to determine which country he was a resident of.Applying this test, which takes into account certain criteria, ITAT concluded that the individual's ""centre of vital interest"" was closer to India, making his US income taxable in India.Applying the tiebreaker test, ITAT, in the case of a person who is a tax resident of both India and the US, has held that income earned in the US was taxable in India.Tax experts said the tiebreaker test is applied in cases of dual residency.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said a returning Indian, for instance, could be a tax resident of both India (based on the number of days in the country) and the US (based on citizenship). “In determining basic residency under domestic tax laws of each country, the fact that US tax residency (among other conditions) is based on US citizenship/green card status does have its own nuances as such individuals ar e always taxed in the US on their global income.”In this particular case, the individual was a tax resident of India, having spent more than 183 days in the country in 2012-13. He was also a US citizen, one of the criteria for tax residency in America.“The tie-breaker test is sequential, meaning if the tie is broken at one stage, subsequent criteria do not need to be applied. But, these criteria are highly subjective and vary with each individual’s circumstances,” Sirwalla said.The individual argued that his family (wife and three children) were a ll US citizens and one of his daughters was studying in the US. While he earned income from investments in both India and the US, he held larger investments in the US, and hence claimed he was a US resident. Accordingly, he said, his US income should not be taxed in India.The I-T department said the man had spent more than 183 days in India, and his wife and two of his children lived in Mumbai, while only one daughter resided in the US.ITAT noted that determining the ‘centre of vital interest’ requires analysing both personal and economic relationships. It observed that while the man had family ties to the US, his immediate family and business activities were centred in India. His siblings and parents residing in the US were deemed less relevant than his stay in India with his wife and children. ITAT gave more weight to his active business involvement in India over his passive investments in the US.The man had returned to India to run a film distribution company, co-founded with his wife in 2009, and was actively involved in its operations. Thus, ITAT ruled that he was a resident of India, making his US income taxable here.","Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India.

BENGALURU: Isro , which got the Union cabinet clearance for its fourth lunar mission , the Chandrayaan-4 , has completed the initial design study for setting up a facility to process the 2-3kg of lunar samples this mission will bring back to Earth, while the long-term lunar vision will involve setting up of permanent communication networks and establishing GPS-like infrastructure on Moon and much more.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Isro chairman S Somanath said: “Currently, the experience for handling any such material is only with PRL. And, they have been doing it with very sophisticated instruments. But, raw material containerisation, slicing, and preserving it for long periods of time will all require much more facilities.”At present, he said, project detail has been worked out by PRL and that a configuration of that was available. “Facility building is currently under discussion. This cannot happen in a short time and cost is also high. We will have to look at how to contain costs as we cannot spend too much money on sample processing, this will cost hundreds of crores. So we are looking at how to do it at a low cost. Those discussions are going on,” Somanath said.Pointing out that Chandrayaan-4 and other missions approved by the cabinet on Sept 18 are only part of the first phase of the long-term vision set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Somanath said, space station enhancement will be the next step as the clearance now is only for the first unit of the Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS) and Isro needs four more units of BAS.Following this, Isro will focus on missions to the space station — each mission is a rocket-plus-crew module involving cost, which would differ based on whether it is crewed or uncrewed.“A series of these missions will need approvals, for building/constructing and integration. After that we’ll need at least 3-4 missions a year to the space station. The next set of approvals will be the Chandrayaan series of missions. These are beyond Chandrayaan-5,” Somanath said.Isro will need many technologies to be proven. “For example, we’ll need to go around the Moon and come back. Then, we should scale up the payload capacity which will be similar to the one with the mission that will ultimately take humans to the Moon. We also need to establish communication infrastructure on the Moon so that you don’t depend on the module that we sent alone. We need a permanent communication relay station there,” Somanath said.Human landing would also need navigation infrastructure like GPS. “Landing is very difficult given the nature of the Moon. Right now we use cameras to look at the terrain to finalise a precise location for landing. Precise landing is easier on Earth because we have navigational tools. There are global efforts to build navigation infra for the Moon using multiple satellites and India should also become part of it and make some contribution so that we can use it,” Somanath said.Lastly, he said, India would need to establish ground systems. Right now, Isro has only one deep space network, which won’t be enough. It will need a global network, which includes bigger antennas in other continents.“...We have started discussions on this. We also need to have a space-based communication network using relay satellites. Work on this is happening for Gaganyaan. It has reached reasonable completion and will be launched in the coming days. Many such components are required. We’ve identified various phases in which we will seek approvals,” Somanath said.",Isro has completed the initial design study for setting up a facility to process the 2-3kg of lunar samples this mission will bring back to Earth.

Stock market today : The Sensex and Nifty, India's benchmark equity indices, closed lower on Wednesday despite early gains, as late selling in major index constituents like Reliance Industries, ITC, and HDFC Bank offset the positive sentiment from the RBI's monetary policy review.The Sensex fell 167.71 points or 0.21 per cent to close at 81,467.1, while the Nifty dropped 31.20 points or 0.12 per cent to end at 24,981.95.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained its key interest rate but shifted its policy stance from relatively hawkish to 'neutral', signaling a potential rate cut in the future. The monetary policy committee, comprising three RBI officials and three new external members, voted five-to-one to keep the repo rate at 6.5 per cent for the tenth consecutive policy meeting.Among the Sensex companies, ITC, Nestle India, Hindustan Unilever, Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro, and HDFC Bank were the major laggards. In contrast, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra, State Bank of India, Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Finance, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, and Bharti Airtel were among the gainers.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, commented, ""An upward revision in Q3FY25 inflation reiterates that the sticky inflation continues to remain a concern for the RBI and led investors to book profit towards the close.

Ratan Tata: Moving the Tata Group Beyond India

Watch: When Ratan Tata became emotional while speaking about his dream project

When Ratan Tata Became Emotional While Speaking About Dream Project | Interview With Navika Kumar

Veteran industrialist Ratan Tata died on Wednesday at the age of 86 in Mumbai. The Tata Group veteran was earlier admitted to intensive care at Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital.On Monday, Tata said he was undergoing routine medical investigations due to his age and related medical conditions.Apart from being known as one of India's most successful business tycoons, Tata was also one of the biggest philanthropists in the country.Born to Naval and Soonoo Tata on December 28, 1937, Tata and his younger brother, Jimmy, were brought up by their grandmother, Navajbai R Tata, in a baroque manor called Tata Palace in downtown Bombay [now Mumbai].Ratan Tata went to Cornell University in the United States where he studied architecture and structural engineering, and those years in America from 1955 to 1962 would influence Ratan Tata tremendously.He travelled the country and got so charmed by California and that West Coast lifestyle that he was ready to settle down in Los Angeles. But when Lady Navajbai's health deteriorated, Tata was forced to return to a life he thought he had left behind.Back in India, Tata had a job offer from IBM but JRD Tata wasn't amused.“He called me one day and he said you can’t be here in India and working for IBM. I was in [the IBM office] and I remember he asked me for a resume, which I didn’t have. The office had electric typewriters so I sat one evening and typed out a resume on their typewriter and gave it to him,” Ratan Tata had mentioned in an interview.And that was how Tata came to be offered a job, in 1962, with Tata Industries, the promoter company of the group (he would go on to spend six months at Telco, now called Tata Motors , before joining Tisco, now Tata Steel , in 1963).During his tenure, the group’s revenues grew manifold. Tata was the chairman of major Tata companies, including Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Tata Consultancy Services , Tata Power, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Chemicals, Indian Hotels and Tata Teleservices. He is also associated with various organisations in India and overseas. Tata is on the international advisory boards of Mitsubishi Corporation and JP Morgan Chase.Ratan Tata took over as the chairman of Tata Sons in March 1991.Less than a decade from the new millennium, the Tata group was a bloated, unevenly managed and excessively bureaucratic behemoth operating in an India that had only begun jettisoning the jargon of socialism and the shibboleths of policy-making that had promised plenty but delivered little. More than 30 years later, Ratan Tata has changed the group for the better in a more substantial manner than any of the luminaries under whose care the organisation evolved since its inception in 1868.That he has done this while staying true to the traditions and tenets of the group — in an environment where so many have succumbed to the allure of the soft buck — make his accomplishments exemplary. By coincidence or destiny, Tata becoming chairman got synchronised with the opening up of India’s economy, and he seized the day.Ratan N Tata was the chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, from 1991 till his retirement on December 28, 2012.After retirement, Tata was conferred the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons, Tata Industries, Tata Motors, Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals.He was the chairman of the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Allied Trusts, and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Allied Trusts. He was the Chairman of the Council of Management of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.He also served on the board of trustees of Cornell University and the University of Southern California.After serving in various companies, he was appointed director-in-charge of the National Radio and Electronics Company in 1971.In 1981, he was named Chairman of Tata Industries, the group’s other holding company, where he was responsible for transforming it into a group strategy think tank and a promoter of new ventures in high-technology businesses.The government honoured Tata with the nation's second-highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 2008 and Padma Bhushan in the year 2000.He has also received honorary doctorates from several universities in India and overseas.Tata began restructuring the Tata group at a time when the liberalisation of the Indian economy was under way.He played an instrumental role in the business expansion of popular cars including the Tata Nano and Tata Indica. He got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to acquire Corus in 2004.","Ratan Tata died on Wednesday at the age of 86 in Mumbai.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

They could be victims of child labor, of slavery, of many things... also of children in armed conflict,"" M'jid said.She warned that with fighting and lawlessness becoming embedded in several societies globally, such as Sudan and Haiti, ""violence becomes normal.""""When your children are experiencing violence since their early childhood, seeing only that... how are you going to deal with all this?""Violence against children has a ripple effect, damaging their mental health, impairing their education and stymying their productivity later in life, the report argues.""Even if you look at it from the perspective of the cost, it is 11 percent of the national GDP in some countries,"" M'jid warned.The solution lies in a coordinated approach to public spending, involvement of business and civil society, and engaging children themselves, she said.But squeezed budgets and the rise of conservative policies on sexual health and reproductive rights risk holding back efforts to combat violence against children, M'jid warned.""The issue of the far-right wing and conservatism in many countries will also set back some forms of action regarding sexual reproductive health (and) gender issues,"" M'jid said.""We are facing a very difficult moment,"" she added.""These children will be the parents of the future generation.""","Young people facing wave of violence and sexual abuse driven by war, climate change, hunger, and displacement.

All about Nobel prize in Physics



From 1901 to 2023, the Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 117 times to a total of 225 laureates. Notably, John Bardeen is the only recipient to have won the prize twice, in 1956 and 1972. This brings the total number of individuals who have received the Nobel Prize in Physics to 224.

The youngest Nobel laureate is Lawrence Bragg. He received the prize in 1915 “for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays”

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was assigned to award the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry, the Karolinska Institutet was chosen for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and a committee of five members elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) for the Nobel Peace Prize.

In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences tasked with selecting the laureates starting in 1969.

The Nobel prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.”The 2024 Nobel Prize laureates in Physics utilized tools from their field to develop methods that have significantly contributed to the foundation of modern machine learning.John Hopfield created a framework capable of storing and reconstructing information, while Geoffrey Hinton developed a technique that enables the independent discovery of properties within data, which is crucial for today’s large artificial neural networks.He developed a network that employs a method for storing and reconstructing patterns, where the nodes can be visualized as pixels. The Hopfield network draws on physics principles related to a material's properties influenced by atomic spin, which allows each atom to act as a tiny magnet.This network is described in terms similar to the energy in a spin system, and it is trained by adjusting the connection values between nodes to ensure that the stored images maintain low energy levels. When presented with a distorted or incomplete image, the Hopfield network systematically updates the values of its nodes, reducing its energy to find the stored image that most closely resembles the input.He built upon the Hopfield network to create a new model known as the Boltzmann machine, which employs a different learning method to recognize key features in specific types of data. Hinton utilized concepts from statistical physics, which studies systems composed of many similar components.The Boltzmann machine is trained by providing it with examples that are highly probable when the machine is executed. It can classify images and generate new instances of the patterns it has learned.","The Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The government said the discovery in the case has been voluminous, totaling several terabytes of electronic materials including cellphones, laptops, tablets and cloud accounts. The government said it has been in close coordination with the defense. Diddy's lawyers said they ask the court to require the government to immediately produce information like copies of Comb's electronic devices that were seized six months ago. The timely production of these material is critical to Diddy's ability to prepare his defense, Diddy's lawyers said. Since these devices belong to Diddy, their production should not be delayed by the government's initial review for responsiveness and privilege. The defense said the government indicated that they will be able to produce these devices in the next 30 days. Diddy continues to assert his right to a speedy trial, his lawyers said.

"After Jaishankar rules out bilateral talks during SCO summit, Pakistan follows suit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/after-jaishankar-rules-out-bilateral-talks-during-sco-summit-pakistan-follows-suit/articleshow/114020885.cms,"S Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit , following India's refusal earlier. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.Responding to a question on Jaishankar's visit and India-Pakistan relations , the spokesperson said that Pakistan had ""officially received notification"" about the visit and is prepared to welcome all participating members.Further on the question of bilateral talks, the spokesperson cited Jaishnakar's refusal and assured to toe the same line.""Regarding your question about bilateral meetings, I would like you to refer to the remarks made by the Indian minister for external affairs on 5th of October, in which he maintained that his visit was meant for a multilateral event and not for discussing Pakistan-India relations. These remarks are self-explanatory,"" she said.The last time an Indian external affairs minister visited Pakistan was when Sushma Swaraj in December 2015 travelled for a forum on the Afghanistan issue. However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit.

"'Mountaineering testament to strength...': Nima Rinji Sherpa becomes youngest to summit all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mountaineering-testament-to-strength-nima-rinji-sherpa-becomes-youngest-to-summit-all-14-peaks-above-8000-meters/articleshow/114081056.cms,"Nima Rinji Sherpa

An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nima Rinji Sherpa set a new world record by becoming the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.As per the news agency ANI, his historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma , marking the culmination of his two-year mission to conquer the most daunting mountains on the planet.Summiting all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" is considered the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, requiring climbers to cross into ""death zones,"" where oxygen levels are too low to support human life for long periods. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength and determination.Looking back at his journey, Nima posted about the achievement on his Instagram page. He said, ""This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us. Mountaineering is more than labour; it is a testament to our strength, resilience, and passion.""Wanting this feat to be an inspiration for the younger generation, he further said, ""Through #SherpaPower, I want to show the younger generation of Sherpas that they can rise above the stereotype of being only support climbers and embrace their potential as top-tier athletes, adventurers, and creators. We are not just guides; we are trailblazers. Let this be a call to every Sherpa to see the dignity in our work, the power in our heritage, and the limitless possibilities in our future.""""To humanity as a whole: let this climb remind us that the peaks we reach together, united, are far greater than any individual achievement. As a teenager, witnessing the division caused by borders, wars, racism and other conflicts, I call for love, respect, and harmony among all people. In this vast world, we are but one human race. No summit, no boundary, no conflict is worth more than the peace and unity we can achieve by understanding and supporting one another,"" he added.Then he called out to the people to preserve nature and said, ""The mountain does not define us; we define the mountain We are its guardians, similarly the world we live in should be defined by people who reside in it ! Let’s all unite to protect and preserve our natural resources to live a sustainable and adventurous life!""Nima Rinji hails from a family of renowned mountaineers.He reached the summit of Shisha Pangma early in the morning, accompanied by fellow climber Pasang Nurbu Sherpa. ""He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well, and I was confident he would do it,"" said his father, Tashi Sherpa, while expressing pride in his son’s accomplishment.The President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association , Nima Nuru Sherpa also expressed his happiness at Rinji’s achievement. “This is a proud moment for our country. Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination"".Nima Rinji began his mountaineering career in earnest in August 2022 when he summited Mount Manaslu at the age of 16. By June 2024, he had successfully climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. His ascent of Shisha Pangma on October 9, 2024, completed his record-breaking achievement.The record for the youngest person to summit all 14 peaks was previously held by Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa, who achieved the feat at the age of 30 in 2019. Nima Rinji, however, accomplished the same feat at just 18 years and five months, completing his journey in two years and ten days, according to Seven Summit Treks, the expedition organiser.Nepali climbers, particularly Sherpas, have long been considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas, often carrying equipment and setting up routes for foreign climbers. However, in recent years, Sherpas have gained recognition in their own right, taking centre stage in some of the most challenging climbs.","Nima Rinji Sherpa is the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.

Reality via research

Same old story

all

Remember that movie,? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why don’t you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem – by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into.That scene tells you everything about Singapore’s wealth.It reinforced a certain image of the city-state. Singapore – everything’s shiny, everyone’s happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called “5Cs”, it defined Singaporeans’ aspirations – cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this.Plus…This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick.But…Singapore is not all shiny, happy.A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the world’s top 100 restaurants) won’t probably see this, or even know about it – there’s poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And it’s a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing.Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesn’t.Why? Singapore govt’s approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (“Inequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poor”) is “to reward citizens in alignment with the work that is done”. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants “citizens…to protect themselves…to do it themselves”.If that’s your take on poverty, obviously there’ll be no official poverty line. Naturally, there’s no official count of poor people either.With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (“A handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singapore”), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, “there are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute poverty…these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree households”.Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesn’t earn enough to cover basic needs.In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldn’t think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty.Economists also use a concept called relative poverty – a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order).By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced “stagnating wages and an increased cost of living”. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But it’s also true for that island of gleaming high-rises.In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: “The city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.”The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, it’s not race but class that’s become the deepest social faultline.Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp income inequality in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons that’s produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance – but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty.None of this invalidates Singapore’s success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people don’t know exists.To saySingaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony.","At $141,500, its per capita income in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally.

Tourism Crunch

The president of the Maldives swept into power a year ago on a campaign to push India out of the island nation’s affairs and draw closer to China. Now, as a debt crisis looms and earlier Chinese loans come due, he is in New Delhi looking to mend some fences.Mohamed Muizzu arrived in New Delhi on Sunday on his first state visit, with the country’s financial crisis likely to be a key feature of discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.Prior to his visit, Muizzu has softened his rhetoric notably, saying he’s never opposed India and New Delhi knows the financial strain his nation is under and was willing to help.That’s a contrast to a year ago when he took office, pushing for the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Maldives and promising new big-ticket projects backed by China. His campaign thrust the Maldives to the center of the rivalry between the two powers, which have been vying for influence over the Indian Ocean nation known for pristine beaches and its strategic location straddling global shipping routes.Both countries — and others — have poured hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans into the Maldives in recent years, saddling the tourism-dependent nation amid a protracted economic slowdown, a drought of foreign reserves and a slow return of visitors.The country’s debt is estimated at 110% of gross domestic product, and risks are growing it may fail to make payments on its sukuk. If that were to happen, it would be the world’s first default of an Islamic bond.India gave the Maldives a $50 million lifeline last month to help it avoid that outcome, but that was likely only a short-term fix given additional looming payments, according to investors and analysts.Fitch Ratings estimates the country’s total external debt obligations will grow to $557 million in 2025, and exceed $1 billion by 2026. The island nation’s foreign reserves stood at just $437 million as of the end of August, sufficient to cover only around one-and-a-half months of imports.A default event was looking more likely, according to Fitch, while the International Monetary Fund has also warned of a potential debt crisis.“This is a growing concern and the debts are piling up,” said Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “They’ve been able to repay until now. What will happen next is something we will have to see.”Muizzu met with India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday and is due to meet with Modi on Monday.China and India are the No. 1 and 2 external lenders for Maldivian central government debt, respectively. The Maldives owed about $400 million to the Export-Import Bank of India and about $530 million to the Export-Import Bank of China at the end of last year, according to official figures.The Maldives Monetary Authority has said officials are working on a $400 million foreign-currency swap with India’s central bank, which could provide a key source of funds for future debt payments. China meanwhile has said it’s held discussions with Male over debt relief.“President Muizzu has tried to steer the Maldives away from its traditional reliance on India to a more independent foreign policy, including friendlier relations with China,” said Søren Mørch, head of emerging markets debt at Danske Bank AS. “This recent bailout from India has shown the limits of this approach.”The debt crunch comes as the Maldivian economy has failed to maintain momentum in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While GDP growth reached 13.9% in 2022, it slowed to 4% last year, with tourists spending at rates below pre-pandemic levels, according to the World Bank.Relations between the Maldives and India took a dive in January after a social-media spat in which a Maldivian deputy minister mocked Modi, prompting a backlash from Indian citizens and several celebrities calling for a tourism boycott of the island.In an interview with the BBC, Muizzu said the Maldives is not facing a sovereign debt default, nor would it join an IMF funding program. Still, India’s backing in any potential debt restructuring is likely to prove invaluable, making a fence-mending with New Delhi all the more important, said Gulbin Sultana, associate fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a government-backed think tank in New Delhi.“Muizzu is re-balancing ties with India, as is New Delhi trying to reset its ties with the island nation,” she said.",Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is in New Delhi on his first state visit. The country's financial crisis is likely to be a key feature of discussions with New Delhi.

What's on the agenda

Improving ties



NEW DELHI: Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.As per media reports in the Maldives , Muizzu, his wife Sajidha Mohamed, and a high-level delegation of Maldivian government officials traveled on a special flight arranged by the Indian government, a gesture reserved for such visits by Maldivian presidents.Muizzu will receive an official welcome on Monday.During his visit from October 6-10, Muizzu will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and other top ministers to discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues.The president's upcoming discussions are expected to lead to several agreements that could enhance bilateral cooperation.Muizzu has been criticised for pivoting his island nation sharply towards China, and eyebrows were raised in New Delhi after he decided to break tradition by not making India his first foreign visit after taking office in November last year. Instead, he initially visited Turkey and China - a significant diplomatic shift, particularly given that his administration has been perceived as pro-China and has previously campaigned on an ""India Out"" platform.This change in approach had raised concerns about the future of India-Maldives relations, which had become strained following Muizzu's election.However, ties between the two countries have been warming up with Muizzu publicly acknowledging India's importance, referring to it as ""one of the closest allies and invaluable partners"" of the Maldives. The Maldivian president's acknowledgment of India's role in providing aid during times of need also indicates a willingness to move past contentious rhetoric towards constructive engagement.This shift could pave the way for a more balanced approach that respects Maldivian sovereignty while recognising India's strategic interests in the region.Geopolitically, the Maldives is crucial for India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative and its 'Neighbourhood First Policy'. The Maldives serves as a key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), making it strategically significant for India's national security interests.The president met EAM Jaishankar on Sunday evening shortly after landing in New Delhi.""Pleased to call on President Muizzu today at the start of his State Visit to India. Appreciate his commitment to enhance 🇮🇳 🇲🇻 relationship. Confident that his talks with PM Modi on Monday will give a new impetus to our friendly ties,"" the external affairs minister posted on X.Official talks and signing of agreements with Indian leadership are scheduled for Monday.President Muizzu will also meet with the Maldivian community living in India, on Sunday.He will also engage in business events in Mumbai and Bengaluru, highlighting the importance of economic ties between the two nations.The delegation accompanying president Muizzu includes foreign minister Dr Abdullah Khaleel, defense minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, minister of homeland security and technology Ali Ihusaan, finance minister Moosa Zameer, health minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, and economic development minister Mohamed Saeed.Other key officials joining the visit are attorney general Ahmed Usham, tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal, transport & civil aviation minister Mohamed Ameen, construction & infrastructure minister Dr Abdulla Muththalib, and chief of staff at the President's Office Abdulla Fayaz, alongside several senior officials.Muizzu last visited India in June to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit, the two leaders met and discussed strengthening bilateral relations between Maldives and India.The two leaders also met on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai in December last year.Relations between the two countries had deteriorated after two Maldivian deputy ministers made defamatory comments about PM Modi and India on social media, amid ongoing discussions about the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.The two officials, Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna were suspended from their roles in the Ministry of Youth and later resigned on September 10 this year.Withdrawal of Indian military personnel was a key pledge of President Muizzu, and the transition was carried out peacefully, with civilians replacing Indian troops as per the agreement between the two governments.Muizzu's administration has since appeared committed to mending relations with India.","Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.
