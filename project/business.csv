NIA courts

must be set up with proper infra: SC

NEW DELHI The Supreme Court has said the Centre, along with the judiciary, must devise a plan to complete trials in NIA cases within six months to prevent ""hue and cry"" over prolonged bail denial.A bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh said on Tuesday, ""We want a system committed for expeditious completion of trials, preferably in six months, so that a hue and cry over non-grant of bail (for long periods to accused) is not raised, especially in cases involving crimes against nation and public at large.""For this, dedicated NIA courts must be established with proper infrastructure, including wi-fi services, to enable appearance of accused through virtual mode and prevent unnecessary adjournments, Justice Kant said after additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati handed over a status report framed by ministry of home affairs on setting up of exclusive NIA courts. After studying the status report, the bench commended the initiative but said the process must be expedited. It told Bhati that a firm decision on the proposed plan of action must be taken on or before Dec 16, the next date of hearing.Justice Kant also told Delhi HC not to saddle the exclusive NIA courts with regular cases. The HC informed the SC that there are 50 NIA cases pending in Delhi, two in Karkardooma courts and 48 at Patiala House courts.Additional solicitor general S D Sanjay told the court that the govt is planning to set up 10-12 exclusive courts but finding space for them immediately has been difficult. The bench said the authorities must explore govt buildings for temporary accommodation of the courts till a permanent building is constructed for them.","NIA courts must be established with proper infrastructure, including wi-fi services, says CJI-designate Surya Kant.

SC: Justice Bhuyan criticises ruling; CJI Gavai refuses to give rejoinder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-justice-bhuyan-criticises-ruling-cji-gavai-refuses-to-give-rejoinder/articleshow/125423844.cms,"'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: While dissenting with CJI B R Gavai on the court's recall of the May 16 judgment of the SC authored by Justices A S Oka and him directing demolition of all structures which were granted post-facto environmental clearance, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan trained his criticism on the CJI and said the majority opinion of the court had overlooked the very fundamentals of environment jurisprudence.It was natural of Justice Bhuyan, who was part of the bench that penned the May 16 judgment, to defend the sanctity of that verdict in the face of many errors pointed out by CJI. But his statement that the CJI's judgment was ""an innocent expression of opinion"" overlooking fundamentals of environment jurisprudence raised many eyebrows, as it is widely known that Justice Gavai, as head of the green bench, has passed many judgments for the protection of environment and forests while advocating the concept of 'sustainable development'.In his 97-page counter to the CJI's 84-page recall judgment, Justice Bhuyan said, ""Precautionary principle is the cornerstone of environmental jurisprudence. 'Polluter pays' is only a principle of reparation. Precautionary principle cannot be given a short shrift by relying on the polluter pays principle. The review judgment is a step in retrogression.""After pronouncing his judgment, CJI Gavai recalled that there was a precedent in Court room no.1 for a dissenting judgment to criticise that of the CJI and the CJI responding to the dissenting view (as happened between Justice S R Bhat and CJI D Y Chandrachud in the same-sex marriage issue).""I am departing from tradition. I have not changed a single word in my judgment even after receiving the dissenting judgment (of Justice Bhuyan),"" CJI Gavai said.When Justice Bhuyan skipped reading paragraphs in his judgment criticising the CJI's view and said he ""didn't want to read certain undercurrents"", Justice Gavai encouraged him to read it and said, ""Anyway this would be in public domain. So read it.""But Justice Bhuyan was not persuaded.Justice K Vinod Chandran said he had written a separate judgment concurring with CJI only because ""the (Justice Bhuyan's) opinion rejecting the review denounces the one permitting it."" Justice Chandran said dissent is part of a healthy judicial process, but it must be practised by distancing oneself from an overbearing allegiance to one's own beliefs of right and wrong.Giving a step-by-step counter to Justice Bhuyan's judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""The judgment under review, with due respect did not look into the aspects of the power conferred under the Environment Protection Act and the legal principles regarding an undertaking given in derogation of the statutory provisions.""He added, ""I fully concur with the opinion of the Learned Chief Justice of India and find the review to be not only warranted, but imperative and expedient.""","Justice Ujjal Bhuyan said the majority opinion of the court had overlooked the very fundamentals of environment jurisprudence.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

What triggered the probe?

What did initial probe find?

About the terror-tainted University

What happened on 10/11

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday arrestedThe prime accused, Dr Umar Un Nabi, was a former student of the university located in Haryana's Faridabad.The arrest comes, hours after the ED launched raids against the Al-Falah University along with its office in Okhla and the university's promoters as initial probe had revealed discrepancies regarding UGC and NAAC recognition.The central agency conducted raids at 25 different places across the national capital, intensifying the Delhi car blast probe. Nine shell firms connected to the group, each registered at the same address, are now under scrutiny.Preliminary inquiries found out several red flags typical of shell operations, such as: No actual office space or noticeable utility usage at their listed locations; the same phone number and email ID being used for multiple companies and accounts.It was found that there had been no EPFO or ESIC filings despite the scale of business they claim; repeated overlap in directors or authorised signatories with poor KYC documentation; very limited salary payments made through formal banking channels and no HR records; and a pattern of companies being incorporated in a coordinated manner using identical contact details.Al-Falah University, which started as an engineering college in 1997 in Faridabad's Dhauj, is run by Al-Falah Charitable Trust registered in Delhi's Okhla.It became a university in 2014 after UGC recognition.The trust is headed by Jawahar Ahmed Siddiqui, who is also chancellor of the varsity. The first medicine batch began in 2019, and it now has 200 MBBS seats and 50 MD seats.Over the years, the varsity has expanded its campus from 30 acres to over 70 acres through land acquisition from local villagers.University staffers, speaking anonymously, claimed the institution receives donations from Arab countries. ""Foreign fundraisers from Arab nations visit the campus once a year. Though the college is run by a charitable trust, it has donors outside the country,"" a staff member said.The varsity charges Rs 16 lakh annually for MBBS courses, while fees for MD programmes range from Rs 2.5 lakh for anatomy to around Rs 30 lakh per year for pediatrics.At least 15 people were killed and several others injured after a powerful explosion ripped through a Hyundai i20 car near the Lal Quila Metro Station on November 10.According to preliminary post-mortem findings, the victims sustained severe injuries, including multiple fractures and head trauma.The blast wave caused extensive internal damage, rupturing lungs, eardrums, and abdominal organs, while many victims showed deep wounds and heavy bleeding, suggesting they were thrown against hard surfaces by the force of the explosion.","ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked to Al- Falah University.

Anmol Bishnoi wanted for murders, extortion

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Fugitive Anmol Bishnoi, who is wanted for the murder of NCP neta Baba Siddique, has been deported from the US. Though there was no official confirmation, sources said that he was already en route to India late on Tuesday and was likely to land in Delhi around 10am on Wednesday. The NIA is coordinating the deportation.Anmol may be one of the passengers of a special chartered flight carrying around 200 'illegals', a source said, adding two other wanted fugitives from Punjab may also be on the flight. Confirming his deportation, Zeeshan, son of late Baba Siddique, told TOI he got an official notification from US Department of Homeland Security through email, informing him that Anmol had been ""removed"" from the US.The email was sent to him through DHS-VINE, a confidential web-based system that provides notifications to registrants who have been affected by crimes committed by an illegal immigrant in US custody.With no communication from US authorities to Mumbai police about his whereabouts, Zeeshan Siddiquie had sought information from US officials. The email from the Department of Homeland Security sent to Zeeshan Siddiqui and shared with TOI said, ""This email is to inform you ANMOL BISHNOI has been removed from the United States by the federal government.The offender was removed on Nov 18, 2025.""Anmol was held in Sacramento last Nov for illegal entry after which the FBI had confirmed his identity through a DNA and voice sample match. He had sought asylum there while he was lodged at the Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa. The prison facility's website, accessed by TOI at the time, had his details uploaded and mentioned his name as Anmol Bishnoi. It said he was being investigated by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which deals with cross-border crime and undocumented immigration in the US.It was the firing incident at actor Salman Khan's house in April last year that had put Anmol under spotlight. A facebook account, purportedly of Anmol, had in April last year claimed responsibility for the shooting. Subsequently, cops chanced upon an audio recording of a conversation purportedly between Anmol and Vicky Gupta, one of the shooters involved in the incident .Subsequently, Baba Siddique was shot dead on Oct 12 last year outside the Bandra (East) office of his MLA son, Zeeshan. Anmol was named in the chargesheet filed by Mumbai police in this case. Anmol was also accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Sidhu Moosewala, who was killed on May 29, 2022. Anmol had left the country on a forged passport in the name of Bhanu Pratap in April 2024, a month before the Punjabi singer was targeted. He had since been living in California along with his associates Goldy Brar and others.In Oct 2024, National Investigation Agency had announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh on Anmol, shortly after his alleged role in Siddiquie's murder. Mumbai police had subsequently approached a court to initiate the process for Anmol's extradition and also sent a communication to the MEA through MHA. Anmol's notoriety extends to a litany of crimes, with a staggering 18 cases registered against him for a range of offences, including extortion.A resident of Fazilka in Punjab, Anmol is named in two chargesheets filed by NIA in cases registered in 2022. Last year, NIA had filed a chargesheet against a dozen individuals, including Lawrence and Anmol. The chargesheet alleged the accused were part of a larger conspiracy aimed at unleashing a reign of terror and carrying out targeted assassinations of prominent social and religious leaders, film personalities, singers, and businessmen.","Fugitive Anmol Bishnoi, who is wanted for the murder of NCP neta Baba Siddique, has been deported from the US.

NEW DELHI: In a huge relief to Union and state govts, Supreme Court on Tuesday recalled its May 16 judgment in which it had directed demolition of public projects worth Rs 20,000 crore as these were granted ex-post facto environmental clearance (EC) after payment of penalty.Steel Authority of India, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, and Karnataka govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, had sought recall of the SC judgment, which had said that despite the payment of penalty, all projects - those being executed and even those operationalised - must be stopped and demolished.A bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ujjal Bhuyan by a 2-1 majority agreed to recall the judgment. CJI Gavai, in the majority view, said if the judgment is not recalled, it will result in demolition of buildings or projects constructed with Rs 20,000 crore of public exchequer money. AIIMS in Odisha, and a greenfield airport in Karnataka were among the projects cited by the CJI.The Chief Justice cited three such projects - AIIMS in Odisha, a greenfield airport in Karnataka, and a huge effluent treatment plant. Apart from this, CREDAI had pointed out that several of its projects also faced a similar fate.CJI Gavai said the May 16 judgment suffered from a dichotomy as, on the one hand, it had allowed mining companies to suspend their operations and seek post-facto environmental clearance (EC) and resume operations after paying compensation, while, on the other, it faulted ex-post facto EC to public projects and ordered their demolition.The solicitor general placed before SC details of 24 central projects worth Rs 8,293 crore pending for approval and another 29 projects worth Rs 11,169 crore in states languishing for lack of approval. Mehta said all these projects have got EIA (environmental impact assessment) clearance and are awaiting final environmental clearance.Because of an SC stay on Jan 2, 2024, environmental clearance could not be granted to these projects. If these projects, nearing completion, are demolished just because they were given ex-post facto EC, it would have a devastating impact on public interest and the exchequer, he said.CJI Gavai weighed the question: ""Whether it would be in the public interest to demolish all such projects and permit the money spent from the pocket of the public exchequer to go in the dustbin?""Justice Gavai said, ""If the judgment under review is not recalled, it will have serious consequences in terms of demolition of projects which are either completed or about to be completed soon and which are of vital public importance constructed out of the public exchequer... and thousands of crores of rupees would go in waste."" Demolition of a large number of buildings would also create more pollution, he added.Justice Bhuyan, who was part of the bench presided by Justice A S Oka which had authored the May 16 judgment, dissented and said the verdict does not warrant interference.Criticising CJI Gavai's opinion as an innocent one overlooking the fundamentals of environment jurisprudence, he said, ""Precautionary principle is the cornerstone of environmental jurisprudence. 'Polluter pays' is only a principle of reparation. Precautionary principle cannot be given a short shrift by relying on polluter pays principle. The review judgment is a step in retrogression.""","Supreme Court on Tuesday recalled its May 16 judgment in which it had directed demolition of public projects worth Rs 20,000 crore. A bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ujjal Bhuyan by a 2-1 majority agreed to recall the judgment. Steel Authority of India, and Karnataka govt, had sought recall of the SC judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125421688,imgsize-1301297,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

New Delhi: India’s celebrated astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla said with a smile on Tuesday that the “homework given by PM Narendra Modi 'pura hua hai, chal raha hai, aur badta hi ja raha hai' (has been completed, yet it is still going on as the scope of the homework is increasing by the day)”. On a serious note, Shux said that results of the seven Isro-devised microgravity experiments conducted by him on ISS during his 18-day stay there are being analysed after samples of his work have come back to Earth in batches, and that learnings from his ISS mission are being used for Gaganyaan planning.Speaking on the sidelines of India International Space Conclave organised by Indian Space Association (ISpA) here, Shukla told TOI, “For me, bigger learning from the seven experiments has been how to conduct these tests in space because it is easy to conduct such experiments on Earth, but difficult to do them there. Whatever experience I gained on ISS, we have made a template of that. We are now comparing what we were doing earlier (in Gaganyaan programme) with what is happening now, to identify the gaps. ”On progress on India’s spaceflight mission, Shux said, “Gaganyaan is a developmental programme — training and development are happening together. As per my knowledge, Gaganyaan-G1 (uncrewed mission) will be conducted early next year and Gaganyaan-G2 (uncrewed mission with humanoid Vyommitra) will be in early 2027.”Shux said he has shared his ISS experiences with three other Indian astronaut-candidates — Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, Ajit Krishnan and Angad Pratap — as they have been training together. Shux, who is also a seasoned IAF test pilot, said, “As part of our training, I have to go back to flying fighter jets, which I will do in December.”He said, “When you cross the boundary of space (Karman line), you are given a number, and I was No. 634, which is not a top number to remember”. But when I came back, kids told me: “We didn't know that there was an ISS in space before you went. We cared because you were there.”Urging the youth to dream big, he added, “We are in the golden age as far as space exploration is concerned. I want all youngsters to be focused and contribute to the space sector actively. Every boy or girl of India who dreams of becoming an astronaut can realise their dream in today's India. We have established extremely ambitious goals — Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035, human landing on Moon by 2040 and Viksit Bharat by 2047 — but for us to achieve that, all of us have to be active participants. Sky was never the limit. Not for me, not for you and not for Bharat.”Space minister Jitendra Singh, who was the chief guest at the conference, said, “Space reforms in the last five years have been a turning point. Earlier, our space economy was dispersed and was not even considered a part of the economy. Today, the Indian space economy is worth $8 billion and the pace at which it is moving, the projection is that in the next 10 years, it will go up to $44-45 billion. In times to come, space is going to be an important contributor to the growth of India's economy as we move up the ranks. ”",Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla said results of the seven microgravity experiments conducted by him during his 18-day stay there are being analysed.

He added that once the entire Ahmadabad-Mumbai bullet train corridor is operational, the train will cover the stretch in less than two hours.The announcements came barely days after PM Narendra Modi visited Surat station.Earlier, Vaishnaw had said that the inaugural run would be on a 50 km stretch between Surat and Billimore. The minister’s new statement is being seen as an indication of the increased pace of progress.Vaishnaw told reporters, “The bullet train will cover the distance between Mumbai and Ahmedabad in one-hour-and-58 minutes while stopping at four stations. However, if it stops at all 12 stations, the entire distance will be covered in 2 hours and 17 minutes.” The entire project is likely to be completed in 2029.Despite the new commitment to the bullet train’s inaugural run, there is a lack of clarity on whether a Japanese Shinkansen or Indian made high speed train will operate on its first run.The country’s first 508-km long high-speed rail corridor is being constructed between Sabarmati (Ahmedabad) and Mumbai to operate a bullet train at 320 kmph. The foundation stone for the project was laid in 2017 and was initially planned to be ready by Dec 2023. However, land acquisition, forest clearance and other issues delayed the project.On Modi’s recent visit, the minister said the PM was happy with the pace of progress. “He said that whatever we have learnt from the project must be used elsewhere, not only in railways and other high speed projects, but in other different sectors as well. We have done one innovation after the other in this project. It is a complex project and the biggest challenge was its design,” Vaishnaw said.","India’s first bullet train will now cover a 100-km distance between Surat and Vapi in Gujarat during its inaugural run in August 2027.

NEW DELHI: India slipped 13 ranks to figure at the 23rd position in the latest Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), which was released by environmental think tank Germanwatch on the sidelines of the ongoing UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil on Tuesday.It’s the biggest fall of India on the CCPI ranking in the recent past even as it remained in the top 10 high-performing countries for six years in a row till 2024. India, which ranked 31st in 2014, entered the top 10 list for the first time in 2019.The annual CCPI uses a standardised framework to compare the climate performance of 63 countries and the EU, which put together, account for over 90% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The performance of countries is assessed in four categories — GHG emission, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy.India, in fact, is one of the biggest fallers in this year’s ranking despite performing well above global average in terms of increasing its renewable energy footprints. The country has, for instance, made substantial progress, achieving nearly 14% share of renewables in its total energy mix from 2015 to 2023.Besides, its non-fossil sources of energy now account for more than half of the country’s total electric power installed capacity (currently around 256 GW).What’s the reason behind India’s fall in the ranking? One of the authors of CCPI, Jan Burck of Germanwatch, attributed the decline to a combination of factors, including the steadily rising trend of the country’s GHG emissions in recent years. India, in fact, ranked last in terms of emission trends.“At the same time, energy consumption is increasing. India has also lost many places in climate policy rankings mainly due to its lack of a plan to phase out coal or even a concrete phase-out date. If India will reduce the building of new coal power plants and continue the promising trend for renewables, the country can achieve a much better ranking again next year,” said Burck.Denmark, the UK and Morocco took the lead in this year’s CCPI as fourth, fifth and sixth rankers in the list with the top three ranks remaining vacant like the previous years in absence of a perfect score to any country.China (54th), Russia (64th), the US (65th) and Saudi Arabia (67th) are the G20’s worst-performing countries, receiving an overall very low score. With Iran at 66th rank, Russia, the US and Saudi Arabia are the four last-placed countries in CCPI.Published annually by the Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network since 2005, the CCPI tracks countries’ efforts to combat climate change. It serves as an independent tool that tracks the climate mitigation performance of 63 countries and the EU. “It aims to enhance transparency in international climate politics and enables comparison of climate mitigation efforts and progress made by individual countries,” said the CCPI 2026 report.","India slipped 13 ranks to figure at the 23rd position in the latest Climate Change Performance Index.

Simultaneously, the govt on Tuesday launched an online platform that allows beneficiaries to share their feedback on ration distribution through AI-enabled calls in their preferred language.Confirming the deletion of ineligible beneficiaries, food secretary Sanjeev Chopra said the exercise has been undertaken to ensure better targeting of “rightful” beneficiaries while eligible beneficiaries are being added to the scheme by state govts.Officials said the food and public distribution department at the Centre identified the ineligible beneficiaries on parameters such as deceased, income tax payee, govt service, four-wheeler ownership and directors of entities. The list was shared with state govts for verification and then deletion of names.To ensure that beneficiaries are getting the right quality of foodgrain and are not being charged, food and consumer affairs minister Pralhad Joshi launched the Anna Sahayata Holistic AI Solution (Asha) to collect direct beneficiary feedback on ration quantity, quality and payment-related issues.The system uses multilingual translation, sentiment analysis, automated grievance categorisation and real-time dashboards for administrators.The platform will “enable us to get granular sentiment insights up to the ration shop level for strengthening data-driven decision-making under the food security scheme,” said an official.The food secretary said Rs 5 lakh will be spent every month for this operation and added that the cost would have been much higher if done through call centres.","Over two crore ineligible beneficiaries have been weeded out from free foodgrain scheme PMGKAY.

EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?

NEW DELHI: Turning the pressure back on rich nations ahead of making its new 2035 climate action pledges, India has urged developed countries to demonstrate their own greater climate ambition and honour their commitments, underlining the need to reach ‘net zero’ emission by them earlier than 2050.India will submit its new climate action pledges — nationally determined contribution (NDC) — to the UN body next month. So far, more than 100 countries, including the US, China and the EU, have already submitted their NDCs with many stakeholders, asking India to deliver an ambitious mitigation target.“Developed countries must reach ‘net zero’ far earlier than current target dates, fulfil their obligations under Article 9.1 (providing climate finance by developed countries to assist developing ones) of the Paris Agreement, and deliver new, additional, and concessional climate finance estimated to be in trillions of dollars,” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday while delivering India’s national statement at the ongoing UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil.Yadav articulated India’s consistent position where it wants wealthy nations to be ambitious in their climate action as they, being the historical emitters, are responsible for climate change whereas the countries in the Global South suffer more.His remarks on “trillions of dollars” reflect the Global South’s demand to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 by rich nations to assist developing countries instead of what was agreed ($300 billion annually by 2035) amid serious concerns during COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, last year.Asking rich nations to deliver, the minister, on the occasion, flagged how India has already demonstrated successfully that development and environmental stewardship can advance in tandem, and fulfilled all its climate action promises much in advance.“India’s emission intensity has declined by over 36% since 2005. India’s non-fossil fuel based energy capacity, currently around 256 GW, accounts for more than half of its total electric installed capacity — an NDC target achieved five years ahead of the schedule,” said Yadav.He also noted that the country’s newly launched Nuclear Mission and Green Hydrogen Mission further accelerate its journey towards ‘net zero’ by 2070.The Brazilian Presidency, meanwhile, on Tuesday released a new set of draft texts — Mutirao Mobilization/Belem Package — incorporating all suggestions on the negotiation table on contentious issues, including finance, mitigation and unilateral trade measures, and an overall COP30 decision mechanism. Negotiators will try to thrash out their differences over the next three days to come out with a final decision of COP30.","India will submit its new climate action pledges to the UN body next month.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that genuine emotional commitment to public welfare is what helps in winning elections.Speaking at the sixth Ramnath Goenka Lecture in New Delhi, he said that leaders must work with genuine emotion rather than remain in a permanent political campaign. PM Modi dismissed claims that he and the BJP operate in a “24×7 election mode”, saying the party wins because it is driven by an emotional commitment to public welfare. “After winning the Bihar election, some people, including some Modi admirers in the media, have once again started saying that the BJP and Modi always remain in a 24×7 election mode. I believe that to win elections, being in election mode is not necessary; what is necessary is to remain in an emotional mode 24×7,” he said.He added that governance must be rooted in empathy and urgency. “When there is restlessness within the heart then not even a single minute should be wasted and one must keep working to reduce the hardships of the poor, to provide employment to the poor, to give healthcare to the poor, to fulfil the aspirations of the middle class. One should work tirelessly.” According to him, such emotion ensures that “the results become visible on the day of the elections,” a lesson he said was evident in the Bihar mandate.PM Modi said that the Bihar results underline the public’s rising expectations. “The results of the Bihar elections have once again taught a lesson on the high aspirations and ambitions of the people of India. The people of India today trust those political parties who have good intentions and fulfil the aspirations of the people and prioritise development,” he said.He urged states to treat development as their primary responsibility and engage in healthy competition. “I strongly encourage state governments to foster a spirit of healthy competition by attracting investments and promoting growth. Organising competitions to improve the ease of doing business could be a great step in this direction,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also framed India’s economic resilience as a source of global optimism. “Our GDP is growing at nearly seven per cent despite global instabilities; India is not just an emerging market but an emerging model too,” he said, adding that “India is restless to become a developed nation”.",Narendra Modi says leaders must work with genuine emotion rather than remain in a permanent political campaign.

He emphasised that the party needs to counter this 'politically, organisationally and legally, as per sources, quoted by PTI.Rahul noted that while the Election Commission should ensure accurate electoral rolls, it appeared to be shifting responsibility to political parties, according to the PTI sources. He questioned the implementation of the procedure, alleging it could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.Other Congress leaders also expressed their opposition to SIR, invoking their 'vote-chori' claim again or calling it a 'sinister attempt to destroy Democracy"".The review meeting included Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , Gandhi, and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, along with state unit chiefs, CLP leaders and secretaries from the regions undergoing Special Intensive Revision.Congress has intensified its 'vote chori' stance, criticising the Election Commission's handling of the SIR process as ""deeply disappointing"" and called for the commission to prove its independence from BJP influence.Kharge, who led the meeting, accused the BJP of using the process as a tool for ""vote chori"". He said on X, ""We held a comprehensive strategy review with AICC general secretaries, AICC in-charges, PCCs, CLPs and AICC secretaries from the states/UTs where the SIR process is underway.

"Indian-origin CEO in US, killed in 2019, made employees do 500 pushups for paychecks: Suspect tells jury",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-ceo-in-us-killed-in-2019-made-employees-do-500-pushups-for-paychecks-suspect-tells-jury/articleshow/125414717.cms,"Indian-origin CEO Tushar Atre was kidnapped and killed in California in 2019.



How Tushar Atre was kidnapped and murdered





Tushar Atre, a 50-year-old Indian-origin CEO and a cannabis entrepreneur who was kidnapped and killed in 2019, allegedly made his employees do 500 pushups for their paychecks, a suspected killer told the jury as the trial of the murder is going on. 23-year-old Joshua Camps, 22-year-old Kurtis Charters, 22-year-old Stephen Lindsay and 19-year-old Kaleb Charters, brother of Kurtis, were arrested soon after Atre was found murdered on a property in the Santa Cruz Mountains.Kurtis and Lindsay were convicted earlier this year of first-degree murder in separate trials.Kaleb's trial started this month, according to local reports, and he told the jury that he worked at Atre's cannabis farm for 10 days in August 2019. But they had to work from dawn to dusk on an agreed rate of $200 per day.Lindsy and Kaleb left the work after 10 days when Atre found that one of the keys to his farm trucks was missing and he bounced the checks. Kaleb told the jury earlier this month that Atre humiliated them over the incident and called it a waste of time. The key was found later and Atre agreed to make a fresh payment of $1400 since the earlier checks bounced but only if they do 500 pushups.Kaleb told the jury that the amount was $600 less than the $2,000 the workers were expecting for a 10-day work period.Several of Atre's former employees have now testified that the multimillionaire boss had created a hostile, fear-based work environment where Atre used to withhold payment, yell at them and fire them.Several assailants broke into Atre's coastal estate and he was seen taken inside a white BMW. Hours later, his body was found at one of his properties in the Santa Cruz Mountains. He had been stabbed and then kidnapped, and then shot dead. Police said it was Lindsay and Kaleb who planned a robbery weeks after they left their work. They contacted a friend with a gun and cracked Atre's security code. The original plan was a robbery but it was reported at that time that the attempt turned into chaos as Atre started running when they broke in his house. They stabbed and shot him and then took him to his another house and left him to die.Atre was the founder and CEO of a corporate marketing firm, AtreNet, and Interstitial Systems, a cannabis company with a marijuana farm and laboratory in the Santa Cruz region.","Tushar Atre, a 50-year-old Indian-origin CEO and a cannabis entrepreneur who was kidnapped and killed in 2019, allegedly made his employees do 500 pushups for their paychecks.

Anmol Bishnoi, Accused In Baba Siddique Murder Case, To Be Deported To India From US

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: “This email is to inform you ANMOL BISHNOI has been removed from the United States by the federal government.”The one-line intimation from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), sent through its confidential DHS-VINE notification system, was the first confirmation for Zeeshan Siddique — son of slain NCP leader Baba Siddique — that the fugitive wanted for his father’s murder had been deported.Sources said there is still no official announcement, but Anmol is expected to land in Delhi around 10am on Wednesday, with the NIA coordinating the deportation. He is believed to be travelling on a chartered flight carrying around 200 “illegals”, and two other wanted fugitives from Punjab may also be on board.Zeeshan said he approached US authorities after receiving no update from Mumbai Police on Anmol’s whereabouts. DHS’s email informed him that the gangster, arrested in the US last November, had been “removed” on November 18, 2025.Anmol was held in Sacramento last year for illegal entry. His identity was later confirmed by the FBI through DNA and voice sample matches. While lodged at the Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa, he had sought asylum. The prison website at the time listed his details and showed he was under investigation by ICE, the agency that handles cross-border crime and undocumented immigrants.Anmol, a resident of Fazilka, Punjab, is wanted in multiple major cases. His name surfaced prominently after the April 2024 firing at actor Salman Khan’s Bandra home, with a Facebook account, purportedly his, claiming responsibility. Police also recovered an audio clip of a conversation allegedly between him and shooter Vicky Gupta.On October 12 last year, NCP leader Baba Siddique was shot dead outside the Bandra (East) office of his MLA son. Anmol was named in the Mumbai Police chargesheet. He is also accused of supplying weapons and logistics to the killers of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala in 2022.Anmol left India in April 2024 on a forged passport in the name of Bhanu Pratap and had been living in California with associates, including Goldy Brar. In October 2024, NIA announced a Rs 10 lakh reward for information on him. Mumbai Police then moved court to begin the extradition process and also wrote to MEA through MHA.His criminal record spans 18 cases, including extortion. He is also named in two NIA chargesheets filed in 2022. Last year, NIA chargesheeted him alongside Lawrence Bishnoi and several others for allegedly being part of a wider conspiracy to carry out targeted assassinations of political, religious and entertainment figures.As he is flown back, Indian agencies are preparing for what could be one of the most significant handovers linked to organised crime and high-profile targeted killings in recent years.","Anmol Bishnoi, Accused In Baba Siddique Murder Case, To Be Deported To India From US.

Cloudflare down: OpenAI, Twitter, Spotify, Canva, Claude and other big businesses that Cloudflare outage 'disrupted'

I won’t mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in @Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us. The sites, businesses, and organizations that rely on Cloudflare depend on us being available and I apologize for the impact that we caused.

Transparency about what happened matters, and we plan to share a breakdown with more details in a few hours. In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack.

That issue, impact it caused, and time to resolution is unacceptable. Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today. The trust our customers place in us is what we value the most and we are going to do what it takes to earn that back.

Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht confirmed that the technical problems have been addressed. The internet infrastructure provider deployed its corrective measures that prompted affected services to begin returning to normal operation shortly thereafter. While the primary issues have been resolved, Cloudflare continues to actively monitor the situation and has indicated that users may still experience occasional difficulties.In a long post on X (formerly Twitter), Knecht apologised for the outage, saying that a bug caused a cascade of failures, rendering hundreds of websites offline.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Kate Middleton's appeal to business leaders





Princess Kate Middleton delivered her first public speech in two years at the Future Workforce Summit in London.

She said that a child’s earliest years have a lasting impact on adult life and described love and stable relationships as factors that contribute to resilience and wellbeing.Kate urged business leaders to balance financial goals with policies that support families and caregiving.

Visa Breach Ends India Visit for Blacklisted UK Scholar and Hindi Literature Expert Francesca Orsini





: PoK-origin UK home secretary Shabana Mahmood announced Monday that Trump-style visa bans will be imposed on countries unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants, as she revealed further sweeping reforms to tackle illegal immigration.The first countries to face such a ban are Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo whose nationals will no longer be granted UK visas unless their govts rapidly improve cooperation on removals. “These countries face penalties for their unacceptably low co-operation and obstructive returns processes. Thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from these nations are currently in the UK,” the home office said.Non-cooperation includes embassies failing to process removals paperwork in time and requiring individuals to sign their own documentation — allowing them to block their own deportation.India is thought to be one of several other countries most resistant to taking back illegal migrants and could join the list over the coming year, the Times (UK) reported.Human rights laws will also be overhauled to scale up deportations and prevent migrants from “gaming the system”.UK’s govt will legislate to reform how Article 8 (the right to family and private life) is interpreted by the courts to make clear a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child — blocking people from using dubious connections to stay in the UK. It will also work with partners at the Council of Europe to address the “over-expansive application” of Article 3 (protection against inhuman and degrading treatments) which migrants are also using to block their removal and introduce new legislation to crack down on “migrants making last-minute bogus modern slavery claims”. Migrants will be restricted to arguing all legal grounds within a single appeal and, if they lose, they will be forced to leave.New capped work and study routes for genuine refugees will be created who will be referred through partners such as the UNHCR. British people will be encouraged to house them, as they have done for Ukrainians, to end the reliance on asylum hotels, which cost £2.1 billion in 2024-2025.In the year ending June 2025 a total of 5,475 Indian nationals claimed asylum in the UK making them the sixth-largest nationality. Of these, 346 Indians arrived by small boat illegally. The other Indians were mostly on visas, with student visas being the most common. The top nationality to claim asylum was Pakistani; followed by nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Bangladesh.Only 20 Indians were granted asylum in the year ending June 2025, and 2,691 had their claims refused.","Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will face visa bans unless they accept the return of their criminals and illegal immigrants.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

What is public charge ?





The Donald Trump administration has been working to shake up an immigration policy that could deny lawful immigrants their desired green card if the immigration officials decide that they are going to become dependent on the state. The Department of Homeland Security has moved to change the public charge rule which has been in place since December 2022.DHS plans to expand the public charge policy that would lower the threshold for being deemed likely to depend on the government. According to reports, the rule will formally be proposed on November 19 and will be open for public feedback for 30 days.Public charge is the factors that make one immigrant dependent on the government. It is a ground of inadmissibility. The Immigration and Nationality Act does not define “public charge” but requires a totality test of certain factors to determine if a foreign national is likely to become a public charge of the government. If deemed likely, the government can deny the immigration benefit or status sought by the foreign national.Currently, the public charge factors are age, health, family status, assets, resources, and financial status; education and skills and factors defined in regulations or policy (currently, the foreign national’s receipt of certain public benefits, and in some cases, a Form I-864 Affidavit of Support).If this is expanded, the chances of getting rejected for a green card will also increase. For example, under the proposed approach, DHS officers would be required to weigh the ""totality of the circumstances,"" including family health history and economic background, with fewer specific guidelines.The proposed changes are motivated by what the Trump administration believes -- that government benefits should not encourage immigration.The change would ffectively hand more powers to Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to decide who they believe could become a ""public charge,"" according to Politico.","DHS plans to expand the public charge policy that would lower the threshold for being deemed likely to depend on the government.

President Donald Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett predicted a 'quiet time' in the labor market and said companies won't have to hire ""the new kids out of college"" as firms are largely depending on AIs. Social media users pointed out that the population whom he called new kids are reeling under frustration because they are unemployed.“There could be a little bit of, almost, quiet time in the labor market, because firms are finding that AI is making their workers so productive that they don’t necessarily have to hire the new kids out of college and so on,"" Hassett said, assuring that AI-induced softness in the market would be temporary.The comment came amid a fresh MAGA civil war over H-1B, the visa program that allows US tech companies to hire skilled foreigners. The Donald Trump administration announced a $100,000 fee for fresh hiring of H-1Bs sending a strong signal against foreigners stealing American jobs, but the signal got mixed when Donald Trump, in a FOX interview, said America needs certain talents from foreign countries.In the FOX interview, Trump cited the example of Korean battery workers and said that kind of expertise is needed in America.""You don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn. You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say 'I’m gonna put you into a factory and we’re going to make missiles,'"" he said.He elaborated on his H-1B comment Monday and clarified that America needs certain talents until Americans learn those. For example, Trump cited chip-making skill which he said America allowed Taiwan to take.Republican Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are against H-1B. Greene announced a bill to end the H-1B program altogether before her major fallout with Trump took place. Ron DeSantis already banned H-1B in Florida universities.

Federal investigation and charges

Outcome, sentencing and exoneration

Implications for space law and public perception





A long-running and highly publicised legal saga once promoted as the world’s first “space crime” has reached a definitive conclusion after Summer Heather Worden, the estranged partner of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators. Worden admitted fabricating claims that McClain accessed her bank account from the International Space Station in 2019, an allegation that dominated global headlines and overshadowed McClain’s career for years.The allegations emerged in 2019 during a bitter separation between the couple. Worden accused McClain of identity theft, saying the astronaut accessed her personal bank account while on a mission aboard the ISS. As investigations began, the claim was widely reported as the first crime ever allegedly committed from space, generating intense public curiosity and media coverage.Federal authorities soon uncovered contradictions in Worden’s account. Investigators established that McClain had been granted access to the bank account years earlier as part of the couple’s shared financial arrangements. There was no evidence of wrongdoing, misuse or unauthorised access.Instead, Worden was found to have lied about when the account was opened and when she changed the login credentials.Worden’s allegations triggered inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission and NASA’s Office of Inspector General. As evidence accumulated, the narrative shifted. In an indictment unsealed in 2020, prosecutors charged Worden with two counts of making false statements to federal investigators after determining that key details in her accusations had been intentionally fabricated.In November 2025, Worden pleaded guilty in federal court, formally admitting to providing false information. The plea brought an end to more than six years of speculation, scrutiny and international reporting.With the guilty plea now entered, Worden faces a potential sentence of up to five years in federal prison and a fine of up to 250,000 dollars. Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 2026.For Anne McClain, the resolution marks the end of a lengthy ordeal. McClain, a decorated Army aviator and NASA astronaut, consistently denied any wrongdoing and maintained that she had legitimate access to the account.She has since continued her distinguished career, including commanding NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission to the ISS in 2025.Although grounded in a personal dispute, the case had broader implications. The high-profile allegation prompted widespread discussion about legal jurisdiction in space and the regulatory frameworks that govern astronaut conduct beyond Earth. Ultimately, the investigation underscored the importance of thorough verification before drawing conclusions in cases involving new technological frontiers.","Summer Heather Worden, the estranged partner of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators.

Trump rolls out red carpet for MBS as US takes to green flags,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-mbs-as-us-takes-to-green-flags/articleshow/125417105.cms,"The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Boost For Saudi Airpower; Trump Says U.S. Will Sell F-35 Aircraft To Riyadh Despite Israeli Concerns





Green energy may be out of favor in the United States but green flags are back in red-blooded America. MAGA Supremo Donald Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) on Tuesday, rehabilitating a leader long shunned over the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and recasting US relations in the region amid Washington's increasingly rickety ties with India.A ceremonial welcome on the White House South Lawn festooned with green Saudi flags alongside stars and stripes, a military flyover, and a black-tie dinner later in the evening marked MBS’ return to the US capital after a seven year hiatus, signaling not just a diplomatic thaw but a full-scale strategic reset, elevating Riyadh to the center of the administration’s economic and geopolitical agenda.The visit comes weeks after Trump effected a similar, if less ostentatious and quieter recalibration with Pakistan, which signed a Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement (SMDA) involving nuclear protection with the Saudis two months ago, with no pushback from Washington, and perhaps with its blessings.At the heart of the MBS visit, coming in the midst of a furor in the capital over the Epstein files, is a raft of business deals securing billions in arms sales, accelerating civil nuclear cooperation, and solidifying Saudi Arabia’s $600-billion U.S. investment pledge. White House officials framed the visit as a moment to lock in F-35 fighter jet sales, expand artificial-intelligence partnerships, and deepen defense integration — priorities Trump says bolster America’s economic revival.It was also an unmistakable show of personal diplomacy, reflecting the Trump family’s long-standing ties to the Saudi leadership.But the spectacle could not fully eclipse the shadow of Khashoggi murder in Istanbul in 2018, which U.S. intelligence concluded MBS approved. Human rights groups, liberal lawmakers, and major media outlets condemned the warm reception as a moral retreat, with critics excoriating the administration for normalizing a leader accused of grave abuses. Trump brushed off the moral brigade, calling Saudi Arabia an “indispensable partner” against Iran and “a crucial market” he would be “a fool” to disregard.The visit also spotlights deeper regional resets and recalibrations in a region where renewed U.S.–Saudi axis intersects with Pakistan and India in complicated ways.For decades, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have shared deep military and financial ties. Trump’s outreach to both countries — coupled with MBS’s expanded investment in Pakistan and Pakistan's rehabilitation in Washington — has fueled perceptions of a U.S. tilt that sidelines India, despite New Delhi’s centrality to the Quad and U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. Tariff tensions with India have exacerbated the rift, despite the imminence of a trade deal and a much talked-up personal relationship between Trump and Modi. India in turn is recalibrating ties with China and moving closer to Israel.In recent years, India has also developed close ties with Riyadh although that has been undercut by the Saudi-Pak mutual defense pact. In fact, ahead of the MBS visit to Washington, New Delhi announced a major energy shift, securing a landmark deal to buy 2.2 million tonnes of U.S. liquefied petroleum gas. The agreement, representing about 10% of India’s annual LPG imports, is a significant pivot away from Gulf suppliers, including Saudi Arabia.Eventually, MBS’s visit reflects a world where every country is jostling to advance its interests in transactional ways, with human rights concerns and democratic values taking a back seat.","Donald Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) on Tuesday, rehabilitating a leader long shunned over the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The visit comes weeks after Trump effected a similar, if less ostentatious and quieter recalibration with Pakistan, which signed a Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement (SMDA) involving nuclear protection with the Saudis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125417153,imgsize-680923,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The India connection



Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.
