"Delhi at 66%, but only 22% deaths nationwide have certified cause",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-at-66-but-only-22-deaths-nationwide-have-certified-cause/articleshow/128289081.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi reports relatively strong medical certification of deaths, the national picture remains stark — only 22% of registered deaths in India were medically certified in 2023, exposing a serious gap in how the country tracks disease trends and plans health policy.The concern was flagged at a two-day National Symposium on Strengthening Mortality Information Systems held in the capital, which concluded on February 11. Experts warned that despite years of reform efforts, large sections of India’s death data remain incomplete.Latest Civil Registration data reveal sharp disparities across States and Union Territories. Delhi recorded 66% of registered deaths as medically certified, placing it among the better-performing regions. Goa (100%), Lakshadweep (99.2%) and Puducherry (91.4%) have near-universal certification, while Chandigarh (76.4%) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (67.2%) also report high coverage. In contrast, several large states lag significantly — Maharashtra (42.4%), Tamil Nadu (39.1%), Telangana (38.4%), Karnataka (26.7%), Odisha (23.4%) and Gujarat (23.3%) — pulling the national average down to 22%.Dr Harshal Ramesh Salve of AIIMS told TOI that barely 1 in 5 deaths nationally undergo proper medical certification of cause.A substantial proportion of deaths — particularly in rural areas — occur outside health facilities, where formal certification is often absent.Inaugurating the symposium, Dr V K Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, stressed that robust and interoperable mortality systems are essential for evidence-based governance. He said health planning must be driven by reliable, real-time data and underscored the need for coordinated action across sectors to ensure that every death is counted and its cause scientifically determined.Experts said counting every death and accurately recording its cause is critical for estimating disease burden, identifying risk factors and designing prevention strategies. Without reliable cause-of-death data, health planning risks relying on projections rather than evidence. Stronger data sharing between ORGI, the health ministry and academic institutions, they added, would help generate science-driven, decentralised policies and improve India’s self-reliance in disease estimation.Over the past decade, AIIMS and the Office of the Registrar General of India strengthened surveillance through verbal autopsy and digital systems. More than 10 lakh cases were reviewed, and over 4 lakh deaths were assigned a probable cause, with about 1,000 trained doctors engaged across 27 institutes. However, much of this supports sample-based surveillance rather than universal coverage. With nearly 1 crore deaths reported annually, comprehensive certification remains a work in progress.Verbal autopsy is used mainly when a person dies outside a hospital. It involves interviewing family members about symptoms and circumstances before death, after which trained doctors assign the most likely cause using standard medical classification systems. While it improves national estimates, experts say expanding routine medical certification of deaths in hospitals and communities remains essential.The symposium concluded with the launch of a National Consortium for Strengthening Mortality Data Systems to improve data quality, expand certification and accelerate digital integration nationwide.Public health experts said that while Delhi’s 66% certification rate reflects progress, the national gap underscores the urgency of ensuring that every death — and its cause — is systematically recorded.","Latest Civil Registration data reveal sharp disparities across States and Union Territories.

"FOGSI seeks rollback of NEET-PG percentile cuts, flags ‘pay-to-enter’ risk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fogsi-seeks-rollback-of-neet-pg-percentile-cuts-flags-pay-to-enter-risk/articleshow/128289362.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), representing clinicians and academicians committed to maintaining high standards in medical education and patient care, has sought an immediate review and withdrawal of repeated reductions in the NEET-PG qualifying percentile.In a statement issued on February 11, FOGSI expressed serious concern that lowering the qualifying threshold in a national merit-based examination dilutes meritocracy and compromises academic rigour, raising concerns about the quality of specialist training and patient safety.The body urged the National Medical Commission, particularly its Postgraduate Medical Education Board, to urgently revisit the policy.FOGSI pointed out that the NEET-PG Information Bulletin already lays down a structured and transparent algorithm for filling vacant seats, including category conversion and sequential counselling rounds. These mechanisms, it said, must be strictly followed and exhausted before any lowering of qualifying standards is considered.Addressing the issue of vacant seats, the federation said the root cause is not lack of merit but “highly irrational and unaffordable” fee structures in several private and deemed universities.With postgraduate fees running from tens of lakhs to several crores, specialist education risks turning into a “pay-to-enter” system where financial capacity outweighs competence.“Postgraduate medical education is not merely about seat occupancy; it is about training competent specialists who will serve the nation for decades,” the statement said, adding that dilution of entry standards alongside unchecked commercialisation threatens academic excellence, professional dignity and public trust.FOGSI called upon authorities to withdraw repeated percentile reductions, ensure strict adherence to counselling and seat-conversion rules, initiate urgent rationalisation and regulation of postgraduate fee structures, and engage specialty societies and academic stakeholders before implementing policy changes with long-term consequences.The federation reiterated its commitment to safeguarding merit, affordability and the integrity of medical education in the larger interest of patients and public health.","The Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) has sought an immediate review and withdrawal of repeated reductions in the NEET-PG qualifying percentile.

Rera only facilitating builders in default: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rera-only-facilitating-builders-in-default-sc/articleshow/128284797.cms,"Better Abolish It: Bench At Hearing On HP Office Shift

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it is high time all states rethought the constitution of the real estate regulatory authority (Rera) as the institution is doing nothing except “facilitating” defaulting builders.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the people for whom Rera was created were “completely disappointed”. “Better abolish this institution, we don’t mind that,” the CJI said. The observations came as the bench permitted the Himachal govt to shift the Rera office to a place of its choice.“...High time that all the states should revisit and rethink of even constituting this authority,” the bench said.When the bench was informed that a retired IAS officer was appointed in Rera, the CJI said, “In every state, it has become a rehabilitation centre. These authorities are all occupied by these persons.”The advocate general of Himachal told the bench that, as per a policy decision, the state is developing Palampur, Dharamshala and other cities.The CJI asked, “What is the logic of having a retired bureaucrat? How he will be able to help in developing Palampur? You need to avail services of some architect who is environment friendly, knows Palampur, Dharamshala and these areas.Only those persons will help”.The bench issued notice on a plea filed by Himachal Pradesh govt and others challenging an order of the high court in a matter pertaining to the shifting of the state Rera office from Shimla to Dharamshala. The HC had earlier stayed a June 2025 notification concerning the shifting of the Rera office till further order. Later, in its order on Dec 30, 2025, the court directed the continuance of the interim order. The top court stayed the HC’s Dec 30 direction.In its plea filed in the top court through advocate Sugandha Anand, the state said the decision to shift the office was taken to “decongest” Shimla, and it was purely on administrative considerations. An advocate, appearing for the respondent, said 90% of the projects with which the authority deals are in Shimla, Solan, Parwanoo and Sirmaur, which are within a radius of a maximum of 40km. He said about 92% of complaints pending before Rera are from these districts; only 20 projects are in Dharamshala.“The people for whom this institution was created, they are completely depressed, disgusted and disappointed. None of them are getting any effective relief. For whom this institution actually is now serving, you will find out when you meet these people,” the bench said.The top court also observed that Shimla is “completely over exhausted”. Issuing notice on the plea, the bench said, “The state is permitted to shift the office of Rera to the place of its choice. However, it shall be subject to the final outcome of the writ petition pending before the high court”.The bench was also informed that Shimla district judge hears appeals against the orders passed by Rera. To ensure those affected by the orders of Rera do not face any inconvenience visiting Shimla for filing appeals, it is directed that appellate power may be shifted to principal district judge of Dharamshala, the bench said.","The bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the people for whom Rera was created were “completely disappointed” “Better abolish this institution, we don’t mind that,” the CJI said.

Nifty50 goes below 25,600; BSE Sensex down over 700 points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-nifty50-bse-sensex-february-13-2026-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets-india-us-trade-deal-donald-trump/articleshow/128285580.cms,"Stock market today (AI image)

Why is stock market down today? Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,600, BSE Sensex was down over 700 points. At 10:45 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,570.30, down 237 points or 0.92%. BSE Sensex was at 82,943.66, down 731 points or 0.87%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence.Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses. The crash wiped out approximately Rs 4.62 lakh crore in investor wealth, reducing the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies to around Rs 467 lakh crore.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams. The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff.

‘Incorrect and speculative’: AAIB rejects Italian report blaming pilot for Air India 171 crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/incorrect-and-speculative-aaib-rejects-italian-report-blaming-pilot-for-air-india-171-crash/articleshow/128264418.cms,"Who Cut the Fuel? Inside the Mystery of the Air India 171 Cockpit Audio

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Thursday clarified that the investigation into the June 2025 crash of Air India Flight AI-171 in Ahmedabad is still ongoing, dismissing reports that the probe has concluded and pinned the blame for the incident on pilot.“The investigation is still in progress. No final conclusions have been reached,” the AAIB said, urging media organisations to exercise restraint and avoid premature speculation, which it said could cause public anxiety and undermine the integrity of the investigation.The AAIB noted that it conducts investigations strictly under the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2025, and India’s obligations under ICAO Annex 13.The preliminary report, released in July 2025, provided only factual information available at the time. The final investigation report, containing conclusions and safety recommendations, will be published upon completion.Earlier, Italian daily Corriere della Sera had reported, citing unnamed sources, that investigators had determined the crash was caused by an “intentional act” rather than a technical defect, and identified Captain Sumeet Sabharwal as the primary suspect.The report claimed US experts assisting in the probe described the findings as a “breakthrough.”The AAIB stressed that such reports are speculative. “Aircraft accident investigations are technical, evidence-based processes aimed at determining root causes and enhancing safety,” it said.The Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, operating Flight AI-171, crashed seconds after taking off from Ahmedabad airport, killing 260 people, including passengers and individuals in a medical students’ hostel where the aircraft fell.Only one passenger survived. The preliminary report indicated that fuel control switches were moved from “run” to “cut-off” during the final moments and highlighted cockpit exchanges between the pilots.The AAIB reaffirmed its commitment to transparency, procedural integrity, and the highest standards of aviation safety.","The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) says the investigation into the June 2025 crash of Air India Flight AI-171 in Ahmedabad is still ongoing.

Congress missing from action

Is ‘solo’ the best way forward?

NEW DELHI: Is the Congress decision to go solo in West Bengal a bold political move with the party’s long-term gains in mind? Or is it a move fraught with political risks in a state where the grand-old party has been literally wiped out from the ground? The Congress, which faces an existential crisis in the state, has broken its alliance with the Left and announced to go solo in all 294 seats in the upcoming assembly elections.Now, consider these facts:In both these elections, the Congress had aligned with the Left to take on the common enemy - the ruling Trinamool Congress and its leader Mamata Banerjee . The Congress’s electoral strategy and political campaign centred around a very strong anti-Mamata theme, led by the then party chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is a known staunch and vocal critic of the Trinamool chief.Interestingly, while the Congress and the Left went all guns blazing against Mamata, the relentless BJP gained ground and captured the opposition space. The story of the 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal was the rise of the BJP as main opposition party and the simultaneous decimation of the Congress and the Left in state politics.So, while the Congress tally in assembly went down from 44 in 2016 to 0 in 2021, the BJP’s score increased from 3 in 2016 to 77 in 2021. In terms of vote share, the pattern was all the more worrying. Congress went down from 12.25% to 3.03% while the BJP jumped from 10.16% to 37.97%.The Congress’s decision to contest solo may signal the party’s resolve to take the long and difficult path of revival, but it perhaps ignores the grim ground reality of the party’s diminishing presence and influence in West Bengal.Does the party have enough time to make its presence felt among the electorate? More so, when its main rivals - the Trinamool Congress and the BJP have already taken giant strides on the ground to woo the voters.Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool have unleashed an all-out offensive against the Election Commission … from the streets of Kolkata to the Supreme Court in the national capital. Mamata has also announced many welfare-driven measures in her interim budget to set the electoral narrative ahead of the high-stakes polls.Some of the key announcements include:The BJP is also in an overdrive as it makes yet another attempt to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress. Top BJP leaders, both in Bengal and in Delhi, have been relentless in their attacks against Mamata Banerjee linking almost every incident in the state to the failure of the Trinamool government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have already addressed many political rallies in the poll-bound state. BJP chief Nitin Nabin has been holding meetings with all stakeholders to energise the party cadres.Here’s a look at some of the key moves which the BJP has already made:In the midst of all these political buzz, the Congress, unfortunately, has been missing from action till now. The Congress leadership seems to have done little on the ground after the past electoral drubbings except effecting a leadership change in the state. Shubhankar Sarkar replaced Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the West Bengal Congress chief in September 2024.Since Adhir was a staunch critic of Mamata Banerjee and was the biggest hurdle in any possible alliance with the Trinamool, the change of guard was construed as a shift in the party’s approach vis-a-vis the Trinamool chief. However, once it was clear that Mamata was not interested in any tie-up, the Congress had no option but to go solo in the assembly polls. Continuing with the Left alliance was not an option given the fact that the Congress has high stakes in Kerala where the CPM-led LDF is its main rival.Shubhankar Sarkar after taking charge had stated that the 2026 assembly elections and strengthening the organisation were two of his immediate missions. However, just months away from the 2026 electoral battle, he seems to be still far away from achieving either of them.Over the years, the Congress has lost its political ground to regional parties across states. Many of the regional parties have grown in the states at the expense of the Congress. Any attempt by the grand-old party to regain its political space is resisted by these state parties leading to friction. This contradiction has been at the core of the alliance trouble which the Congress has had with the regional parties. It is in this context that the party’s decision to go solo in West Bengal should be analyzed. The Congress, which has been voiceless in the state assembly for the last 5 years, has nothing to lose. If the leadership can energise party cadres to make a new beginning on the ground, Bengal could serve as a template for the Congress in other states where it faces similar challenges. One wonders what prevented the Congress leadership from taking this course correction after the 2021 elections drubbing or even after the 2024 Lok Sabha fiasco. Well, better late than never!","In the 2021 assembly elections, the Congress could not win even one seat in the 294-member assembly. The Congress vote share in 2021 assembly election plummeted to 3.03% - the lowest ever in the state. The BJP is also in an overdrive as it makes another attempt to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128253448,imgsize-1661646,width-400,resizemode-4/images-31.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reprimanded Congress MP Jairam Ramesh for challenging an Office Memorandum issued by the Centre to implement the apex court’s judgment on retrospective environmental clearance.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said that since the Office Memorandum was meant to implement an SC judgment, the challenge was effectively against the judgment itself.“Be ready for exemplary costs. We know the design behind this,” a bench led by CJI Surya Kant said.“Can one challenge a judgment by a writ petition? It is just for media consumption,” the bench added.When the bench warned of exemplary costs, Ramesh withdrew his plea.Last year in May, the top court held that the right to live in a pollution-free atmosphere was part of the fundamental right as it struck down the Centre’s Office Memorandum allowing ex post facto or retrospective environmental clearances to projects in violation of norms.“The Union government, as much as individual citizens, has a constitutional obligation to protect the environment,” the court said. It added that it “must come down very heavily” on the Centre’s attempt to do “something which is completely prohibited under the law”.It further observed, “Cleverly, the words ex post facto have not been used, but without using those words, there is a provision to effectively grant ex post facto EC. The 2021 OM has been issued in violation of the decisions of this court….”The Centre, as a result, was restrained from issuing directions for grant of ex post facto clearances in any form or manner or for regularising acts done in contravention of the EIA notification.",Supreme Court reprimanded Congress MP Jairam Ramesh for challenging an Office Memorandum issued by the Centre to implement the apex court’s judgment on retrospective environmental clearance. A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said that the challenge was effectively against the judgment itself.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128240893,imgsize-811163,width-400,resizemode-4/128240893.jpg"

Succumbing to foreign pressure, Modi govt has tampered with the lives of crores of citizens of the country,” he said.Gandhi wondered if PM Modi will listen to farmers and workers now, or if the “grip” on him is too strong, in what was a reference to his LS speech.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has approved the ""Chief Minister Skill Development Scheme"" aimed at providing structured training, financial support and digital market access to artisans engaged in khadi, handloom, cottage industries and the unorganised sector.The decision was cleared at a Cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Rekha Gupta. The scheme seeks to equip traditional workers with upgraded skills and connect them directly to online marketplaces, including the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), according to a statement.Announcing the initiative, Gupta said artisans have long contributed to preserving Delhi's cultural heritage but require modern training and improved access to markets to remain competitive.The scheme, she said, is designed to link skills with sustainable livelihoods and expand opportunities for workers in the evolving economy.The programme will be implemented through the Delhi Khadi and Village Industries Board (DKVIB). During 2025-26, 3,728 beneficiaries will be covered under the first phase, for which Rs 8.95 crore has been approved. A proposed outlay of Rs 57.50 crore for 2026-27 is expected to significantly scale up the initiative, it stated.Under the scheme, beneficiaries will undergo 12 days (96 hours) of structured training, including a two-day Entrepreneurship Development Programme. Training will be conducted in batches of 35 to 45 participants to ensure focused guidance, the statement said.It further mentioned that each trainee will receive a stipend of Rs 4,800 for the training period, along with Rs 100 per day towards meals. Essential toolkits, including foot-operated sewing machines where required, will also be provided after completion of training.A key component of the scheme is digital onboarding. E-catalogues containing artisans' profiles, product details and photographs will be created and uploaded on the ONDC platform to enhance visibility of their products across domestic and international markets, it read.The initiative also includes Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) to formally certify artisans who already possess traditional skills, it stated and added that beneficiaries will receive a certificate and identity card, and will be assisted with Udyam registration, branding support and guidance on accessing credit facilities.In the first phase, the scheme will focus on nearly 18,000 tailors registered on the e-Shram portal. It will subsequently be expanded to include other traditional occupations such as embroiderers, potters, carpenters, cobblers, basket makers, bamboo artisans, carpet weavers and others, as per statement.It stated that applicants must be at least 18 years old. Only one member per family will be eligible, and government employees and their family members will not qualify. Aadhaar-based verification will be mandatory at the time of enrolment.Industries minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said the initiative aims to promote self-reliance among artisan families by combining skill development with market linkage.He added that training in areas such as merchandising, logistics, IT operations and fashion production would help artisans align their crafts with contemporary market demand.The chief minister said the scheme is part of a broader effort to strengthen the khadi, handloom and village industries sector by integrating skills, technology and financial empowerment.","The decision was cleared at a Cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Rekha Gupta.

NEW DELHI: Puducherry chief minister N Rangasamy on Thursday once again called for statehood for the Union territory, ahead of the assembly elections slated for April.Rangasamy was responding to remarks by opposition DMK leaders R Siva and AMH Nazeem, who urged that the demand for statehood should be pursued “without let-up.” Puducherry has remained a Union territory since the former French settlements merged with India in 1962.The chief minister highlighted the “hindrance” that the Union territory status poses to the elected government’s decision-making. The status means that in Puducherry, key powers are exercised by the lieutenant governor, who is a central government appointee, rather than the elected chief minister, limiting the authority of the local administration.“Lack of powers for the elected government under Puducherry’s current Union Territory status has been a major obstacle, preventing the ministry from taking swift decisions and implementing programmes. My party (All India NR Congress) would support the statehood demand if there is a collective consensus among all legislators and political parties,” Rangasamy said in the House, according to PTI.He added that Puducherry had achieved “significant development” over the past five years, despite the challenges arising from the limited powers of the elected government.“As today’s assembly session marks the final sitting of the five-year House, I feel fully satisfied that we were able to meet the aspirations and expectations of the people, thanks to the cooperation of all sections,” Rangasamy stated.Both Siva, the leader of the opposition in the assembly, and Nazeem expressed the DMK’s “full support” for Puducherry’s demand for statehood.“To achieve statehood, we will back any decision, including boycotting the forthcoming Assembly elections, if necessary, as statehood is crucial for the welfare of the people,” they said.Following the chief minister’s response to members’ views on statehood and other matters, Speaker R Selvam adjourned the House sine die.",Puducherry has remained a Union territory since the former French settlements merged with India in 1962.

Rahul Gandhi Targets Modi Over Us Textile Tariffs, Bjp Fires Back

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday backed nationwide protests by workers and farmers demanding protection of their rights.He flagged concerns over labour reforms, trade policies, and potential changes to the rural jobs programme MGNREGA.""Workers fear that the four labour codes will weaken their rights. Farmers are apprehensive that the trade agreement will harm their livelihoods. And weakening or scrapping MGNREGA could snatch away the last lifeline of villages.

It also called for the restoration of the old pension scheme and the implementation of minimum wages for all workers, including scheme workers.Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) working president Binoy Viswam expressed full support for the nationwide farmers’ strike, describing it as a movement to defend people’s basic rights.Apple farmers in Himachal Pradesh have also intensified preparations to join the nationwide farmers’ strike on February 12 and announced a march to Delhi, warning that recent import duty reductions under India-US and other free trade agreements could hurt the state’s apple-based economy.They expressed concern that cheaper imports could impact local growers, despite repeated assurances from union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal that the interests of Indian apple farmers will be safeguarded.While several trade unions and farmer organisations have decided to join the strike, the National Front of Indian Trade Unions (NFITU) said it would not participate, describing the protest as “politically motivated.”","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi backs nationwide protests by workers and farmers.

GCC Unified Visa 2026 launch date: Expected in 2026 (pilot phase)



Pilot phase likely by late 2026, including testing with some country corridors (possibly UAE-Bahrain first).

Full implementation expected to follow once technical, security and biometric systems are linked across all member states.

A valid passport with sufficient remaining validity (typically six months minimum).

Supporting documents like proof of accommodation and return/ onward travel.

Travel insurance covering all GCC states may be required.

GCC Unified Visa fees: Preliminary estimates



Validity of GCC Unified Visa: How long you can stay



30-day stay (single or multi-entry)

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

A unified visa promotes the GCC as a single tourism destination, enhancing its competitiveness with regions like Europe and ASEAN. Simplified logistics: Digital applications and harmonized border systems reduce wait times and bureaucratic friction.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region.

Will banks remain open today?

Which bank unions are participating — and why?

The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti-worker policies. The strike also involves banking unions.Thus, amid the strike, uncertainty looms over banking operations, with customers across cities unsure whether branches will function normally or face disruptions as several bank unions align with the strike call.While banks will remain open, services might face disruptions as major institutions like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda , and UCO Bank have notified the BSE about potential service impacts during the Bharat Bandh.Bank of Baroda has informed customers through its BSE filing that while it is preparing for normal operations, branch services might be affected if the strike takes place. Similarly, SBI noted that although necessary arrangements have been made to ensure normal functioning, work in branches and offices may be impacted to a limited extent.UCO Bank made similar statements in its BSE filing, stating that steps are being taken for smooth operations but branch functioning could be affected if the strike materialises.For customers wondering about bank services on February 12, it is important to note that while banks are not officially closed, planning transactions in advance may help avoid inconvenience due to possible service limitations.Major bank unions including the All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA), and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) joined forces with 10 central trade unions for this protest. They have raised concerns over the new labour codes, alleging that the reforms are unfavourable to workers and could make trade union registration more restrictive.The protest also comes at a time when bank associations have been actively campaigning for improved working conditions, including the long-pending demand for a five-day work week to enhance work-life balance for employees.Over 10 central trade unions called for a nationwide Bharat Bandh to protest the government’s “anti-worker” policies. The strike was supported by farmer organisations and other groups across multiple sectors.The bandh was announced as a demonstration against what the unions described as “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the central government.”Trade unions estimated that nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to take part in the agitation. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) urged farmers to join trade union workers to ensure the success of the all-India general strike.","The nation is observing a Bharat Bandh on Thursday following a nationwide strike call by a joint forum of central trade unions against the Centre’s alleged anti- worker policies.

Indian benchmark indices traded within a narrow range during the week, exhibiting a positive bias amid supportive domestic cues. Market sentiment remained constructive, underpinned by a revival in Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) inflows. After a phase of sustained outflows, FIIs have turned net buyers, reflecting renewed confidence in India’s macroeconomic fundamentals. The continuation of these inflows is expected to lend further support to equities, particularly in light of improving GDP growth expectations.Investor attention has gradually shifted toward the concluding phase of the third-quarter earnings season. Market participants are closely evaluating corporate earnings performance and forward-looking management commentary to gauge the sustainability of earnings growth. Additionally, upcoming inflation data will be a key monitorable in both India and US, as it may influence expectations regarding the Reserve Bank of India’s and US FOMC future rate decision.Developments related to the proposed trade agreement also remain in focus, with reports suggesting that the final contours are nearing completion. Greater clarity on this front could provide incremental direction to the markets in the near term.Overall, the market undertone remains cautiously optimistic, supported by improving macroeconomic indicators and stabilizing external flows.Nifty post the RBI monetary policy outcome rebounded from the support area of 20 days EMA and tested the immediate resistance area of 26,000 in Wednesday session.Going forward, index sustaining above the key psychological level of 26,000, will open upwards toward the key resistance area of 26,200–26,300 in the coming sessions. However, if it fails to move above the 26,000 levels, the index is likely to consolidate in the range of 25,500-26,000.The overall outlook remains positive, and market dips should be seen as buying opportunities.

'Hegemony Unacceptable, Will Resist': Ramapshosa Denounces Trump Trade Onslaught, Tariff Blackmail

The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal. Under the agreement, Taiwanese imports to the US will be getting lower tariffs while the island nation has committed to purchase and invest in American products.The step confirms a framework first presented in January. Under that plan, duties applied by Washington on numerous Taiwanese exports are being reduced from 20% to 15%, alongside efforts to bring in more Taiwanese capital into the US technology industry.Before it can take effect, the pact must pass review in Taiwan’s parliament, which is controlled by the opposition. US trade representative Jamieson Greer said the deal ""will eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers facing US exports to Taiwan.""""This agreement also builds on our longstanding economic and trade relationship with Taiwan and will significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors,"" he added in a statement.Taiwanese vice premier Cheng Li-chiun said that the outcome improves the island’s competitive position, placing it on a ""fair footing to compete with our rivals.""""Compared with our competitor countries, we have even gained a relative advantage, because the gap created by FTAs that previously left us behind has effectively been closed this time,"" Cheng told a press conference in Washington, referring to free trade agreements.He said Taipei had obtained ""Most Favored Nation"" treatment and achieved a reduction in the average charge ""on our exports to the US from an initial 15 percent, without stacking reciprocal tariffs, further down to an average of 12.33 percent.""A fact sheet from the US Trade Representative’s office sets out Taiwan’s intention to drive a ""long-term increase in its purchases of important US goods"" through 2029.Those purchases are expected to cover $44.4 billion in liquefied natural gas and crude oil, $15.2 billion in civil aircraft and engines, and another $25.2 billion spanning power equipment, electricity grids and other items.The document also notes that the United States agreed to ease its tariff levels on Taiwanese products after Taipei committed to taking ""significant steps to advance a stronger and more reciprocal trade relationship.""In addition, Taiwan has undertaken to cut most of its own tariff barriers and open the way for preferential access for American industrial and agricultural exports.","The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal.

Short-duration crops have been defined with a 12-month cycle, while long-duration crops have been pegged at 18 months.To better align loan tenure with crop cycles, especially for longer-duration crops, the tenure of KCC has been extended to six years.The central bank has also proposed aligning drawing limits under the KCC with the scale of finance for each crop season to ensure that farmers receive adequate credit based on the actual cost of cultivation.Further, expenses related to technological interventions such as soil testing, real-time weather forecasts and certification for organic or good agricultural practices have been included as eligible components. These will be covered within the 20 per cent additional component currently allowed towards repairs and maintenance of farm assets.Release of the draft guidelines come after an announcement to this effect made by the RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra at this February's monetary policy statement.","RBI issues draft directions to revise and consolidate guidelines on the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme.

Two Pakistani men, Burhan Mirza and Kashif Iqbal, have been indicted in the US for a $10 million Medicare fraud in which they submitted thousands of fraudulent documents to claim Medicare and other medical insurance money. Burhan Mirza is a resident of Pakistan and he handled the fraud from Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: A critical jaw reconstruction surgery at AIIMS, Delhi has been stalled for over two months due to an administrative deadlock under Ayushman Bharat scheme, leaving a Haryana govt beneficiary in severe pain and unable to eat solid food.Dolly Mandal, a resident of Faridabad, suffered from ameloblastoma of the right mandible, a rare but locally aggressive jaw tumour that destroys bone and can lead to infection and facial deformity if not treated in time.Doctors at AIIMS advised an extended total temporomandibular joint replacement (one unit, right side) to remove the diseased portion of her jaw and reconstruct it. The procedure, estimated to cost Rs 2.5 lakh, including implants, was flagged as medically urgent, with doctors warning that delay could lead to rapid deterioration.""The patient is undergoing treatment in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Pre-authorisation was initiated on Dec 6, 2025, and the case taken up with the state health agency, Haryana, through email and telephonic follow-up. Approval, however, is pending with the state and is subject to clearance by the standing medical committee,"" said Dr V K Bansal, department of surgery, AIIMS.The authority to approve the procedure rests with state govt and is outside the ambit of AIIMS and National Health Authority, Bansal said.Alternative financial assistance may be explored only if the patient holds a BPL ration card, including relief under Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi/Health Minister's Discretionary Grant or the chief minister's fund, he added.During the prolonged wait, Mandal's condition has worsened. Pus began discharging from the tumour, forcing her to survive on a liquid-only diet. The delay has also crippled the family financially, with the patient unable to work and her husband, a daily-wage labourer, staying back in Delhi to care for her and pursue the approvals.The pre-authorisation procedure was filed under an unspecified surgical package, as extended temporomandibular joint replacement is not listed under Health Benefit Package 2022, requiring special clearance from the state health authority. However, the process stalled amid administrative gaps at the state level.The case has drawn sharp legal criticism. ""Why should a patient suffer because of paperwork? Administrative procedures cannot be a reason for delaying treatment. The high court already made it clear that medical care should not be delayed in any circumstance,"" said advocate Ashok Agarwal.Internal correspondence from AIIMS acknowledged the grievance but underscored the hospital's inability to proceed without state approval.Repeated calls and messages to Sumita Misra, Haryana health secretary, for her response on the issue went unanswered.As Mandal waits in pain despite being insured under a govt health scheme, her case exposes a deeper fault line in the system: When treatment hinges on files and committees, who answers for a patient left behind?","Dolly Mandal, a resident of Faridabad, suffered from ameloblastoma of the right mandible, a rare but locally aggressive jaw tumour.

Rivalry between Elon Musk and Anthropic



Anthropic faces 'naming trouble' in India



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now criticised rival AI company Anthropic whose recent AI updates triggered a nearly trillion-dollar selloff in enterprise software stocks and accused its models of being ‘misanthropic and evil’. The comments made by Musk came in response to Anthropic’s announcement on social media platform X (formerly known as twitter) that it has closed $30 billion funding round at the valuation of $380 billion. It is one of the largest private tech raises to date. “We’ve raised $30B in funding at a $380B post-money valuation. This investment will help us deepen our research, continue to innovate in products, and ensure we have the resources to power our infrastructure expansion as we make Claude available everywhere our customers are,” wrote Anthropic.In response to this post, Musk alleged that Anthropic’s AI systems exhibit racial and demographic bias. “Your AI hates Whites & Asians, especially Chinese, heterosexuals and men. This is misanthropic and evil. Fix it. Frankly, I don’t think there is anything you can do to escape the inevitable irony of Anthropic ending up being Misanthropic. You were doomed to this fate when you chose your name. The Name of the Wind,” wrote Musk.Anthropic, led by CEO Dario Amodei, is bets known for its Claude family of large language models. On the other hand, Elon Musk’s AI company xAI competes directly with Calude via its chatbot Grok. The rivalry between the two has intensified in the recent months, particularly after reports that Anthropic cut off xAI’s access to Claude models.Earlier also Musk has mocked Anthropic’s name, “Always worth remembering that fate loves irony. The most ironic outcome for a company named [Anthropic] would be that it is the most misanthropic!”Anthropic is now facing legal trouble in India after a local software company claimed prior use of the name ‘Anthropic’. As reported by TechCrunch, Anthropic Software an Indian software company founded in 2017, filed a complaint in a commercial court in Karnataka in January this year arguing that the US-based AI firm’s expansion into India has caused customer confusion. The company is also seeking recognition of its prior use, relief to prevent further confusion and Rs 10 million ($110,000) in damages.Anthropic Software founder and director Mohammad Ayyaz Mulla told TechCrunch that litigation was not the company’s first choice but became necessary to protect identity. “As of now, I am exercising my legal right as it’s causing huge confusion to my customers,” he said, adding that coexistence would have been preferable if clarity could be achieved.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk has criticised rival AI company Anthropic whose recent AI updates triggered a nearly trillion-dollar selloff in enterprise software stocks.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

As Ramadan approaches, the UAE is once again reshaping the school week. Public school students across the country will study from home every Friday during the holy month, as part of a renewed effort to bring families closer while keeping lessons on track.The UAE’s Ministry of Education announced on Thursday, that distance learning will be implemented on Fridays throughout Ramadan for students enrolled in government schools. This marks the second consecutive year the initiative has been introduced.The programme, titled “Ramadan with Family”, is designed to give pupils additional time at home while ensuring academic continuity. By adjusting the school schedule at the end of each week, the ministry aims to align learning with the social and spiritual rhythms of Ramadan.Under the arrangement, students will study remotely from home every Friday during the fasting month.According to the ministry, the measure forms part of broader Ramadan adjustments to the academic calendar.

However, parents or guardians will be responsible for arranging transportation to and from school on those days.This approach allows families to choose what best suits their circumstances while maintaining operational continuity within schools.To support the initiative, the Ministry of Education will issue a comprehensive guidance handbook. The manual will contain integrated educational and enrichment activities drawn directly from the school curriculum.These activities are intended to:In addition, a detailed guidance manual will outline joint educational and developmental activities derived from the curriculum, ensuring that remote learning remains structured and purposeful.By combining flexible scheduling with curriculum-based enrichment, the ministry aims to maintain academic standards while giving students meaningful opportunities to engage with their families during Ramadan.","The UAE’s Ministry of Education announced on Thursday, that distance learning will be implemented on Fridays throughout Ramadan.

How seagliders could change travel in the UAE



Faster Coastal Commuting: Electric seagliders could dramatically cut travel times compared with traditional boats and road transport along the coast. Earlier studies and planning have suggested a potential Abu Dhabi-Dubai journey in around 25–30 minutes, a dramatic reduction from typical road travel times between the cities.

Since WIG technology operates close to the surface, performance in rough seas or adverse conditions will need careful evaluation. Infrastructure: Harbours, ports, and docking facilities will need upgrades to support widespread seaglider operations.





A groundbreaking new electric seaglider transport system that promises to let people literally glide across the water could soon become a reality in Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE, signalling a major shift in how coastal travel and logistics are handled across the region. The concept, which blends high-speed marine and aircraft technologies with zero emissions, is advancing rapidly through government partnerships and private sector innovation.Electric seagliders are fully electric, Wing-in-Ground-Effect (WIG) craft, designed to travel just above the water’s surface using aerodynamic lift combined with hydrofoil technology. These vehicles are more efficient than traditional boats and far quicker than typical marine transport because they ride on a cushion of air over the water.A prominent model in development is the REGENT Viceroy, an electric WIG vehicle capable of carrying several passengers at speeds potentially reaching 290 kph (180 mph), with long-range capabilities as battery technology advances.According to recent updates, Abu Dhabi leaders and transport authorities have signed a deal with operators to bring electric seagliders to the emirate by 2028. These craft, which combine zero emissions and high speed, are expected to connect coastal communities like Abu Dhabi City and Al Dhafra Region initially, with plans to expand routes across the broader UAE coast.The project reflects a strategic collaboration involving the Department of Culture and Tourism, Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi), the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) and the Integrated Transport Centre (Abu Dhabi Mobility) alongside private operators. Badr Al-Olama, Director General of ADIO, has emphasised that seagliders could position Abu Dhabi at the forefront of next-generation coastal transportation, integrating smart and sustainable mobility into everyday life.The potential applications of this new tech are wide-ranging:Prototype and development efforts are already underway as electric seaglider models have entered sea testing phases with crew onboard and full-scale testing has been reported by developers in the U.S. ahead of expected passenger flights. REGENT, the main company driving this technology and its partners, expect commercial readiness between 2026 and 2028, aligning with Abu Dhabi’s plans for phased rollouts and expanded mobility options along coastal routes.The UAE’s interest in seagliders sits alongside a wider effort to develop electric and autonomous transport solutions across land, air and sea. Initiatives such as electric air taxi ambitions in Abu Dhabi and advanced road automation trials showcase a holistic approach to future mobility. Embedded in policy visions like the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 Strategy, these innovations aim not just to improve travel times but to reduce carbon footprints, encourage clean technology adoption and transform how people and goods move in the 21st century.Despite the promise, several challenges remain:These issues reflect the broader maturation curve for any disruptive transport technology entering public use. As the UAE pushes toward diversified, sustainable transportation models, electric seagliders represent a visionary leap beyond traditional ferries and hydrofoils. They encapsulate cutting-edge engineering, zero-emission ambitions and a shift toward seamless coastal mobility and if plans proceed as expected, we may soon see them gliding above UAE waters within the next few years.Electric seagliders, once futuristic concept vehicles, are now transitioning from prototype to planned deployments in the UAE. With projected commercial operations by 2028 and partnerships spanning government, logistics and energy sectors, this innovative mode of transport could redefine coastal travel, tourism and logistics across the Emirates, showing how sustainable mobility solutions are reshaping the world’s busiest maritime corridors.","Electric seagliders could dramatically cut travel times compared with traditional boats and road transport along the coast.
