It embraces anyone who seeks, keeps dogs as companionAligns itself with the Dashnami sect. Besides being the largest ‘akhara’ in sheer numbers, it is also perhaps the most diverse and is known to have a rich tradition of ‘astra’ (weapons) and ‘shaastra’ (scriptures). It is home to highest number of Naga Sanyasis, Hatha Yogis and Sanyasins. It also embraced newly formed Kinnar Akhara. Many popular spiritual leaders having centres across the world affiliate themselves with it.Daraganj, Prayagraj, UP904 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Kailashanandji MaharajKartikeya SwamiIt is the second largest. Focuses on education besides religion and is known for its educated seersIt is known for having educated seers and is committed to protection of Sanatan Dharma.

Members of this sect see each other as brothers and treat their founder as guruChaak Hanuman, Varanasi, UP646 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Vishwatmanand SaraswatiGaneshaOne of the oldest three. Known for extreme discipline.This ‘akhara’ works to promote ethical and religious virtues among people. They visualise a ‘sanyasi’ as one holding ‘mala’ (rosary) in one hand and ‘bhaala’ (spear) in the other. They have taken on several Muslim invaders as well. They do not believe in caste system or Brahminical order and do not appoint Mahamandaleshwars for thisDaraganj, Prayagraj, UP749 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Vishokananda MaharajSage Kapilmuni (believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu)Pioneered the concept of Mandaleshwar. Upholds ecofriendly livingCommitted to spreading the tenets of Sanatan Dharma, this ‘akhara’ propounded the concept of Mahamandaleshwar or spiritual head. The idea was to form ‘mandali’ (or group) to attract the masses and apprise them about the importance and greatness of religion. Their ‘naga sayasis’ also undertake ‘mimansa’ (religious investigation and interpretation). The head of this ‘mandali’ was called ‘mandalishwar’ which eventually came to be known as ‘mandaleshwar’. Head of several ‘mandaleshwars’ was called ‘mahamandaleshwar’. The akhara was the first to appoint a woman ‘mahamandaleshwar’.Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Maharashtra1856 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Balkanand GiriSuryaFosters freedom, promotes discipline and nationalist causeUnlike other ‘akharas’, this one doesn’t follow a protocol. A ‘sanyasi’ on the lowest level of ladder can speak his mind freely. It also doesn’t follow certain fixed practices like Nagar Pravesh. It also picks learned persons committed to Vedic education and promotion of Indian culture from society and academia to appoint them as Mahamandaleshwar.Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi, UP547 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Arun Giri MaharajSuryaPioneers of Naga Sanyasis, first ones to establish their camp in KumbhAawahan Akhara is touted to be the pioneer of Naga Sanyasis. Mahant Gopal Giri said that once Sanyasis entered a war. At that time, Adi Shankaracharya called upon sanyasis of the Atal and Maha Nirvani Akharas to conduct ‘pind-daan’ (a kind of funeral ritual) and stand up for the cause of religion. After the ritual, the sanyasis disrobed themselves (as if they shunned the last layer of consciousness towards the material world). Thereafter they smeared their body with ashes from a funeral pyre, picked a spear and plunged into the battle and won.Girinagar, Bhavanath, Junagadh (Gujarat)1192 ADAcharya Mahamandaleshwar Shri Mat Ram KrishnanandGayatri MataAkhara without Naga Sanyasis, takes up social causes like free education, forestation, and serving cowsThis ‘akhara’ comprises Naishtika Brahmachari or someone who vows to remain celibate and live with their guru until death. Adi Shankaracharya appointed four types of dedicated celibates named Ananda, Chaitanya, Swaroopa, and Prakashaka in the four monasteries he established. Their duties included the study and contemplation of scriptures like the Vedas, Puranas, and Upanishads, as well as performing rituals such as worship and sacrifices. Over time, the main purpose of this tradition became the primary aim of Agni Akhada. Their key objectives include promoting religion, protecting and advancing culture, serving schools, cow shelters, and serve wandering saintsShamlaji Kakchowk Temple, Sambhar Kantha (Gujarat)1784 ADPosition vacantLord HanumanTheir nagas wear only whiteThe ‘akhara’ is known for having maximum number of 850 ‘Khalsas’ (equivalent to Mahamandaleshwars). The naga sadhus of this akhara wear only white but remain prepared to fight for the religion both through ‘shastra’ and ‘shaastra’. They believe in service and run ‘langars’ and ‘bhandaras’ during Kumbh and Magh MelasAyodhya, UPShri Mahant Murli DasLord HanumanFosters wrestling, fighting without weapons. Had contributed to development of constitutionThe seers of this ‘akhara’ stand out because of their unique ‘tilak’’. But besides serving its deity and his devotees, this ‘akhara’ fosters a culture of wrestling and raises professionals. Many of these seers have participated in national-level wrestling competitions and won medals. Shri Mahant Gyan Das Maharaj, who became the president of the Akhara Parishad in 2004, was also a champion in Uttar Pradesh and held several titles. The ‘akhara’ also has a tradition of Ni-Yudha or fighting without weaponsDheer Sameer Mandir Bansivat, Vrindavan, Mathura, UP1720 ADShri Mahant Rajendra Das MaharajLord RamAssociation with Ram Temple movementA key player in the Ram Temple movement and legal battle, the Nirmohi Akhara follows the Ramanandi sect of Vaishnava Sampradaya . The ‘akhara’ was founded by Acharya Ramanandacharya. People, including women, of all castes can be a part of this ‘akhara’ and can achieve important positions. Women can rise to become ‘Mahamandaleshwars’ but are not involved in administrative work. Over six lakh seers are associated with this sect across India.1825 ADKrishnanagar, Prayagraj, UPShri Mukhiya Mahant Durgadas (and three other Mukhiyas who head the four directions)Guru ChandradevDoesn’t believe in caste segregation; contributed to freedom movementThis ‘akhara’ follows the core principles of devotion, knowledge, and renunciation and remains committed to study of the Vedas, Vedangas, and Ashtanga Yoga. They run more than 100 ‘ashrams’ across India. One of the ‘ashrams’ of this sect, based in Sultanpur, actively participated in the Indian freedom movement. It is claimed that in Kumbh held in 1920s and 30s, they trained revolutionaries as well.Kankhal, Haridwar, Uttarakhand1846 ADMahant Jagtar MuniGuru ChandracharyaCommitted to serving humanityCommitted to promotion of Sanatan Dharma by serving society, they remain committed to establishing Sanskrit schools, hospitals, temples, and inns for public welfare. Besides major pilgrimage sites, during the Ardh Kumbh or Purna Kumbh festivals, the ‘akhara’ provides free food and accommodation to pilgrims while promoting religious teachings. In times of natural disasters and national crises, the ‘akhara’ actively contributes to maintaining the country’s unity and integrity.

The ‘akhara’ has close ties with Sikhism, especially Khalsa Sikhs. It is also home to Nihang Sikhs. It is said that Guru Gobind Singh sent a batch of five saffron robe seers (Panch Nirmal Gaurik) to Varanasi to learn the Vedas, Vedang and Dharma Shastra.

Management of Akharas:

A vibrant kaleidoscope ofwill come alive during Prayagraj Maha Kumbh . This pristine celebration of life & faith will also lay out a Sangam of ‘akharas’. Though this Sanskrit word means a wrestling arena, in its deeper layers, it carries many microcosms.takes a peep into the fascinating world.It was the curse of Durwasa that paved the way for Samudra Manthan and Kumbh traditions. “Once eminent but short-tempered Maharishi Durwasa cursed the Gods and deprived them of their powers. Demons capitalised the opportunity to establish their reign over heaven. Aggrieved gods urged Lord Vishnu to help who said that lost fortunes were lying in deep layers of the ocean and advised for Samudra Manthan to regain them,” says Prof Madan Mohan Pathak, faculty in astrology at Central Sanskrit University, Lucknow citing references from Bhagwat and Vishnu Puranas . “Amrit Kumbh (vessel containing elixir of immortality) was among the 14 gems that surfaced. Desirous gods and demons entered into a tug-of-war over it. Vishnu -- disguised as the enchantress Mohini -- intervened and whisked the Kumbh away. As he took it heavenwards, few drops of Amrit fell in rivers of Haridwar, Ujjain, Nashik and Prayag. Over time, belief that those who bathe in these rivers in a cosmic moment will embrace purity, auspiciousness, and immortality gave birth to Kumbh rituals,” adds Pathak.In Sanskrit, ‘akhara’ means a wrestling arena, but on a closer look – they are an entire microcosm existing inside the protected walls of Mathas that become visible during Maha Kumbh. “Akharas speak for a kind of social order within the ecosystem of a ‘matha’ or ‘ashram’ (an educational premises for seers) that shouldered the responsibility of protecting the traditions of Sanatan Dharma,” explains Rana PB Singh, retired professor in cultural geography at Banaras Hindu University (BHU). Vedic scholar and author Mahant Mithlesh Nandini Sharan of Ayodhya notes that ‘it is tough to trace the exact origin of ‘akharas’ and calls them ‘a living proof of Sanatan tradition’. “Tradition of ‘akharas’ is as old as religion itself. When seers established ‘mathas’, they often faced challenges from demons who disrupted their religious practices and rituals. Therefore, many seers raised a martial wing for protection of Sanatan Dharma. Naturally, those guarding the seers had to be physically fit, and the place where they practised their skill was described as akhara ,” Mahant Mithlesh says adding, “Without Akharas, Kumbh would just be a religious fair.”Virtuous seer Adi Shankaracharya – who anchored consolidation of Sanatan traditions in the 8century when it had been divided into various warring sects – is described as the father of the present form of Kumbh rituals.In ‘A History of Dasnami Naga Sanyasi’, author Jadunath Sarkar notes ten seer groups present in the 8century – namely Giri, Puri, Bharti, Ban, Aranya, Parbat, Sagar, Tirtha, Ashram, and Saraswati – were aligned to four ‘Mathas’ established by Adi ShankaracharyaWhile ‘Puri’, ‘Bharti’ and ‘Saraswati’ branches were attached to Sringeri Matha (South), ‘Ban’ and 'Aranya' orders were lined up with Govardhan Matha in Jagannath Puri (East). The ‘Giri’, ‘Parbat’ and ‘Sagar’ were sent to Joshi Matha (North) while ‘Tirtha’ and ‘Ashram’ branches were assigned to Sarada Math at Dwarka (West). He also marked the jurisdiction and character of each ‘matha’ and connected them in a ritualistic protocol, way of life and even titles.In present times, the seven Shaivite Akharas namely Mahanirvana, Atal, Niranjani, Anand, Juna, Avahan, and Agni belong to the Dasnami order.The 14century saw the birth and rise of Ramanandacharya. Born in Kanyakubja Brahmin family of Varanasi, Ramanda walked the Vaishnava path. An early and key proponent of the Bhakti movement, he is also seen as a social reformer who accepted disciples without discriminating on lines of gender, class or caste. Doyens like Kabir, Ravidas, Bhagat Pipa and so on are dubbed as his disciples who are known to be belonging to the Ramanandi order. Three main akharas of the Kumbh align themselves with Ramanandacharya. In his paper titled, ‘Akhara System in Kumbh Mela: An Epitome of Hindu Mythology’, published in the International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research, HS Bhakuni, a faculty member in the department of history at MB Govt PG College Uttarakhand notes that the Vaishnava sect is grouped into Digambara, Nirmohi and Nirvani. The unique identity of these ‘akharas’ is visible in their flags, rituals and way of dressing. Their naga sanyasis wear white.The remaining three akharas – grouped as Udasin – are linked to Sikhism. The word udasin means neutral or unbiased. Scholars noted that the followers of the udasin order keep Guru or teacher as the supreme being on the thought that one cannot achieve God without the guidance of guru. They also picked ‘service’ as the means of salvation while ditching the elaborate and complex rituals. They came up in the 18century and members associated with them remain committed to service. Within the akharas, they follow religious rituals only to get close to their Guru who would eventually help them sail through.On Mauni Amavasya Snan of independent India’s first Kumbh, held in 1954, an unprecedented crowd of pilgrims reached the Sangam. The religious euphoria lost its bounds, failed the crowd control measures and led to a stampede claiming around 800 lives and leaving over 2,000 people injured. An official probe into the incident led to the formation of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP). Since then, it has been playing an important role in organising Kumbh Melas. Presently, ABAP includes representatives of all 13 akharas and serves as the apex body of monastic orders. It takes important decisions on Kumbh Mela, and addresses matters related to monastic orders. It also solves disputes (if any) between them.Within the larger structure of Juna Akhara, a Maai Baara was created at the turn of the century. Many women ascetics who completed their 12 years penance were ordained in 2013 Kumbh. At that time, women ascetics urged their leaders to replace ‘baara’ with ‘akhara’ as the former meant an enclosure. Thus, Sanyasin Akhara was born.Kinnar Akhara – the sect of transgender community – also came up in the Ujjain Kumbh of 2016. In Kumbh Mela of 2019, some 2,000 transgender monastics and seers participated under the banner of Kinnar Akhara.Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, said that she founded the ‘akhara’ to unite transgenders, sort out their issues, eliminate misconceptions, inform people about their rights besides spreading a message among masses about the position the transgenders hold in Sanatan Dharma. In 2019, they were accepted as part of Juna Akhara.Jadunath Sarkar noted that the four great ‘mathas’ of Dasnami orders have adopted certain rules of affiliation and organisation. Akharas don’t take sanyasis directly. They must first enrol in a ‘Marhi’ (initiation centre). Many marhis combine to form an akhara.Within each order, monks are graded according to their spiritual progress into –Kutichak, Bahudak, Hansa and Paramhansa.A Kutichali ascetic renounces the world to live in a forest. He cannot travel or beg and must survive on unasked donations. Bahudah is the wandering mendicant who cannot stay in a place for more than three days. He collects alms in kind and cannot accept cash.Renunciant Bhakuni must have followed the above for at least 12 years of practice.There is no minimum age to become a sanyasi.With penance relating to control over speech, thoughts and action, sanyasis earn titles like Hansa and Paramhansa and the right to hold the Dand (seen as an embodiment of God) who also have rules and regulations. For instance, an ekdandi seer cannot bow only before their mother and no one else including God.All ‘akharas’ have their own Naga Sadhus and Hatha Yogis as well.A small act of indiscipline may lead to compulsory fast or chanting while a moderate may mean withdrawal of ration supplies. Grievous ones may invite expulsion for a limited time and extreme ones may mean expulsion for life.Versions of the Sannyas Upnishad are used to manage the akharas through spiritual leaders and an administrative unit.The spiritual chief is called ‘Mahamandaleshwar’ who can have a council consisting of ‘Mandaleshwar’ and ‘Mahant’.When Akharas grew in strength, the need for many mahamandaleshwars was felt which paved the way for the overarching Acharya Mahamandaleshwar.The administrative body managing the ‘akhara’ is called ‘panch’ (also linked to Adi Shankaracharya’s Panchyatan Padhyati in which five gods – namely Ganesh, Vishnu, Shiva, Durga and Surya are invoked).The panch comprises five persons running the show with ‘Sabhapati’ as president and mahants as members. Ranks below ‘Mahant’ include ‘Karbaris’, ‘Thanapati’, ‘Sachvis’, ‘Pujaris’, ‘Kotwals’ and ‘Kotharis’ who are elected in Kumbh Mela.","In Sanskrit, ‘akhara’ means a wrestling arena, but on a closer look – they are an entire microcosm existing inside the protected walls of Mathas. ‘Akharas speak for a kind of social order within the ecosystem of a ‘matha’ or ‘ashram’ (an educational premises for seers) that shouldered the responsibility of protecting the traditions of Sanatan Dharma.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117160967,imgsize-2124747,width-400,resizemode-4/117160967.jpg"
"For help to crash-hit, Good Samaritans to get 5x more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-help-to-crash-hit-good-samaritans-to-get-5x-more/articleshow/117159926.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Government will increase the reward amount for Good Samaritans who rush road accident victims to hospitals for immediate medical care to Rs 25,000, five times more than the present reward of Rs 5,000, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday.In a televised conversation with actor Anupam Kher on road safety, Gadkari said he has instructed his road transport ministry to increase the reward amount considering that the current reward is too little for a person who rushes road accident victim/s to a hospital or trauma care centre within the first hour (or golden hour), often crucial in saving someone's life.Though government introduced the provision of reward to encourage people to help road accident victims from Oct 2021, road transport ministry's website defines a Good Samaritan as ""a person who, in good faith, without expectation of payment or reward and without any duty of care or special relationship, voluntarily comes forward to administer immediate assistance or emergency care to a person injured in an accident, or crash, or emergency medical condition, or emergency situation.""The present scheme specifies the procedure for giving reward and a certificate of recognition to ensure that genuine persons get them. There are different levels of verification and endorsements for anyone to get the reward. Moreover, the policy specifies that those who come to the help of victims in a fatal crash are eligible to get these incentives.No data is available in the public domain of how many Good Samaritans have helped save lives and been awarded so far.","Government will increase the reward amount for Good Samaritans who rush road accident victims to hospitals for immediate medical care to Rs 25,000.

Metro Derailment in Chennai: Detailed Report Ordered; Ultrasonic Tests Planned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/detailed-report-ordered-after-metro-derailment/articleshow/117096282.cms,"Chennai: Two weeks after a train derailment in the Washermenpet-Tondiarpet stretch , the commissioner of metro railway safety has sought a detailed report from Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL). Additionally, an ultrasonic pulse velocity test is planned across the entire underground network to detect damp or weak spots and prevent future accidents.Preliminary findings suggest that a water pipeline running above the underground metro line may have burst, creating a damp spot on the top of the tunnel and weakening the diaphragm wall, a reinforced concrete barrier to prevent water from seeping in.On Dec 23, concrete on the spot gave in, allowing water mixed with sand to gush into the tunnel. Slush accumulated on the tracks, and the train driver noticed something amiss only after the wheels hit the slush. The driver applied emergency brakes, causing a minor derailment. While no injuries were reported, services on phase I extension line were disrupted for a few hours.An internal team later sealed the breach with grouting and chemicals. This marks the second such incident on the line in two months.Deputy commissioner of railway safety Nitish Kumar Ranjan, based in Bengaluru, said the incident was reported to their office on Jan 6. ""We have sought a report from CMRL and may inspect the site, if necessary, based on their response,"" he said.A CMRL official said that while minimal water seepage could occur, it was rare for sand and water to mix and flow onto tracks, especially in the absence of heavy rainfall. ""Changes in the water table around the tunnel could cause minor water drips, but not a steady flow of slush,"" the official added.To prevent such incidents, CMRL plans to engage an external agency to conduct a comprehensive pulse velocity test, said T Archunan, director (projects), CMRL. This will help identify damp or weak spots that are difficult to detect during routine inspections.","On Dec 23, concrete on the spot gave in, allowing water mixed with sand to gush into the tunnel. Slush accumulated on the tracks, and the train driver noticed something amiss only after the wheels hit the slush.

NEW DELHI: Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is unlikely to travel straight to Pakistan after participating in Republic Day celebrations, official sources said Saturday following hectic diplomatic efforts by India to convince Jakarta to not club his India visit with his proposed official travel to Islamabad.India had last year invited Subianto as chief guest for the Republic Day parade but a formal announcement about his visit is still awaited. Amid this delay by India in announcing the name of the chief guest for the Jan 26 celebrations, reports emerged in Pakistan media this week that Subianto will arrive in Islamabad the same day for a three-day visit.TOI first reported Friday that Indian government had raised the issue diplomatically with Jakarta as it found the President's reported plan to fly straight to Islamabad after being honoured by India unacceptable. While R-Day is a special occasion, Indian govt has urged foreign leaders for years now to not mix their travel plans to India with Pakistan even for bilateral visits, maintaining it goes against the grain of dehyphenation that India seeks from them in their ties with the two countries.Official sources said the Indonesian President won't travel to Pakistan from India. Reports emerged Saturday that he might fly to Malaysia from India late on Jan 26 but there was no official confirmation. There has been no official word from Jakarta yet on Subianto's itinerary.It's not clear if the President, in case he does indeed travel to Malaysia, will fly in the opposite direction again to visit Islamabad or shelve his Pakistan visit plans for now. Pakistan's ministers were quoted as saying last week that the ""landmark"" visit would allow Indonesia and Pakistan to take steps to ramp up their economic ties.The proposal for Subianto's visit to Pakistan seems to have emerged from his meeting with Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif on the sidelines of a multilateral event last month.","Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is unlikely to travel straight to Pakistan after participating in Republic Day celebrations, official sources said.

NEW DELHI: In an era of 'digital arrests' and credit card fraud, a gang in Bihar conceived an unusual method of scamming young men. The plan? pay young men to impregnate ""helpless"" women. The catch? It was all a scam. Instead of a payout, victims found themselves trapped in a web of lies, with nothing to show for their ""fertile"" efforts but a lighter wallet.The suspects, identified as Prince Raj, Bhola Kumar, and Rahul Kumar, are believed to be part of a larger criminal gang. Police recovered six mobile phones from their possession.According to Nawada DSP (Headquarters) Imran Parwej, the arrest followed a complaint filed with the Cyber police station. The suspects had been luring young men with the promise of hefty payments for impregnating women, running the scam from Kauara village under the jurisdiction of Nadriganj police station. The suspects allegedly operated through social media advertisements, offering between Rs 5 to 10 lakh for making childless women pregnant. Even if the attempts were unsuccessful, they guaranteed Rs 50,000 to the individuals.The fraudsters' operation was linked to an ' All India Pregnant Job Service ' website, which they used to target potential victims.

CAG: Recommendations of expert panel ignored

NEW DELHI: A CAG report, evaluating performance of Delhi government's regulation and supply of liquor in the national capital between 2017-18 and 2020-21, has observed several irregularities in excise policy and its implementation, similar to the findings of probe carried out by CBI and ED. CAG has thus estimated a loss of Rs 2,027 crore to the exchequer.The report was signed by former CAG GC Murmu in March 2024 and sent to LG and Delhi government. But, it has not been tabled by state government. Sources have confirmed the report's authenticity. CAG pointed out many violations, from award of licenses to wholesalers to appointing retailers and lack of monitoring and distribution of liquors.The report talks about pricing of liquor left at the discretion of manufacturer and wholesalers instead of government. ""This discretion allowed L1 licensee (manufacturer and wholesaler) to manipulate prices of liquor to its own advantage,"" the CAG has said. This led to decline in sales and loss to exchequer. There was no quality control monitoring either in the liquor sold in Delhi.Instead of end-to-end tracking for liquor sale through bar code scanning, the excise department went for post-sale stock reconciliation, undermining inventory tracking and data accuracy. ED and CBI had alleged payoffs of Rs 1,000 crore.The auditor has blamed AAP government and party's top functionaries in ignoring the Cabinet in formulating the new excise policy. ""In violation of Cabinet decision, necessary permissions from the Cabinet/opinion of Lieutenant Governor were not obtained before giving important exemptions/relaxations having revenue implications (in new excise policy for 2021-22),"" CAG has said.CAG further pointed out that the ""recommendations of the expert committee, formed for suggesting changes for formation of new excise policy, were ignored. These changes included grant of wholesale license to private entities instead of state owned wholesale entity, upfront charging of excise duty in the license fees in place of excise duty to be charged per bottle, applicant being allowed to get a maximum of 54 retail vends in place of an individual being allotted a maximum of two vends.""It dramatically surfaced in political circles on Saturday, leading BJP to launch a ferocious attack on AAP. Approached by TOI, sources in the government confirmed its authenticity.The report talks about the pricing of liquor left at the discretion of the manufacturer and wholesalers instead of the government, something which was the focus of CBI's investigation. “This discretion allowed L1 licencee (manufacturer and wholesaler) to manipulate prices of liquor to its own advantage,” CAG has said.

While ED and CBI in their probe had alleged payoffs of Rs 1,000 crore, CAG in its findings, after evaluation of excise department documents, has claimed the irregularities resulted in a total loss of Rs 2,027 crore.“There was revenue loss of Rs 890 crore to the government as it did not re-tender the surrendered retail licences,” the report has said, in addition to the loss of Rs 941 crore due to exemptions given to zonal licencees.The federal auditor has said that the AAP government overruled the excise department to give waiver of licence fees of Rs 144 crore to zonal licencees on the basis of Covid restrictions (28 Dec 2021 to 27 Jan 2022). A further Rs 27 crore loss was on account of incorrect collection of security deposit from zonal licencees, it said. “These implementation issues of the new policy led to a loss of revenue of approximately Rs 2,002 crore,” the auditor said.The auditor has blamed the AAP government and its top functionaries in ignoring the cabinet in formulating the new excise policy. “In violation of the cabinet decision, necessary permissions from the cabinet/opinion of the lieutenant governor were not obtained before giving important exemptions/relaxations having revenue implications (in the new excise policy for 2021-22),” the auditor has said.The CAG further pointed out that the “recommendations of the expert committee, formed for suggesting changes for formation of new excise policy, were ignored.","The report was signed by former CAG GC Murmu in March 2024.

IMPHAL: An airy classroom bathed in soft daylight, filtered through large windows. The wooden desks and red plastic chairs, neatly arranged in rows, await the lively whispers of curiosity. The image captures the heart of learning, hope and coexistence at Needy Home Academy , undisturbed by the outside world's tumult.Located in Mapao Zingtun village, about 25km north of Imphal, the academy is home to 632 students and 42 teachers from various ethnic backgrounds. The sprawling 30-acre campus — with a four-storey building daubed in mauve at its centrepiece — is an oasis where Meiteis and Kukis, who are otherwise locked in conflict, play, sing, and live together.This residential school is a living embodiment of unity and harmony in Manipur, where the deepening ethnic crisis between Meiteis and Kukis has claimed more than 250 lives and displaced nearly 60,000 people since May 2023.Students and teachers from different communities coexist peacefully. ""Though the number of students drastically dropped after the violence erupted, those who choose to remain live in harmony without any untoward feelings against each other,"" said school principal Themshang Sasa.Chemistry teacher Maikado Moirangthem recalled the initial fear of conflict spilling into the school. ""When the violence broke out, I thought of leaving the school, fearing that we might even fight among ourselves. But our uncle Dr Chance Raman convinced us to stay. Here we are today, living as a big family,"" he said.Founded in 2004 by Tangkhul Naga couple Raman and R Angam, the school aimed to provide modern education infused with moral principles to rural children.

(The writer is chairman of the Ayodhya Ram temple construction committee)

The Shri Ram Temple is more than a physical structure, it is a beacon of India's cultural and spiritual heritage . Every element of its construction reflects the dedication, precision, vision and expectation of millions of devotees in the country and abroad. From the careful selection of materials to the integration of advanced engineering techniques, every decision has been guided by the temple's structural stability: to serve as a place of devotion and inspiration for generations to come.The temple's design incorporates features that enhance its cultural and spiritual significance. Intricate carvings on sandstone pillars and walls, traditional motifs, and alignment with celestial principles add profound meaning to its architecture. Construction of Shri Ram Temple in Ayodhya is not just an architectural feat, it is a confluence of faith, history, and modern engineering .This iconic structure, nearing completion by March 2025, symbolises India's spiritual heritage, brought to life by innovative engineering practices and timeless traditions, ensuring its endurance for 1,000 years.The temple's foundation incorporates advanced techniques while respecting the principles of traditional Indian temple construction. At the heart of it lies a 1.5m-thick plain cement concrete (PCC) raft, supported by a roller compacted concrete (RCC) base extending 12-15m deep. This design ensures that temple's weight is evenly distributed, safeguarding stability.Experts from IIT Madras, alongside other leading professionals, meticulously designed the PCC mix to achieve an unprecedented 1,000-year design life. The use of M35-grade concrete, tested for 56-day strength, ensures durability, structural integrity, and resistance to environmental factors.The construction of the massive PCC raft presented unique challenges. The pouring process required careful planning to prevent thermal stress, which could cause cracks. Advance thermal simulations were conducted to predict heat generation during curing - a critical phase when the chemical reaction between cement and water releases heat.Despite these precautions, minor surface cracks of 1mm appeared during the early stages of curing. Experts from IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, CBRI Roorkee, Larsen &Toubro and Tata Consulting Engineers, with guidance from Prof V S Raju and the temple trust construction committee, identified thermal strain as the primary cause. The initial large pour size (27m x 9m x 1.5m) and the heat of hydration were contributing factors.The pour size was reduced to 9m x 9m x 1.5m to limit thermal stress. Optimised curing techniques, including controlled hydration rates and temperature monitoring via embedded sensors, were introduced. Additionally, the PCC raft surface was treated with a special chemical compound to enhance durability and address minor surface irregularities. These interventions resolved the cracking issue and reinforced the engineering rigour behind the project.One of the most distinctive features of the temple is the conscious exclusion of steel and iron from its construction. While steel is commonly used in modern construction, its susceptibility to corrosion posed a challenge for a structure designed for such longevity.Instead, traditional stone interlocking techniques inspired by ancient Indian temple architecture were employed. Massive sandstone blocks were precision-cut and interlocked without metal fasteners. This method, used in heritage structures like the Konark Sun Temple and Brihadeeswara Temple, has stood the test of time. While the foundation and structure draw heavily from traditional methods, the construction process leverages state-of-the-art technology. Advanced tools like 3D modelling and finite element analysis ensured precision and quality. Automated monitoring systems provided real-time data.The construction of the Ayodhya Ram Temple offers valuable lessons for future projects aiming to preserve heritage while embracing technological advancements, sustainability, and engineering innovation. It reminds us of India's ability to blend its rich heritage with cutting-edge technology, creating landmarks that inspire awe and reverence.This temple is not just a place of worship, it is a legacy-a structure that will narrate the story of India's spiritual and engineering achievements for generations to come. It is a tribute to the vision, dedication, and skill of everyone involved in its construction, from architects and engineers to artisans and labourers. When the first rays of sun illuminate temple's intricately carved walls, they will shine upon a structure that embodies the soul of India - a confluence of devotion, tradition, and progress.","Construction of Shri Ram Temple in Ayodhya is not just an architectural feat, it is a confluence of faith, history, and modern engineering. This iconic structure symbolises India's spiritual heritage, brought to life by innovative engineering practices and timeless traditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117159081,imgsize-847918,width-400,resizemode-4/117159081.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India is now working to finalise a $450 million deal for the export of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to Indonesia, which would make it the second Asean country after the Philippines to buy the precision strike missile with a 290-km range. The proposed deal has been in the works for a long time, with Indonesian defence minister discussing the deal with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh during a visit to New Delhi in July 2020. ""There are some budgetary constraints, but discussions have moved forward towards conclusion of the BrahMos deal now,"" a source said.India has stepped-up discussions on export of BrahMos to other Asean countries after inking a $375 million contract to supply anti-ship coastal missile batteries to Philippines in Jan 2022, with an eye on China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific. Apart from the Brahmos missiles , which have been developed jointly with Russia, India also plans to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25-km, to countries like Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.","India is working to finalise a $450 million deal for the export of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to Indonesia.

Mumbai: Every fourth urban Indian has elevated levels of cholesterol, every second one has insufficient vitamin D levels, and 8% are anaemic. This unhealthy snapshot of urban Indians emerged from a study analysing test results of 1.5 lakh people who underwent wellness checkups in various metro cities in 2024.These results underline the fact that non-communicable diseases (NCD), which are chronic, have emerged as a public health challenge in India. Previous research studies established that one in every four Indians is at risk of dying from an NCD—be it cancer, stroke, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases. Around 60% of deaths in the country can be attributed to NCDs, according to World Health Organisation.The new findings, which are a part of the Agilus Diagnostics' 2024 Wellness Study, also show that 27% of those studied had high readings of HbA1C — a blood test that measures amount of glucose attached to haemoglobin in red blood cells. Due to high sugar intake and increased consumption of processed food, Indians are at greater risk of NCDs if they also have low physical activity level.According to Dr Deepak Sanghavi from Agilus Diagnostics, ""The wellness study's findings are a stark reminder of how urban lifestyles are impacting health. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can weaken immunity and cognitive function, while thyroid and lipid abnormalities often go unnoticed until they lead to more severe complications like metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular issues.""Senior endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi from Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, concurred, stating that it's now established that one in three Indians has diabetes and an equal number have dyslipidemia or elevated levels of cholesterol.The medical thought on vitamin D has, however, changed, he said. ""It's now not advisable for all to take vitamin D supplements every year. Only those with a vitamin D of less than 10 nanograms per milliliter need to take it,"" said Dr Joshi. Diet improvement should be adequate for those with a vitamin D count above 20, while corrective action is needed for those with a count between 10 and 20 if they have some symptoms of poor bone health or low immunity.""Vitamin D levels among Indians are hit by a 3-tier effect: There is too much smog to allow sun rays to reach the ground, cities are concrete jungles that don't allow sunshine indoors, Indians have higher levels of melanin which absorbs UV rays needed to synthesise vitamin D,"" he said.The way to beat NCDs, he said, is to maintain an appropriate diet, exercise, and sleep of seven hours a day.","Every second urban Indian has insufficient vitamin D levels, and 8% are anaemic.

Poll Will Genome Sequencing Data Impact Healthcare in India? No, It Will Take Time to Make a Difference Yes, It Offers Great Potential

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals and said it will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research .The Genome India Data , which represents the genetic diversity in the country, will be available to researchers at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) through managed access. ""I am confident this will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research,"" Modi said in a video-recorded statement played out at the Genomics Data Conclave organised by the Department of Biotechnology.Modi said this national database will facilitate advancements in the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases, foster the development of new medications and precision medical techniques, and enable research into the lifestyles and habits of diverse communities.A genome is the complete set of DNA sequences in an organism and contains all the instructions required for that organism to function, including embryogenesis, growth, responding to the environment, and healing from disease. The primary aim of Genome India is to construct a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations for India's population that will better capture our unique diversity. Launched in January 2020, its goal is to sequence 10,000 genomes from healthy Indian individuals spanning the length and breadth of the country.The Human Genome - the complete map of all 23 large DNA sequences (chromosomes) that encodes our species - comprises a total of around three billion base pairs contained within the nuclei of each of our cells.According to Martin Carkett and Alexander Honkala, experts in the field, while this sequence of base pairs is virtually identical in every human, differentiating us from, say, a chimpanzee or a mouse, there are nonetheless subtle differences in each of our individual genomes that make us unique. Whole-genome sequencing enables us to read a person's individual genome and, among other things, identify differences from the average human genome that are often associated with disorders and disease but can also be associated with other factors like disease resistance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals.

NEW DELHI: While the Indian government has invited Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to participate in the Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest, and an official announcement about his visit is expected any moment now, it would not like him to club his visit to India with a proposed visit by the president to Pakistan.Official sources have maintained for the past several weeks that Subianto will be the chief guest for the January 26 parade, but no official announcement has been made so far about the visit. Normally, the same announcement is made months in advance.Amid this delay in announcement, reports emerged in Pakistan media earlier this week that the president is likely to arrive in Islamabad on January 26 for a 3-day visit. India has encouraged foreign leaders in the recent past to not include Pakistan in their itinerary while travelling to India, and to dehyphenate their ties with the 2 countries.It is learnt that India has raised the issue diplomatically with Indonesia, hoping to dissuade Subianto from flying directly to Islamabad after the R-Day celebrations. The president hopping on a direct flight to Islamabad hours after the Indian military parade will be bad optics for India, given its troubled relationship with Pakistan over a range of issues, not least cross-border terrorism. Subianto had met the Pakistan PM, Shehbaz Sharif, in Egypt on the margins of a multilateral event in December and pledged to enhance economic cooperation between the two countries.With their common focus on political sovereignty, economic self- sufficiency and independent foreign policy, India and Indonesia have traditionally enjoyed strong ties. Indonesia has also emerged as India’s largest trading partner in the Asean region. During the state visit of then Indonesian President Joko Widodo in 2016, the two countries agreed to establish a Security Dialogue in order to develop a comprehensive action plan on security cooperation.Widodo was in India again in 2018 as one of the chief guests for the Republic Day parade, along with the leaders of 9 other Asean member-states.

Nijjar murder case



NEW DELHI: Canada has refuted media reports which stated that the four Indian nationals accused of murdering Sikh Canadian Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 had been released from custody after the case against them fell apart.""It is not true that the four accused have been released on bail,"" Ann Seymour of the BC Prosecution Service told CBC News. ""All four accused were detained, and they continue to remain in custody.""The next court appearance is a pretrial conference on February 11, and they will also appear in court on February 12.The statement comes after several media reports stated that the four individuals charged with the murder of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar have been released from custody.The reports cited documents filed by Canada's department of justice.The accused — Karan Brar, Karan Singh, Amandeep Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karanpreet Singh — were charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with Nijjar’s killing on June 18, 2023.Court documents show the status of the accused as “not in custody,” marked with an ""N."" The news of their release came days after former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation.The incident took place in the parking lot of a Gurdwara in British Columbia's Surrey, where Nijjar, who led the Khalistan Tiger Force , was fatally shot in what has been described as a ""contract killing.""A video of the incident, which reportedly surfaced in March 2024, showed armed men attacking Nijjar as he exited the Gurdwara.Nijjar’s killing has been at the center of strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada. Trudeau had alleged a possible involvement of Indian government agents in the murder, a claim India has consistently denied, calling it “absurd” and “motivated.”India has accused Canada of harbouring extremist and anti-India elements, including supporters of the Khalistan movement.Earlier, the ministry of external affairs stated that Canada had not provided any specific evidence or formal communication regarding the case, despite the arrests of Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder.The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) in British Columbia, which is handling the case, has accused the individuals of murder and conspiracy.

'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5.

No, Wildfires Are a Natural Occurrence Yes, Climate Change Is a Major Factor



Why the fire was so catastrophic

One of the biggest factors is that you have prolonged dry spells and low humidity. And then you have the Santa Ana winds coming from the desert—very, very high winds, as much as 100 miles per hour. Once you get a spark, those things just blow. Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster to the Columbia Climate School

Jennifer Garner’s Tearful Story: A Friend Lost In The LA Wildfires – The Shocking Reality

The catastrophic wildfire currently sweeping through Los Angeles has already left at least 11 people dead, destroyed thousands of homes, and decimated large areas of land. What began as a relatively contained fire quickly spiraled into a full-scale disaster due to a dangerous combination of high winds, dry conditions, and insufficient resources.The fire first broke out on January 7 in the Altadena area, quickly escalating as gusts of winds reached speeds over 80 mph. The ferocious Santa Ana winds carried the flames from the mountains into densely populated urban areas like Malibu and Pacific Palisades.By January 8, the fire spread so quickly that it overwhelmed local firefighting efforts, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. Despite efforts to control the flames, critical infrastructure like fire hydrants were found to be ineffective in several areas, with reports by NBC News, indicating that some hydrants had run dry, leaving firefighters without essential resources when the fires reached the city’s urban core.Several factors contributed to the catastrophic scale of this wildfire. One of the primary reasons for the fire's rapid spread was the intense, gusting winds, which carried the flames through narrow canyons, fanning them and creating a firestorm that was nearly impossible to control.According to fire experts, the Santa Ana winds are notoriously unpredictable and dangerous, often making wildfires more difficult to manage, NBC reported. While these winds have been a regular feature in the region’s fire seasons, their intensity in January 2025 was exacerbated by extreme weather patterns driven by climate change, making the situation even more perilous.Additionally, the region had been in a prolonged dry spell following a brief period of rain in 2023, which left the vegetation parched and ideal for fueling wildfires.The dry conditions created a perfect storm for the fire to spread rapidly across both urban and rural areas the Columbia Climate Review said. As Jon Keeley, a research ecologist, noted, the drought-like conditions left behind large amounts of dry vegetation that acted as fuel for the blaze. Without significant rainfall to replenish the vegetation, the fire's progression was unstoppable once the winds took hold.Urban sprawl, particularly in areas at the wildland-urban interface (WUI), also played a significant role in the severity of the disaster. Many of the affected areas, including affluent neighbourhoods, have experienced rapid growth in recent years.As noted by the Columbia Climate Review, areas like Malibu, which were once remote and sparsely populated, have seen significant development, increasing the vulnerability of these communities to wildfires. This urbanisation, combined with inadequate fire-resilient infrastructure, left many homes exposed to the flames with limited escape routes and firefighting resources.As fire departments struggled to keep up with the overwhelming scale of the fire, reports indicated that many affected residents were not provided with sufficient evacuation instructions. In some cases, confusion over emergency alerts led to false evacuations, further delaying response efforts, the NBC report said.Local authorities, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have vowed to conduct a full investigation into the utility failures, including the lack of water at critical moments during the fire.","The fire first broke out on January 7 in the Altadena area, quickly escalating as gusts of winds reached speeds over 80 mph.

Elon Musk’s criticism for Jeff Bezos ex-wife



MacKenzie Scott’s strategy: A shift toward repeat donations



MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has become one of the most prolific philanthropists in recent history. Over the past five years, Scott has donated an astounding $16 billion (approximately Rs 1,36,000 crore) to various charitable causes, placing her at the forefront of global philanthropy, as per reports. Through her Yield Giving initiative, Scott’s approach focuses on trust-based philanthropy, offering unrestricted grants to non-profits. While her efforts have drawn widespread praise, they have also sparked debates. Tech billionaire Elon Musk recently expressed his unease about Scott's donations, particularly regarding the issues they target and their potential long-term impact.MacKenzie Scott has reshaped philanthropy through her unconventional and expansive approach. Her Yield Giving initiative emphasizes trust-based grants, which provide non-profits the flexibility to allocate funds according to their needs. This model of unrestricted funding is a significant departure from traditional philanthropy, which often comes with stringent conditions.In 2024 alone, Scott introduced an open-call application process, inviting non-profits to apply for funding. Over 6,000 organizations submitted applications, and Scott ultimately awarded $640 million to more than 360 non-profits, exceeding her initial commitments. This innovative approach has been described as transformative, allowing organizations to address critical needs and achieve long-term goals.Despite Scott’s groundbreaking generosity, her donations have drawn criticism from certain quarters, including Elon Musk. Musk shared a social media post by entrepreneur John LeFevre that scrutinized Scott’s donations. The post argued that her contributions primarily benefit the ""NGO/non-profit complex"" and questioned whether they address the world's most pressing problems.Musk agreed with the post, expressing concern over Scott’s focus on causes such as racial equity, immigrant rights, and LGBTQ justice. He suggested that these efforts may inadvertently promote divisive ideologies rather than fostering unity or tackling urgent global issues.In 2024, Scott adopted a new strategy by making repeat donations to organizations she had previously supported. For example, CAMFED, an organization focused on girls’ education in Africa, received three additional grants, while Enterprise Community Partners, initially awarded $50 million in 2020, received an additional $65 million.This shift in strategy reflects Scott’s commitment to building long-term partnerships with non-profits and ensuring sustained impact. Her approach has been hailed as a game-changer by recipients, enabling organizations to plan effectively and achieve greater outcomes.","MacKenzie Scott is the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Was it a smart move by the Los Angeles Lakers to skip Kyle Kuzma close to the February trade deadline?



""Los Angeles will be in the market for Chicago’s Lonzo Ball. Chicago is seeking multiple second-round picks.""

Thehave officially ended their pursuit of former forward, a one-time NBA champion and key member of their 2020 title-winning team. This decision, made by Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka , comes as the team focuses on improving and strengthening its roster with new talent before the February 7 trade deadline. Kuzma, currently signed to a $90 million, four-year deal with the Washington Wizards, had been linked to a potential return to Los Angeles for weeks besides $21.4 million Lonzo Ball.NBA insider Brett Siegel broke the news, stating,This deal, which also included Shake Milton from the Brooklyn Nets , is seen as a move to address immediate team needs without revisiting past lineups.Kyle Kuzma, who spent four seasons with the Lakers before being traded to the Wizards in the deal for Russell Westbrook, was instrumental in the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 championship. Playing alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis, he contributed significantly to their 17th franchise title. Despite these successes, his return now seems unlikely, with Los Angeles pivoting in a different direction.Currently playing for the Washington Wizards , Kyle Kuzma's season has been marked by challenges. The Wizards sit at the bottom of the league with a dismal 6-30 record, and Kuzma has struggled with availability, appearing in only 19 of their 36 games. He is averaging 14.6 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game, shooting 44.2% from the field and just 25.9% from beyond the arc.The decision to pass on Kuzma shows the Los Angeles Lakers ' broader strategy as they aim to retool around their core players. Rob Pelinka recently completed a significant trade centered around D'Angelo Russell to bring in Finney-Smith and Milton, reinforcing the team’s depth and defensive capabilities. These moves indicate a shift toward more logical acquisitions over nostalgia-driven reunions.The Los Angeles Lakers are also rumored to be exploring other trade opportunities.

WASHINGTON: The medical license of an Indian American physician has been permanently revoked for illegally recruiting and harbouring two Indian women to be household servants for low pay. Dr Harsha Sahni , who maintained a rheumatology practice in Colonia, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to conceal and harbour aliens and filing a false tax return last February.She is scheduled to begin serving a 27-month prison sentence handed down by a federal court judge in October 2024, attorney general Matthew J Platkin and the division of consumer affairs announced on Wednesday.Sahni had been temporarily suspended from the practice of medicine since September 2023, as the State pursued an administrative action to revoke her license in the wake of her criminal plea.""The revocation announced today brings closure to a disturbing case in which a physician sworn to uphold the highest standards of care and compassion exploited and abused vulnerable victims for her own financial gain,"" attorney general Platkin said.""There is no place in the medical profession for this kind of criminal conduct and utter disregard for humanity.""""Dr Sahni's treatment of the women she illegally harboured as cheap labour for her and her family violated the most basic rules of the medical profession and caused her victims unimaginable suffering,"" said Cari Fais, director of the division of consumer affairs.""Only the permanent revocation of her medical license could adequately protect New Jersey and its residents from the dangers she posed as a practising physician,"" Fais said.Sahni had pleaded guilty to the charges last February.

Sam Altman’s sister accuses him of sexual abuse; family responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-family-responds/articleshow/117038723.cms,"Poll How Can Society Better Prevent Sexual Abuse? Stronger Legal Actions and Support More Education and Awareness

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statement

Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. We know many families facing similar struggles understand this well.

Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life.

Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this.

Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.

All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.

We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for.

Take a look at her post



“Choices, Hard Work and Happiness

I debated whether to write this post, because the risk of being misquoted on this issue in this clickbait world is high. But I am trying to share what is a nuanced point of view on the issue of work-life balance.

1. Hard work is important and I was taught and believe that it is the only way to rise. In the competitive workplace, I also believe the person who works harder will rise faster. Great careers, achievements, and companies are the results of a lot of hard work.

2. Hard work is a choice. Ambition is a choice. And choices have consequences. Not everybody has to aspire to be a CEO or founder with a mega exit. I know many people who have chosen the path of a less demanding career within their field because time off from work matters to them. No judgments.

3. Now let's talk hours. I worked 100 hours a week for four consecutive months on my 1st project during my 1st job.18 hours a day, with one day off (and not Sunday—I got Monday off because I had to be at a client site on Sunday).

What was it like? 90% of the time, I was miserable. I went to office bathrooms and cried, ate chocolate cake from room service at 2 a.m., and was hospitalized twice. Most importantly, I may have been at work for 100 hours, but I was not productive in those. The same story is true for many of my graduating classmates who joined similar roles in banking, consulting, etc.

Hard work is not equal to hours worked. Many of those hours in entry-level careers were pure facetime. Heck, I know a friend who created a screensaver with an Excel model to convince their boss they were in the office! No wonder many of us didn't last in those roles very long. Hard work needs to be sustainable for us to be able to do it for a long period of time, which is when compounding kicks in.

4. Hours is not equal to

productivity

. Many developed nations work 8–4 but ensure those hours are productive. Come in on time, bring your best to work, have only necessary meetings, and use technology to be effective. Recently, I was telling my investment team, “Let’s find a way to use AI to make research more efficient—our talent cannot spend hours on grunt work.”

5. Family and mental health cannot be absent from this. Otherwise, we will build a world of anxiety and breakdowns, early heart attacks, unhappy marriages, and absentee parenting. I could work those hours I did as a young, single girl because I had no responsibilities. Today, between my career, managing my home, caring for parents, and giving time to my husband and son, I am consumed. And this is despite privilege: a hands-on husband, support staff, parents who chip in, and lots of resources. I commute 1.5 hours a day, but many commute 3–4 hours in our cities. They have homes to run, chores to do, dabbas to pack, kids to drop to school and more.

6. As organizations, we have to think about the culture we create. Of course, founders/CEOs work harder—they have economic incentives to do so. But I have found in our own org that when you create a culture where people find purpose in what they do, they will go above and beyond for you, even in difficult personal circumstances. Forcing anything is hard, let alone enforcing a certain number of hours. Inspiring people to give their best is easier.

7. All of us have to contribute to making India a developed nation. But as we do so, we should also strive to be a happy nation—enjoying the fruits of that development: the joy of building, of giving our families better lives, and of experiencing what the previous generation may not have had. Happiness, inclusive growth, and development go hand in hand.

Finally, I meet many young people, especially women, who are questioning whether they should have a family because of the fear that family and career cannot coexist. This debate scares them even more. Having a happy relationship with work and life is possible while contributing to the dream of Viksit Bharat. Let’s tell our kids that.”

Radhika Gupta , MD & CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund , has shared her views on work-life balance . Gupta has shared a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to join the ongoing debate sparked by L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan's controversial remarks on work-life balance. Earlier, Subrahmanyan suggested employees work 90-hour weeks and his comments on ""staring at your wife"" drew criticism from figures like Deepika Padukone while billionaire Anand Mahindra emphasised prioritising quality of work. In her X post, Gupta acknowledged the complexities of the debate and highlighted the importance of hard work for achieving success but also emphasised that it's a personal choice tied to individual ambitions.In her elaborate X post, Gupta wrote:",Radhika Gupta has shared her views on work-life balance on social media.

More nutritional deficiency-linked deaths reported in women than men across Maharashtra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/more-nutritional-deficiency-linked-deaths-reported-in-women-than-men-across-maharashtra/articleshow/117164672.cms,"The issue is exacerbated by societal norms that prioritize boys' nutrition, especially in economically disadvantaged families, affecting young girls the most.

PUNE: Data from the state's health department has highlighted that women are more likely to be susceptible to malnourishment and nutritional deficiencies compared to men.This is causing a relatively higher number of linked deaths and severe health conditions in the female demographic.Numbers reveal that more women are undernourished; govt hospital doctors also testified to a higher prevalence of these conditions.Experts and activists have pointed to a possible reason being the patriarchal mindset in some families, wherein boys are groomed to be physically stronger as 'traditional breadwinners'. Activists in the field pointed out that in many households, women deprive themselves of fresh food and eat leftovers or stale food to ensure less wastage.The findings came to light in data analysed from the health department's State Bureau of Health Intelligence Vital Statistics (SBHIVS) for 2023. Last year, Maharashtra reported 142 deaths directly linked to nutritional deficiencies (86 were reported among women).The three major categories of nutritional deficiency-related deaths are those due to malnutrition, protein-energy malnutrition, and other nutritional deficiencies. Of these, 49 deaths were due to malnutrition, of which 32 were reported among women. Among the 43 deaths due to protein-energy malnutrition, 30 were women. Of the 50 deaths due to other nutritional deficiencies, 24 were reported among women. Further, the unreported numbers could be much higher, experts said.State officials clarified that these deaths are a direct result of malnutrition.The data also shows that nutrition deficiency deaths are reported mostly among young girls. All 32 malnutrition deaths and 30 protein-energy malnutrition deaths were seen among women aged below 14 years.State family welfare department additional health director Dr SP Wadikar - who is also in charge of Centre's Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) that looks after programmes pertaining to adolescents - said, ""It is true that malnutrition or nutritional deficiency-related cases are most commonly reported in girls compared to boys. These cases usually come from lower economic groups, where a family tends to prioritise high-energy food and reserve it for only one child - often the male child. Irregular periods also add to nutritional loss.""Dr Aarti Kinikar, head of the paediatrics department at Sassoon Genera Hospital, said, ""Young girls in their pre-teen or teen years come to our hospital with a host of problems that can be directly attributed to malnutrition. This is not just an economic problem but a social one, too. Those from lower income groups that mainly depend on physical labour work to earn daily wages want stronger boys and tend to prioritise a male member's health.""","Numbers reveal that more women are undernourished; govt hospital doctors also testified to a higher prevalence of these conditions. Last year, Maharashtra reported 142 deaths directly linked to nutritional deficiencies (86 were reported among women). All 32 malnutrition deaths and 30 protein-energy malnutrition deaths were seen among women aged below 14 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117164752,imgsize-74932,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/117164752.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
