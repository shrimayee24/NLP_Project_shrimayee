NEW DELHI: Air India’s Thiruvananthapuram (TRV)-Delhi flight AI 2455 on Sunday night with several MPs among the passengers safely diverted to Chennai following a suspected snag — weather radar malfunction. The aircraft, an Airbus A320neo (VT-TNL), hovered arbiter Chennai for some time to burn off fuel and avoid an overweight landing. On its approach to Chennai, the plane was given a go-around by the air traffic control (ATC) — meaning asked to abort landing and then touch down in second attempt — due to debris on the runway, which the pilots executed safely. On landing, say sources, no fault was detected in the weather radar during checks but still as a precautionary measure a key component — trans receiver — was replaced.In a detailed statement, the DGCA said: “On Aug 10, 2025, Air India A320 aircraft VT-TNL was scheduled to operate flight AI2455 (TRV-Delhi) with scheduled time of departure as 7.15 pm. Due to late arrival of aircraft from Delhi, aircraft departed TRV at 8.04 pm. During flight, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulent conditions. Crew observed that weather information depicted on the weather radar was not accurate.Suspecting weather radar malfunction, they diverted to Chennai.”“To avoid overweight landing and burn extra fuel, the aircraft with air traffic control (ATC) clearance orbited 25 nautical miles northeast of Chennai for 43 minutes (from 9.25 pm to 10.08 pm). After the aircraft was cleared for approach runway 25 at Chennai, (crew was) at 10.19 pm was instructed to carry out a missed approach by ATC as departing Gulf Air flight GFA 53(Chennai-Bahrain) reported debris on left side of runway. ” Apron control carried out inspection of the runway and nothing was observed. The AI aircraft was given landing clearance and aircraft landed safely at 10.39 pm. “During engineering inspection no deficiency was observed. However, as a precautionary measure, weather radar transreceiver was replaced with a serviceable one,” the DGCA said.A combination of multiple factors including slight delayed departure from TRV, bad weather, announcement of the flight diverting due to a snag, hovering over Chennai and then a go-around added to the anxiety of passengers.Congress MP K C Venugopal who represents Alappuzha in Lok Sabha was among the parliamentarians on board. He said on X early Monday morning: “AI 2455 from Trivandrum to Delhi, carrying myself, several MPs, and hundreds of passengers, came frighteningly close to tragedy. What began as a delayed departure turned into a harrowing journey. Shortly after take-off, we were hit by unprecedented turbulence. About an hour later, the captain announced a flight signal fault and diverted to Chennai. ”“For nearly two hours, we circled the airport awaiting clearance to land, until a heart-stopping moment during our first attempt — another aircraft was reportedly on the same runway. In that split second, the captain’s quick decision to pull up saved every life on board. The flight landed safely on the second attempt. We were saved by skill and luck. Passenger safety cannot depend on luck. I urge DGCA and aviation ministry to investigate this incident urgently, fix accountability, and ensure such lapses never happen again,” Venugopal added.Aircraft routinely go around for safety reasons due to a number of factors like unstabilised approach or a plane/vehicle being on the runway it is supposed to land on. Air India denied that AI 2455 was asked to go around because there was another aircraft on the runway.An AI spokesperson said: “The flight crew of AI2455 operating from Thiruvananthapuram to Delhi on August 10 made a precautionary diversion to Chennai due to a suspected technical issue and given the weather conditions enroute. The flight landed safely in Chennai, where the aircraft will undergo the necessary checks. We regret the inconvenience caused to affected passengers…. At AI, safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority. ”Congress MP for Virudhunagar Manickam Tagore B who as also on board said on X: “Shocked & shaken. Air India AI 2455 from TRV to Delhi, carrying MPs & hundreds of passengers, narrowly escaped disaster today — turbulence, flight signal fault, and a near runway collision in Chennai…. Passenger safety cannot rely on luck. We demand answers & action now.”Replying to him, AI said: “…diversion to Chennai was precautionary, due to a suspected technical issue and poor weather conditions. A go-around was instructed by Chennai ATC during the first attempted landing, not because of the presence of another aircraft on the runway. Our pilots are well-trained to handle such situations, and in this case, they followed standard procedures throughout the flight…”Air India arranged another Airbus A320neo, VT-TQE, which flew the passengers from Chennai to Delhi as AI 2455. The usual flying time of AI 2455 (TRV-Delhi) is 3.5 hours with a schedule departure time 7.15 pm. According to flight tracking sites, it took off with a slight delay on Sunday at 8 pm & landed in Chennai at 10.39 pm. The alternate aircraft took off from Chennai at 1.40 am & landed in Delhi at about 4 am.Seasoned aviators say while AI 2455 had a routine suspected snag, passenger anxiety levels have expectedly been higher post the deadly June 12 AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad and subsequent incidents.",Air India flight AI 2455 from Trivandrum to Delhi diverted to Chennai on Sunday night due to suspected weather radar malfunction.

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram on Sunday lashed out at the Election Commission of India (ECI), asserting that it is “not a court” and must not act like one while dealing with petitions or complaints.In a post on X, Chidambaram wrote, “The ECI is not a court and cannot behave like a court in entertaining petitions or complaints. It is an administrative body tasked with ensuring free and fair elections.”Clarifying the scope of Rule 20(3)(b), he said it applies only when an Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) accepts or rejects a specific claim to be included in the electoral rolls -- not in cases of alleged large-scale manipulation of an entire assembly constituency’s rolls.Citing a newspaper report, he alleged that complaints from Booth Level Agents in Bihar are being ignored. “If true, this refusal to entertain complaints during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) will spell the death of democratic elections,” he warned, adding that the ECI’s duty extends beyond mere procedure to safeguarding the rights of political parties and voters.Meanwhile, the Election Commission has reiterated its stand that Rahul Gandhi must either submit supporting documents for his recent ""vote theft"" allegations or apologise.The reminder follows a notice from the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) and a follow-up from the Haryana CEO.In an August 10 letter, the Karnataka CEO said Rahul Gandhi had, during his August 7 press conference, cited ECI records to allege that a voter named Shakun Rani voted twice, based on data shown by a polling officer.However, the voter has denied the charge, and officials said the tick-marked document displayed by Rahul Gandhi was not issued by the polling officer, raising doubts about its authenticity.The Karnataka CEO has asked Rahul Gandhi to share the original documents forming the basis of his claim so a detailed investigation can be carried out.",Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram on Sunday lashed out at the Election Commission of India.

No need for Supreme Court to comment on abilities of high court judges: CJI BR Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-need-for-supreme-court-to-comment-on-abilities-of-high-court-judges-cji-br-gavai/articleshow/123225356.cms,"SC has no authority to dictate rosters of HCs: Justice Kant



NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, who is next in line to succeed him, have disapproved of the tendency of judges of superior courts to comment on the knowledge and ability of lower court judges, and said the Supreme Court and high courts are only to correct, modify impugned orders/judgments, or set them aside, if they were perverse.""The high courts are not subordinate to the SC as both are constitutional courts. SC can only rectify, modify or set aside the orders/judgments of HCs. The Constitution gives no authority to comment on the ability, capability or knowledge of individual judges of HCs,"" the CJI told TOI.Justice Kant agreed. ""Superior court judges must discharge their role as friend, philosopher and guide for lower court judges. In the three-tiered justice delivery system, persuasion and guidance yields better results than criticism and castigation,"" Justice Kant, who'll take over from Gavai on Nov 24, told TOI.Remarks of the CJI as well as Justice Kant assume significance in the wake of an SC bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan criticising an Allahabad HC judge for passing ""the worst and most erroneous order"" and barring him from hearing criminal cases. The bench Friday expunged its directions for de-rostering the judge while requesting the HC chief justice to look into the matter.Endorsing the vision encapsulated in the saying 'a judge who has not committed a mistake is yet to be born', CJI B R Gavai told TOI that the same principle applies to HC judges, who should refrain from castigating judicial officers on the ground of lack of ability, knowledge or capability while hearing appeals against impugned orders authored by them.""They must administratively convey how to improve and in which area. For that, HC CJs concerned have a significant role to play. The role of superior courts in imparting required training to lower court judges in various aspects of adjudication, acquiring knowledge in myriad fields of law and maintaining proper demeanour and decorum in the courtroom will shape the future of the justice delivery system and reinforce people's faith in judiciary,"" the CJI said.Justice Kant said HC judges and judicial officers come from various social strata and bring with them a wealth of real-life experiences which can be harnessed, modulated and sharpened with legal training to enrich the justice delivery system to meet day-to-day challenges of open court hearing and address grievances of litigants.""On the judicial side, SC has no authority to dictate to HCs which of their judges would hear what types of cases or the manner in which cases are to be decided. It can only lead by example and guide them with its judgments. Allocation of cases to judges and their roster squarely falls in the exclusive domain of the HC CJ concerned,"" Justice Kant said.CJI Gavai said, ""Every constitutional court judge, be it in HCs or in SC, has the constitutional responsibility to do justice in each case, whether criminal or civil or any other field of law. Superior court judges have the onerous duty to maintain civility while passing orders or writing judgments.""","Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant disapprove of the tendency of judges of superior courts to comment on the knowledge and ability of lower court judges.

‘Bharat Is Bharat’: Mohan Bhagwat’s Powerful Call To Protect India's Name, Soul, And Identity

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday expressed concerns over the increasing commercialisation of healthcare and education while speaking at an event in Indore. He said that both sectors, once considered acts of service, have now become unaffordable and inaccessible for the common man.“Health and education are extremely important and were earlier considered as ‘seva’ (service), but now both are beyond the reach of common people. Both have been commercialised. They are neither affordable nor accessible,” Bhagwat said at an event in Indore.Citing personal experience, Bhagwat recalled, “when I was a child, I had malaria and missed school for three days. My teacher came home, and brought jungle herbs for my treatment. He was concerned that the student who came to him should stay healthy. Society needs accessible and affordable healthcare.”Referring specifically to cancer care, he said, good cancer care is currently available in only 8-10 Indian cities, and stressed the need for healthcare that does not become a source of anxiety for patients.“We need low-cost, easily accessible medical care. Treatment should not turn into a cause of worry,” he added.Bhagwat also said that Western medical research cannot be uniformly applied across the world due to regional and individual differences.“Someone may benefit from naturopathy, others from homeopathy, no single way can be supreme. Indian medical systems treat based on personal needs,” he noted.On the education front, he pointed out that students still have to travel long distances for quality education, just as patients do for advanced healthcare.","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat expressed concerns over the increasing commercialisation of healthcare and education.

Also, Sourav Ganguly weighed in on the speculation around Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma’s ODI futures, stressing that team selection should be based on performance.Defence minister Rajnath Singh slammed the recent tariff hikes on Indian goods by the US President, suggesting that certain global powers are trying to obstruct India’s economic rise out of envy over its rapid development. He emphasised that despite such external pressures, India’s ascent as a global power remains unstoppable, pointing to the country’s growing defence exports as proof of its resilience and strength.Following Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on Operation Sindoor, BJP leaders hit back sharply, accusing the Congress MP of echoing a Pakistani narrative and attempting to undermine the armed forces. Both Kiren Rijiju and Amit Malviya cited statements by IAF chief AP Singh, highlighting the government’s strong political will and the operational freedom given to the armed forces during the mission.Himachal Pradesh continues to battle intense monsoon rains, which have claimed 219 lives and caused infrastructure losses estimated at Rs 1,988 crore since June 20.

NEW DELHI: Can organs, say a kidney or the liver, retrieved from a deceased donor with a history of diabetes or hypertension be used for transplantation?In a first of its kind factual assessment and report, the Indian Society for Organ Transplantation (ISOT) has said the benefits far outweigh the risks involved and, therefore, such donations should be considered subject to the viability of the organ.According to the ISOT, while Indian data are lacking, international registries report hypertension in 15-20% and diabetes in 2-8% deceased donors. ""Evidence from the US Renal Data System (USRDS) and the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) databases suggests minimally increased risk of primary non-function, acute rejection, or delayed graft function (DGF) and marginally lower graft survival from such donors, particularly in kidney transplantation,"" the ISOT statement published in the Lancet Regional - South-east Asia says. It has been co-authored by doctors from 32 top medical institutions in the country, including AIIMS Delhi, Safdarjung hospital, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital Mumbai, Max Saket and Madras Medical College Chennai among others.Over time, diabetes that isn't well controlled can damage blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure. High blood pressure can cause more kidney damage by raising the pressure in the filtering system of the kidneys, according to the Mayo Clinic.Dr Dinesh Khullar, a leading nephrologist and co-author of the ISOT statement, said they have suggested a screening criterion to decide whether kidneys donated from a diabetic deceased donor can be considered or not. ""Outright rejection is wrong. In my view, doctors should carry out individualised risk assessment of the donor organ and recipient profile to reach a conclusion,"" he said.Dr Shiv Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences said organs from deceased donors with a history of diabetes, hypertension or cancer can be used on a case-to-case basis. ""A liver biopsy should be done to see the extent of fibrosis and fat in liver from a diabetic donor, as one-third may be unfit. Similar caution for hypertensive donors for kidney donation needed. Organ from a donor cured of cancer for over two years, should be acceptable. """,Indian Society for Organ Transplantation says benefits far outweigh risks. International registries report hypertension in 15-20% and diabetes in 2-8% deceased donors. Doctors suggest screening criterion to decide whether kidneys donated from diabetic deceased donor can be considered or not.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123224936,imgsize-881057,width-400,resizemode-4/123224936.jpg"

Such attempts should be appropriately dealt with by SC, and heavy costs should be imposed for the petitioner's attempts to deliberately mislead SC.""EC said exclusion of a name from the draft voter list did not mean it was deleted from the electoral roll.""The draft roll simply shows that the duly filled enumeration form of existing electors has been received during the enumeration phase. But, on account of human involvement in execution of this exercise of scale, there is always a possibility that an exclusion or inclusion might surface due to inadvertence or error,"" it said.Informing SC that the draft electoral roll had been shared with political parties as statutorily mandated so as to ensure all attempts are made to reach out to individuals and no eligible voter is left out, EC said, ""As neither the law nor guidelines provide for preparation or sharing of any such list of previous electors whose enumeration form is not received for any reason during the enumeration phase, no such list can be sought by the petition as a matter of right. ""On Aug 7, booth level officers again held polling station-level meetings with booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by political parties and others, and read out and shared the list of electors whose name could not be included on the draft electoral roll, and appeals were made to BLAs and others to reach out to them so that no eligible voter was left out, it said.EC said the provision for non-supply of reason for deletion of names from the voter list was in sync with the statutory provision, which mandates that no inquiry is to be conducted for inclusion of a persons' name in the draft electoral roll on acceptance of his/her enumeration form. Those persons whose names were not included on the voter list can apply for inclusion till Sept 1, it said.EC said prior to publication of the draft electoral roll, it had directed chief electoral officer, district electoral officers, electoral registration officers and booth level officers to share with political parties the booth level list of individuals whose enumeration forms were not received, and suggested that they seek assistance from political parties to reach out to those who had not submitted requisite forms.""The final roll, which will be published after the present SIR exercise is completed, and claims and objections are decided, will contain all such information based on the disposal of claims and objections. Thus, the allegation of the petitioner that there is deviation from the past practice in this regard, is false, misconceived, erroneous, unfounded and misleading,"" EC said.","EC said there was no provision in the Representation of the People Act or relevant rules mandating sharing details of preparation, publication or names of people deleted from the draft electoral roll with anyone, including petitioners before SC, except political parties. EC said exclusion of a name from draft voter list did not mean it was deleted from electoral roll.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123224033,imgsize-61306,width-400,resizemode-4/123224033.jpg"

The satellite will provide direct-to-smartphone broadband connectivity, eliminating the need for specialised terminals.The next-generation American satellite is expected to reach India in Sept and will be launched aboard LVM-3-M5, Isro's heaviest rocket, from the Sriharikota spaceport. BlueBird satellite uses AST & Science's patented technologies for connecting to cellphones in a space environment for their SpaceMobile constellation.The satellite has a communications array measuring 64.38 sq m to establish direct connectivity with cellphones via 3GPP-standard frequencies, in partnership with leading cellular service providers around the world. After NISAR, the Block-2 BlueBird launch will further boost Indo-US space collaboration.Narayanan, who was presented with an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Maharashtra governor C.P. Radhakrishnan during the convocation ceremony at SRM Institute of Science and Technology at Kattankulathur near Chennai, talked about the rapid strides India’s made in the field of space technology.He said Isro was set up in 1963, with a tiny rocket being donated by the US that year to mark the beginning of the Indian space programme. In 1975, with satellite data given by the US, Isro demonstrated ‘mass communication’ through 2,400 TV sets at 2,400 villages across six Indian states. “From that (humble beginnings), the 30th of July was a historic day for the Indian space programme. We have launched the NISAR satellite, the costliest one ever built in the world.

'Torture' of Bengalis set to become Durga Puja theme across Kolkata,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/torture-of-bengalis-set-to-become-durga-puja-theme-across-kolkata/articleshow/123223564.cms,"KOLKATA: ""Atrocities"" against Bengalis in several states is set to be one of the major Durga Puja themes across Kolkata this year. Highlighting how alleged persecution of Bengali-speaking Indians and attempts to brand them ""Bangladeshis"" undermine the community's contributions to Indian society, several puja committees have decided to go big on themes underlining the heritage of Bengal, plight of migrant workers, and cultural and historical contributions of prominent Bengalis.From big players to new entrants, puja committees will focus on the ""harassment"" of migrant workers for speaking Bengali. While Behala's Adarshapally Club has set its theme on the plight of Bengali refugees during Partition, Baguiati Ashwininagar Bandhumahal will trace Bengal's history back to human existence in the delta 42,000 years ago.In its 81st year, Chaltabagan Sarbojonin's theme is 'Ami Banglay Bolchhi (I am speaking in Bangla)'. The pandal, interestingly, stands adjacent to the house of poet, playwright and lyricist Dwijendralal Roy. ""Our pandal will focus on the oppression of Bengalis,"" said organiser Mousam Banerjee.""Our puja theme will focus on how Bengali speakers are being illegally deported to Bangladesh and their basic rights being snatched, judging them on the basis of the language they speak,"" said Sanjay Das, chief organiser of the puja at Dum Dum Road Hanuman Mandir Jayashree Club.Bandhumahal is marking its 45th year with the theme 'Bangla o Bangali. Banglar Itihaas (Bengal and Bengalis. History of Bengal)'. The pandal will have installations of Rabindranath Tagore, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Raja Ram Mohan Roy.""Durga Puja is no longer limited to idol-viewing, offering prayers or grabbing a quick bite. Our festival is now honoured and admired on the world stage. That's why Puja theme ideas today are like complete thesis papers,"" said club secretary Swarup Nag.At Adarshapally, the focus is on filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak's works, particularly his film 'Meghe Dhaka Tara (The Cloud-Capped Star)'. Organisers say the theme draws parallels between the turmoil of Bengal during Ghatak's era and contemporary threats to Bengal's cultural fabric. ""It's about Bengal in peril - then and now,"" said organiser Shankar Ghosh.39 Pally Durgotsav Samiti's puja, primarily being organised by youths struggling with Down syndrome under the supervision of artist Snehasis Das, will focus on the theme of 'language terrorism'. ""In society's eyes, we are either outcasts or objects of pity. We wish to be tempered and hardened by the fiery struggles of life,"" an organiser said.","Several puja committees have decided to go big on themes underlining the heritage of Bengal.

The HC, one of the three first set up by the British, has 2,185 such cases yet to be disposed of, which is 94% of the total 2,329 cases pending for over 50 years across all HCs. And since last year, Calcutta HC has added 140 more to its docket.According to the pendency statistics released by Union law ministry on Thursday, there are 22,829 cases pending for 40-50 years at 25 HCs across country, another 63,239 for 30-40 years, over 3.4 lakh for 20-30 years and 11.5 lakh for 10-20 years.The oldest case in a high court is pending for 74 years, since 1951. Only eight HCs besides Calcutta have pendency of cases for over five decades - 56 in Madras HC, 46 in Patna HC, 17 in Allahabad HC, nine in Telangana HC, eight in Orissa HC, four in Madhya Pradesh HC, and two each in Bombay and Punjab & Haryana HCs.In comparison, the district judiciary has done better with only 1,113 cases pending for five decades, of which 39% are only from Bengal. The data was released by law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal in response to a question in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The total pendency of cases which are more than 10 years old is at 15,77,191.In response to another question on pendency of cases, Meghwal said several factors lead to long pendency, including ""complexity of the facts involved, nature of evidence, cooperation of stakeholders, viz.bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants, besides the availability of physical infrastructure, supporting court staff and proper application of rules and procedures to monitor, track and bunch hearing of cases"".He highlighted that pendency of cases and vacancy for judges in HCs are not necessarily directly related - as of Aug 1, against the sanctioned strength of 1,122 judges in HCs, the working strength was at 778, with 344 vacancies. ""Against these vacancies, 138 proposals for appointment of judges are at various stages of processing between govt and SC Collegium,"" Meghwal said. Govt has not yet received any recommendation against 206 vacancies, he added.This seems to have escaped the attention of the higher judiciary, notwithstanding SC issuing from time to time directives to all HCs to ensure that pendency of all cases over 10 years old is cleared on priority basis.As reported by TOI, govt had set up National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms in Aug 2011 with the objective of improving legal access by reducing delays and arrears in the system and enhancing accountability through structural changes and by setting performance standards and capacities. Separate arrears committees have also been set up at all 25 HCs to clear cases pending for more than five years. Similar committees are functional at district courts.","The oldest case in a high court is pending for 74 years, since 1951.

Decline of traditional western influence

US, UK no longer the powerhouses

India’s passport has climbed several ranks in the latest Henley Passport Index list of the world’s most powerful or strongest passports. The strength of Indian passport has increased substantially in recent times, enabling Indians to access more than 60 nations without prior visa arrangements or through visa-on-arrival facilities.Interestingly, an assessment of the Henley Passport Index in a TOI report shows that amongst the passports of approximately 200 countries the conventional leaders such as the US and the UK have declined in rankings, whilst Asian nations have emerged as the new frontrunners in passport privileges.The Indian passport's position has seen a marginal improvement from the previous year, although its performance over extended periods shows considerable variations. The present standing is actually lower than its position ten years prior. The highest position achieved was number 71 in 2006, the TOI report said.Whilst India currently holds the 77th position in the latest rankings, it lags behind 147 nations regarding the count of destinations where its citizens can access visa-free travel or obtain visa-on-arrival privileges.For Indian passport holders, Africa and South-East Asia present the most accessible international destinations.Besides unrestricted entry to certain neighbouring nations, Indians can visit many African and South-East Asian countries through simplified visa-on-arrival schemes or electronic visa applications.The duration of visa-free stays varies across nations:The accessibility breakdown shows:* 26 countries offer visa-free entry* 38 countries provide visa-on-arrival* 41 countries accept e-visa applicationsIndians enjoy straightforward visa access to more than 100 nations, including those offering e-visas. Among South Asian nations, Bhutan ranks 84th globally in passport strength, whilst Bangladesh (94th), Nepal (95th) and Pakistan (96th) occupy similar positions. Sri Lanka stands at 91st position. China, India's northern neighbour, holds the 60th position, offering visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 83 destinations.Citizens from Singapore, Japan and South Korea currently enjoy visa-free or visa-on-arrival privileges to more than 190 destinations worldwide. Their sustained international relations, economic partnerships and worldwide connectivity have established their dominance in passport strength.

RAICHUR: A 60-year-old beggar from Bijanagera village, along the Raichur-Jambaladinni Road, donated ₹1.83 lakh for the renovation of the local Anjaneyaswamy temple. The funds were accumulated entirely from the alms she collected over the last six years.The temple was recently dedicated to the public, and Rangamma was felicitated of her contribution. Rangamma, originally from Andhra Pradesh, has been residing in Bijanagera for the last 35 years. She has been sustaining herself entirely through begging.For the past six years, she meticulously stacked up all the alms she collected in three gunny bags.A few weeks ago, villagers, who have been supporting her with food and clothing, built a modest 4x5 ft tinroof shelter for her.The Rs 1 lakh needed to build the shelter was funded by Rangamma, using part of the money she had collected from begging.However, when she moved to her new dwelling, the villagers discovered the three cash-stashed gunny bags. Upon questioning, Rangamma said she intended to donate all that money to the temple.Thereafter, she called some of the village elders to count the contents of the bags. More than 20 villagers toiled for nearly six hours before coming up with the final figure: Rs 1.83 lakh.In addition, Rs 6,000 worth of currency notes were damaged due to dampness.“According to Rangamma’s wish, we have used that money for renovation of the temple,” said Basavaraj Yadav, secretary of Anjaneyaswamy temple service committee. Rangamma primarily begs from bikers, auto drivers and other motorists.She said: “Drivers, shop owners and small traders give me Rs 10, Rs 20, and sometimes Rs 100. The money I contributed to the temple was all collected in this way.”","Rangamma, originally from Andhra Pradesh, has been residing in Bijanagera for the last 35 years.

ROORKEE: In what is being alleged to be a significant data privacy lapse, personal information of more than 30,000 students and alumni of IIT-Roorkee has been exposed on a public website for years, prompting the institute to launch an internal inquiry. The data, believed to have been electronically siphoned from the institute's academic affairs department records, was accessible to all, raising concerns over internal cyber safeguards at one of the country's premier engineering institutes.The leaked database contains mobile numbers of students and their parents, caste category, financial background, email addresses, and year of admission and graduation. By entering a student's enrolment number on the site, one could view their personal details, including photographs. ""Since the information on the website can be retrieved only through an enrolment number, it means the data has either been leaked or stolen from the academic affairs section. This is clearly a case of cyber security and personal privacy breach,"" said a professor on condition of anonymity.When TOI alerted the institute about the breach, it ordered an inquiry.""We have forwarded the matter to dean academic affairs and dean of student welfare for necessary action,"" said UP Singh, deputy director of IIT-R.The website is believed to have been running for about 10 years. Although it had not uploaded data for the current year, older records were reportedly being updated. ""It is extremely serious that the website operator is sharing vital personal information of institute's students from an unknown place, and for unknown purposes. Unfortunately, the institute is not yet aware of it,"" said a student.Officials did not divulge the names of the students and alumni affected. The institute has a rich history of producing distinguished engineers, scientists and industry leaders. Established in 1847 as the Thomason College of Civil Engineering, IIT-Roorkee is Asia's oldest technical institution. It became the University of Roorkee in 1949 and was upgraded to an IIT in 2001.","Personal information of more than 30,000 students and alumni of IIT-Roorkee has been exposed on a public website.

Bengaluru Rains: Heavy rain causes flooding in Bengaluru’s Manyata Tech Park area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/heavy-rain-causes-flooding-in-bengalurus-manyata-tech-park-area/articleshow/123222970.cms,"City Flooded, Roads Waterlogged As Heavy Rainfall Drowns Bengaluru, BJP Slams Cong Govt

Bengaluru: Heavy rain led to flooding inside Manyata Tech Park, one of the city's largest IT hubs, and on its surrounding roads Sunday. Seventeen trees across the city were uprooted in the downpour.The rain caused water to rush through the internal roads of the tech park and pool near the ramp that ends inside. Being a Sunday, problems due to flooding were relatively limited.BBMP received a total of 49 complaints — 17 for uprooted trees and 32 for fallen branches. According to the civic agency, 38 of these complaints have been cleared. Yelahanka and Byatarayanapura were the worst-affected, reporting six cases each, including both tree and branch falls. Other affected areas included Hebbal, Mahadevapura, KR Pura, Jayanagar, and parts of the west zone. One car was damaged in Sahakaranagar.A ramp near Hebbal towards airport road was waterlogged, but civic teams were seen working to clear the blockage.According to India Meteorological Department, the city recorded 13.5mm of rain at HAL Airport and 12.3mm at the Bengaluru City observatory.Built on a low-lying patch of land that was once part of the city's interconnected lake system, the Manyata Tech Park area is susceptible to waterlogging when stormwater drains overflow or become blocked, especially during heavy rains.The civic body last month issued a notice to Manyata Promoters Pvt Ltd and other property owners in the Nagawara area, directing them to clear alleged encroachments on a stormwater drain linked to the tech park premises.The July 9 notice, issued by the Yelahanka zone commissioner, followed a total station survey that marked the original path of the drain in the presence of stakeholders. Acting on directions from the principal secretary, revenue department, BBMP instructed that the encroachments be removed and work on restoring the drain commence from July 10 without fail.Disruption and traffic jams due to heavy rain were limited on Sunday compared to a regular weekday, according to traffic police. There was complete waterlogging at Ramamurthy Nagar single road, forcing vehicles to move at a crawl. Other stretches in the city, including Thanisandra to Nagawara junction, City Market Circle to SJP Circle, Bagalur Cross to IAF Junction, Hebbal to the airport, Hebbal towards the city, and Devinagar to Kuvempu Circle in both directions, also experienced slow-moving traffic.","Heavy rain led to flooding inside Manyata Tech Park, one of the city's largest IT hubs, and on its surrounding roads Sunday.

"Anand Mahindra reacts to Trump’s tariffs: ""India should seize this moment like 'Amrit' from a global Manthan""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/anand-mahindra-reacts-to-trumps-tariffs-india-should-seize-this-moment-like-amrit-from-a-global-manthan/articleshow/123166411.cms,"Reforms, not reactions: What Anand Mahindra suggests India must do

Unleashing the power of tourism as a forex engine

A broader economic agenda for resilience and growth

Learning from unintended global consequences

Turning adversity into advantage

In the wake of US President Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on Indian imports, industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India. Drawing a powerful analogy from Indian mythology, Mahindra urged the nation to extract 'Amrit', opportunity and growth, from the 'Manthan' or global churn caused by escalating trade wars. He emphasized that instead of viewing the tariffs as a setback, India should treat them as a catalyst for internal reforms, economic acceleration, and a repositioning of its global image as a trusted investment destination.According to Mahindra, incremental reforms are no longer sufficient. He emphasized the need for India to radically improve its ease of doing business, beginning with a truly functional single-window clearance system for all investment proposals. While acknowledging that states control many investment-related regulations, he proposed forming a coalition of willing states that align with a central national platform to demonstrate India’s ability to move with speed, simplicity, and predictability.Such measures, Mahindra believes, will not only help neutralize the impact of tariffs but also transform India into a magnet for global capital. In a world where trusted partnerships are in high demand, India has a unique opportunity to present itself as a dependable, long-term destination for investors.Mahindra also flagged tourism as a massively underutilized asset in India’s economic strategy. He called for the urgent need to accelerate visa processing, improve infrastructure for foreign visitors, and create dedicated tourism corridors around existing hotspots. These corridors, he said, must prioritize security, sanitation, and hygiene to attract international travelers and serve as templates for other regions.Tourism, Mahindra argued, has the potential to generate enormous foreign exchange, boost local employment, and revitalize India’s image on the world stage if treated as a strategic sector.Mahindra did not stop at investment and tourism. He laid out a broader framework aimed at ensuring long-term economic resilience. Key priorities include liquidity support for MSMEs, acceleration of infrastructure investment, and a manufacturing push through the enhancement and expansion of the PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) schemes.He also urged policymakers to rationalize import duties, especially those on raw materials and components critical to manufacturing, to help make Indian products globally competitive.In his remarks, Mahindra highlighted how other countries are using the global tariff war to address long-standing economic inefficiencies. Germany, for example, is rethinking its fiscal orthodoxy, opening doors to greater defense and infrastructure spending, while Canada is making efforts to break down long-standing internal trade barriers.These examples, he suggested, show how external pressure can trigger internal transformation. For India, the question is whether it can also use this moment of global churn to create positive, long-term consequences for its own economy.Mahindra concluded his remarks with a message that balanced realism with optimism. Acknowledging that nations like the US will always prioritize their own interests, he stressed that India should be no different. The goal, he said, should not be to complain but to adapt, reform, and rise. After all, every challenge is just an opportunity in disguise—sometimes wearing a slightly grumpy face. If the world throws tariffs, maybe it's time we throw back innovation.“Just as the 1991 forex reserves crisis triggered liberalization,” Mahindra wrote, “can today’s global manthan over tariffs yield some ‘amrit’ for us?” His call to action was clear: let India use this moment to shape its own destiny intentionally, ambitiously, and decisively.","Industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:Gold prices surged to an all-time high on the domestic front last week, driven by rate cut expectations, weaker US jobs report and tariff related uncertainties. Dollar index was in a narrow range of ~98-~99 similarly, US Yields also witnessed some pressure, amidst a strong consumer confidence data was overshadowed by soft July job growth and downward revisions to past payrolls, pointing to a weakening labor market supporting bullion in the previous week.Confusion erupted towards the end of last week after reports of a 39% US tariff on Swiss 1 kg and 100 ounce gold bars, initially spiking prices before the White House clarified the news was false, triggering a pullback. Meanwhile, President Trump announced plans to meet Russian President Putin on August 15 to discuss ending the Ukraine war, while trade talks with China face an August 12 deadline.Trump is also expected to nominate first economist Miran as Fed Governor after Powell’s retirement.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A United Airlines pilot refused to fly from San Francisco to Cancun, Mexico, after a passenger smoked weed in the front bathroom.

The pilot was scared that he would be positive on a drug test from second-hand exposure to marijuana. ""I have 30 years left of my career at United.

A bizarre incident took place in the United Kingdom where a grocery shopper was taken to hospital after she was reportedly knocked unconscious after a cauliflower fell on her head.Sammi Mai, 42, a resident of Kingston-upon-Thames said that a discounted cauliflower fell from a height of four to six feet, striking her on the back of her head. The impact caused her to fall and lose consciousness.Mai, who spoke to GB News about the incident, stated, ""Suddenly a really large and heavy item fell down on the top of my head, and hit my head. I fell and when I woke up, I was suffering [from a] concussion and was knocked out.""The shopper, who also shared her story with the Sun, revealed that she continues to experience various symptoms, including neck pain and anxiety, which have negatively affected her health and ability to work.Expressing her concerns about the store's handling of the situation, Mai said, ""I was very unwell, and I'm still suffering and unable to work. I don't know how the cauliflower fell but they should not store heavy, roundish items like that on the top shelf.""She also noted that the staff simply returned the cauliflower to the top shelf, suggesting that they did not take the incident seriously. As a result, Mai is considering taking legal action against the grocery chain.Expressing her dissatisfaction with the supermarket's handling of the situation, Mai stated, ""she was disappointed by the supermarket's response."" Furthermore, she mentioned that she had not utilised the gift card provided by the establishment.In response to the incident, a Waitrose spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""Our customer was seen immediately by a trained first-aider at the time of the accident, and we are sorry to hear she is unwell. We take customer safety incredibly seriously and have thoroughly investigated this case – but will consider any new information she wishes to share with us.""Dr Marc Siegel, a Fox News medical contributor, explained that while a significant brain injury is unlikely to result from a soft object like a cauliflower falling from a height of four feet, it is not impossible. He also noted that neck pain and nausea are common symptoms following a blow to the head, even if a concussion is unlikely given the circumstances.Dr Siegel advised anyone experiencing symptoms such as headache, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, or confusion after a blow to the head to seek medical attention, as these could indicate a possible concussion. In such cases, a CT or MRI may be required, and the individual should decrease their activity while experiencing these symptoms.","Sammi Mai, 42, a resident of Kingston-upon-Thames said that a discounted cauliflower fell from a height of four to six feet, striking her on the back of her head.

Macao's former top judge elected as Chinese casino hub's first leader born in mainland China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/macaos-former-top-judge-elected-as-chinese-casino-hubs-first-leader-born-in-mainland-china/articleshow/114181238.cms,"Macao’s former top judge, Sam Hou Fai (AP Image)

MACAO : Macao’s former top judge, Sam Hou Fai , was chosen as the Chinese casino hub ’s next leader in a largely ceremonial election on Sunday, setting him up to become the city’s first chief executive born in mainland China.Almost the entire election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists — 394 of 398 — voted for Sam, the sole candidate, in a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families. The remaining four were blank votes.The shift in the city’s leadership to someone from the legal profession is likely to create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing’s policy agenda for the city will take priority.Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing’s blessings. During the nomination period, he had already secured endorsements from 386 election committee members who voted in batches in a conference hall on Sunday.Influential figures among the 400-strong committee were Shun Tak Holdings’ group executive chairperson Pansy Ho, daughter of late casino tycoon Stanley Ho, lawmaker Angela Leong, one of Ho's widows, and former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.Sam is expected to meet reporters later Sunday.Most of the territory’s 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can’t participate in.Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam’s non-local origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades.With Sam’s victory guaranteed, the real challenges await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead.Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy.Sam has promised to accelerate the current government’s plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say.China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before.It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable cabinet to tackle these pressing issues.Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China.When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city’s top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election.He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections.",Sam Hou Fai was chosen as the Chinese casino hub ’s next leader in a largely ceremonial election on Sunday.

A deadly storm and the road ahead

President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Florida after Hurricane Milton left a path of destruction across the Gulf Coast. As communities begin the difficult task of rebuilding, the state is facing a new hurdle: a critical fuel shortage . Many Floridians, some of whom had evacuated hundreds of miles to escape the storm’s wrath, spent much of Saturday scrambling for fuel, while long queues at gas stations became a common sight. The situation has hindered recovery efforts, with residents unable to return home or begin repairs due to the lack of fuel for vehicles and generators.In St. Petersburg, residents like Daniel Thornton waited for hours at a gas station, hoping for a delivery. ""They told me they have gas coming but they don’t know when it’s going to be here,"" Thornton, who was accompanied by his 9-year-old daughter Magnolia, told news agency AP. ""I have no choice. I have to sit here all day with her until I get gas."" Governor Ron DeSantis has pledged to address the crisis by opening multiple fuel distribution sites across the state, offering residents up to 10 gallons of fuel each while the fuel supply stabilises. ""As power is restored and the Port of Tampa reopens, you’ll see fuel begin to flow again,"" DeSantis explained.For many residents, the recovery from Milton is compounded by the damage already caused by Hurricane Helene just weeks before. In Venice, Bill O'Connell, a board member at Bahia Vista Gulf, expressed frustration after Milton undid much of the work done to repair properties after the previous storm. “Milton reflooded everything that was already flooded, brought the sand back onto our property, and caused severe wind damage,” O’Connell told AP, describing roofs ripped off and windows blown out across the complex.Similarly, the small fishing village of Cortez is still reeling from the combined effects of the two hurricanes. Local resident Mark Praught, whose home was flooded during Helene, now faces additional damage from Milton’s storm surge. “Everything is shot,” Praught remarked, as he worked to clear debris from his home of 36 years. ""We’ll replace the electrical and plumbing and go from there."" Despite these setbacks, the community has come together to help each other clear debris and begin the long process of rebuilding.Hurricane Milton, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, caused widespread flooding and spawned deadly tornadoes, claiming at least 16 lives across central Florida. The damage could have been far worse, officials say, were it not for the timely evacuations of residents. Over 1,000 people have been rescued as floodwaters and debris continue to disrupt daily life.President Biden is set to visit Florida on Sunday to survey the devastation firsthand. The visit coincides with his efforts to secure additional federal aid for affected communities. With recovery expected to take months, Biden emphasised the need for immediate congressional action to fund critical recovery programmes, urging lawmakers to ensure that FEMA and the Small Business Administration have the necessary resources to continue operations throughout hurricane season.","President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Florida after Hurricane Milton left a path of destruction across the Gulf Coast.

WASHINGTON: From holding back investments to considering moving abroad, businesses in the United States are bracing for more economic turbulence as the presidential campaign kicks into high gear -- with fresh tariffs rolled out and promises of more.Republican candidate Donald Trump has proposed at least a 10 percent tariff on imports and up to 60 percent on Chinese goods, intensifying levies he previously imposed on Beijing and others.Democratic nominee Kamala Harris , meanwhile, serves an administration that largely maintained Trump's tariffs and last month finalized further hikes on $18 billion of Chinese products.For Robert Actis, whose manufacturing business has been caught in the tariff maelstrom, the future has looked ""clouded"" over the past five years.Under Trump, he faced tariffs on steel and aluminum and has struggled to find alternative suppliers for raw materials not produced in the country.Fresh measures on the materials by the Biden-Harris administration have added to his woes.""I would be very happy to buy from a US producer,"" said Actis, who imports wires to make stucco netting used in construction, ""but there's no one willing to do it.""He has previously been granted tariff exemptions, but the annual applications are not always successful.Additional costs are gradually being passed to homebuilders, he said.- Millions in costs -US tariffs weigh on many industries. The American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) estimates retail prices have risen five percent to 10 percent annually since 2020.""Initially, our members tried to eat some of those costs by eating into their profits,"" said Nate Herman, AAFA's senior vice president for policy.But this has been tough.It is unclear that tariffs on China have returned production to the United States, as Trump argues, and at least 14 US textile mills have closed in recent years, Herman told AFP.Products like certain acrylic sweaters are not produced domestically either, requiring new machinery and trained workers, he said.""The average age in domestic factories has gone into the 50s because we just can't find workers willing to work in those factories,"" Herman added.""For a small company like us, it's millions of dollars"" in added costs, said Ray Sharrah, CEO of lighting products maker Streamlight.""We pay for it, our exporter helps, and ultimately the consumer (pays),"" he said. ""This is the problem with any tariff.""- 'Dampening effect' -Uncertainty looms as November's election approaches, but businesses prefer predicability.A September survey involving the Richmond and Atlanta Federal Reserve banks found that 30 percent of firms reported postponing, scaling down, delaying or canceling investment plans due to election uncertainty.""It stops you from action. It stops you from investment, and it just generally creates a dampening effect on all economic development,"" Sharrah said.With business partners, he has been trying to bring production of a major component back into the country -- but to no avail.""When we spend time reshuffling the supply chain deck, that's time we don't spend growing our business,"" he said.AAFA's Herman added that companies have been trying to find alternative sources but ""with mixed results.""He believes businesses will ramp up imports ahead of expected tariff hikes, as happened in 2018 when Trump engaged in a trade war with Beijing.""But again, if there's a global tariff imposed, then where do you go?"" Herman said.- Rhetoric or reality? -Businesses expect tariffs to stay no matter who wins the election.""If anything, it's probably going to go up,"" Actis said, adding that he has considered moving his business abroad.But he believes it is hard to predict what a candidate like Trump might do, saying, ""A lot of it is bombast.""Will Thomas of Colonial Metal Products said there is little businesses can do besides importing from diverse sources.""It seems that the presidential candidates want to say things that invoke emotion,"" he said.""However, if all these products aren't there, and you keep increasing the cost of the products, what happens? The costs go up, it's inflation.""At auto accessories importer Trim Illusion, President Colby McLaughlin is considering scaling up his business to boost margins.As a voter, he is torn between perspectives as a business owner and a citizen.""I'm not against a tariff, as long as there is a plan or support to help these companies bring the manufacturing back,"" he said.""For me, that's the piece that I haven't heard.""",US businesses are bracing for more economic turbulence as the presidential campaign kicks into high gear.

DHAKA: India has conveyed its displeasure to authorities over theft of the crown gifted by PM Modi for the legendary Jeshoreshwari Kali temple during his visit to Bangladesh.Sources said New Delhi was disturbed by the theft of the crown from the temple in Satkhira district. The Indian high commissioner in Bangladesh urged law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident, recover the crown and bring the guilty to book. ""We have seen reports of theft of the crown gifted by PM Modi to Jeshoreshwari Kali temple (Satkhira) in 2021 during his visit to Bangladesh,"" the high commission said in a message.The temple is one of the 52 Shakti Peeths in Hinduism and during his visit, Modi had placed the crown on the head of the deity, Goddess Kali, as a mark of reverence. Importantly, Thursday was the seventh day of Durga puja when the goddess is worshipped as Kalratri, one of the forms of Kali.The theft coincided with the recitation of Islamic songs by a group, including two clerics, at a Durga puja pandal in Chattogram. The songs included one proclaiming the universal victory of the Islamic revolution.The theft has heightened fears gripping Hindus after the regime change in Aug, putting a question mark on chief advisor Mohammad Yunus's promise to provide security to the minority community and safeguard their rights.Anger among Hindus ran high in Chattogram after a group of six, including Shahidul Karim, who teaches at Tanzimul Ummah Madrasa, and Mohammad Nurul Islam, a teacher of Darul Irfan Academy, recited Islamic songs after misleading the organisers. The group was allowed on the dais after they told the organisers that they intended to sing nationalist songs.The two clerics have been detained. The six are members of Chattogram Cultural Academy, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami body, according to sources. Jamaat, however, denied any links with those detained.Chattogram deputy commissioner Farida Khanom visited the puja venue Thursday and assured that the administration would nab the absconding accused within 48 hours.The puja committee expelled two of its senior functionaries for not being vigilant enough. The anger was shared by others. ""Why would an Islamic group sing in a puja celebration? Who gave them this right? Sure, this is intentional,"" music director and song writer Prince Mahmud wrote on Facebook.","Sources said New Delhi was disturbed by the theft of the crown from the temple.

An 18-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nima Rinji Sherpa set a new world record by becoming the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.As per the news agency ANI, his historic feat was completed on Wednesday when he successfully scaled Tibet's 8,027-metre-high Shisha Pangma , marking the culmination of his two-year mission to conquer the most daunting mountains on the planet.Summiting all 14 ""eight-thousanders"" is considered the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, requiring climbers to cross into ""death zones,"" where oxygen levels are too low to support human life for long periods. Nima’s success at such a young age has been hailed as a remarkable testament to his strength and determination.Looking back at his journey, Nima posted about the achievement on his Instagram page. He said, ""This summit is not just the culmination of my personal journey, but a tribute to every Sherpa who has ever dared to dream beyond the traditional boundaries set for us. Mountaineering is more than labour; it is a testament to our strength, resilience, and passion.""Wanting this feat to be an inspiration for the younger generation, he further said, ""Through #SherpaPower, I want to show the younger generation of Sherpas that they can rise above the stereotype of being only support climbers and embrace their potential as top-tier athletes, adventurers, and creators. We are not just guides; we are trailblazers. Let this be a call to every Sherpa to see the dignity in our work, the power in our heritage, and the limitless possibilities in our future.""""To humanity as a whole: let this climb remind us that the peaks we reach together, united, are far greater than any individual achievement. As a teenager, witnessing the division caused by borders, wars, racism and other conflicts, I call for love, respect, and harmony among all people. In this vast world, we are but one human race. No summit, no boundary, no conflict is worth more than the peace and unity we can achieve by understanding and supporting one another,"" he added.Then he called out to the people to preserve nature and said, ""The mountain does not define us; we define the mountain We are its guardians, similarly the world we live in should be defined by people who reside in it ! Let’s all unite to protect and preserve our natural resources to live a sustainable and adventurous life!""Nima Rinji hails from a family of renowned mountaineers.He reached the summit of Shisha Pangma early in the morning, accompanied by fellow climber Pasang Nurbu Sherpa. ""He reached the summit this morning. He had trained well, and I was confident he would do it,"" said his father, Tashi Sherpa, while expressing pride in his son’s accomplishment.The President of the Nepal Mountaineering Association , Nima Nuru Sherpa also expressed his happiness at Rinji’s achievement. “This is a proud moment for our country. Nima broke all the stereotypes, and his success has given a message that nothing is impossible if you have a strong determination"".Nima Rinji began his mountaineering career in earnest in August 2022 when he summited Mount Manaslu at the age of 16. By June 2024, he had successfully climbed his 13th mountain, Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. His ascent of Shisha Pangma on October 9, 2024, completed his record-breaking achievement.The record for the youngest person to summit all 14 peaks was previously held by Mingma Gyabu 'David' Sherpa, who achieved the feat at the age of 30 in 2019. Nima Rinji, however, accomplished the same feat at just 18 years and five months, completing his journey in two years and ten days, according to Seven Summit Treks, the expedition organiser.Nepali climbers, particularly Sherpas, have long been considered the backbone of the climbing industry in the Himalayas, often carrying equipment and setting up routes for foreign climbers. However, in recent years, Sherpas have gained recognition in their own right, taking centre stage in some of the most challenging climbs.","Nima Rinji Sherpa is the youngest person to summit all 14 of the world's peaks that rise above 8,000 metres.
