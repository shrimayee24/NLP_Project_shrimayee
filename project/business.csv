Pahalgam terror attack: What is Indus Water Treaty and how will its suspension impact Pakistan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-terror-attack-what-is-indus-water-treaty-and-how-will-its-suspension-impact-pakistan/articleshow/120557713.cms,"What is Indus Waters Treaty?



How does the Indus Waters Treaty works?



Why was the treaty needed?



How will Indus Water Treaty suspension impact Pakistan?



The Indus River network, comprising the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, serves as Pakistan's principal water resource, supporting a population of tens of millions.

The treaty will impact Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan, especially in the provincesof Punjab and Sindh.

Pakistan relies substantially on this water supply for irrigation, farming and potable water.

The agricultural sector contributes 23% to Pakistan's national income and supports 68% of its rural inhabitants.

The Indus basin supplies 154.3 million acre-feet of water yearly, which is vital for irrigating extensive agricultural areas and ensuring food security.

Any interruption to water flow would significantly impact Pakistan's agricultural sector, a crucial component of its economy and rural livelihoods.

Reduced water availability will likely lead to lower crop yields, food shortages, and economic instability in rural areas dependent on farming.

Pakistan already faces critical water management issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity.

issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity. The country’s water storage capacity is low, with major dams like Mangla and Tarbela having a combined live storage of only about 14.4 MAF, which is just 10% of Pakistan’s annual water share under the treaty.

The suspension exacerbates these vulnerabilities by cutting off a guaranteed water supply, leaving Pakistan with fewer options to manage its water needs.

NEW DELHI: India suspended the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan on Wednesday in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack . This move was one of five major decisions made during a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Indus Water Treaty (IWT), signed on September 19, 1960, between India and Pakistan, is seen as a key example of cross-border water-sharing.It was brokered by the World Bank after nine years of talks and signed by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan’s President Ayub Khan to manage shared rivers.According to the agreement, India has control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan gets the waters from the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.The treaty benefits Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow from these rivers, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan , especially in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.According to the World Bank, the treaty set up a framework for fair and cooperative management of the Indus River system , which is essential for agriculture, drinking water, and industry in both India and Pakistan.It outlined clear guidelines for the equitable sharing of the river and its tributaries to ensure both nations could meet their water needs.The treaty gave India control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan was given the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.However, both countries are allowed limited use of the rivers assigned to the other for specific purposes like irrigation and power generation.When British India was divided in 1947, the Indus River system—which starts in Tibet and flows through both India and Pakistan, also touching parts of Afghanistan and China—became a source of tension.In 1948, India temporarily stopped the flow of water to Pakistan, leading Pakistan to raise the issue with the United Nations. The UN recommended involving a neutral third party, prompting the World Bank to step in and mediate.After years of negotiations, the Indus Water Treaty was finally signed in 1960 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistani President Ayub Khan to peacefully manage and share the vital river system.Also read: 5 big CCS decisions taken by India following Pahalgam terror attack The treaty's suspension would considerably affect Pakistan, as this agreement regulates the usage and allocation of water from the Indus River system and its tributaries, which are essential for Pakistan's water requirements and agricultural sector.","India suspended the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan on Wednesday in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack.

How closing Attari border will impact trade?

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the central government on Wednesday suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan — one of five key decisions taken at the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""The CCS reviewed the overall security situation and directed all forces to maintain high vigil. It resolved that perpetrators of this attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror or conspired to make them possible,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misry.Attari, located just 28 kilometres from Amritsar, is India’s first Land Port and the only permitted land route for trade with Pakistan. Spread across 120 acres and directly connected to national highway-I, the check post has played a crucial role in cross-border trade, particularly in imports from Afghanistan.The Attari-Wagah corridor has witnessed fluctuating figures in trade and passenger movement over the years. In 2023-24, the land port recorded trade worth Rs 3,886.53 crore with 6,871 cargo movements and 71,563 passenger crossings.The Attari Land Port has long served as a critical trade conduit between India and Pakistan, handling a variety of goods. Key Indian exports through the route include soybean, chicken feed, vegetables, red chilies, plastic dana, and plastic yarn. On the other side, imports from Pakistan and beyond have largely comprised dry fruits, dry dates, gypsum, cement, glass, rock salt, and various herbs.The closure of the port is expected to significantly impact the movement of these goods, particularly affecting small traders and manufacturers who rely on this cross-border exchange. However, volumes have generally declined since 2018-19, reflecting ongoing tensions and disruptions.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh had assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.",The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's Army chief General Asim Munir's recent dog-whistle - wherein he termed Kashmir as Pakistan's ""jugular vein"" - is being seen as among the possible triggers for Lashkar-e-Taiba 's terror attack in Pahalgam coinciding with the visit of US vice president JD Vance , sources said.While agencies have yet to form a definitive assessment, multiple intelligence officers said there were indicators that Munir's provocative address, in which he also focused on the differential treatment of Muslims and Hindus, may have emboldened The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of LeT, which has claimed responsibility for the attack, to plan a ""spectacular strike"".LeT's top commander Saifullah Kasuri, alias Khalid, is suspected to be one of the plotters, according to an intelligence assessment. The role of two Rawalkot-based Lashkar commanders, one of whom is Abu Musa, is also under scrutiny, sources said.On April 18, Musa organised an event in Rawalkot where he said, ""Jihad will continue, guns will rage and beheading will continue in Kashmir. India wants to change demography of Kashmir by giving domicile certificates to non locals."" Many of the victims in Pahalgam were asked to recite the 'kalma' (Islamic phrase of declaration of faith), and those who could not were shot dead.TOI had reported last week that the Indian intelligence establishment viewed the anti-Hindu rhetoric as a calculated move - coinciding with protests against changes to the Waqf Act - to motivate Pakistan-based terrorists to regroup.The preliminary assessment of the intelligence agencies is that around sixterrorists, supported by local auxiliaries, carried out the attack. ""It seems the attackers arrived a few days prior to the attack, conducted reconnaissance, and then struck when they saw an opportunity. In early April (1-7), there were inputs that terrorists had conducted reconnaissance of some hotels. So, there wasn't an intelligence failure,"" a source said.","Pakistan's Army chief General Asim Munir's recent dog-whistle is being seen as among the possible triggers for Lashkar-e-Taiba's terror attack in Pahalgam.

Jharkhand HC yet to deliver verdicts reserved 3 years ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-hc-yet-to-deliver-verdicts-reserved-3-years-ago/articleshow/120565962.cms,"NEW DELHI: Constitutional courts fix deadlines for everyone, including the President, but no such limitation applies to them for pronouncing judgments. Four murder convicts moved Supreme Court on Wednesday alleging that Jharkhand HC has not delivered verdicts in their appeals even though decisions were reserved three years ago.Appearing for the four appellants incarcerated for 16 to 11 years, advocate Fauzia Shakil informed a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh that they had filed appeals, one in 2012, two in 2014 and one in 2018, and Jharkhand HC had reserved verdicts in their cases in the months of Jan, April, May and June of 2022. Despite lapse of three years, verdicts are yet to be pronounced, she said.The bench took serious view of the lapse and issued notice to Jharkhand HC registrar general, asking him to furnish in 10 days details about the pending appeals, the judges who had heard the appeals and the years for which judgments have been reserved.SC can rectify or take remedial measures when HCs reserve verdicts for an unusually long period of time but could it do anything when a judgment gets reserved for months together by an SC bench?

The bench also issued notice to Jharkhand govt and sought its response on bail plea .The first petitioner, 72-year-old Pila Pahan, was arrested on Jan 9, 2009, in a murder case and was awarded life imprisonment upon conviction in 2012.

In total he has been imprisoned for over 14 years. The fourth petitioner, Dharmeshwar Oraon, was convicted in a 2013 rape case in 2018, and his appeal is pending for last seven years in the HC. He has been imprisoned for the last nearly 12 years.The petition came as a shock to Justice Kant, who as head of the SC Legal Services Committee had recently taken a countrywide initiative in coordination with national, state and district legal services authorities to provide legal aid to every prisoner whose cases are being delayed in trial courts or for those who are not able to put forth their bail plea before the courts.","Four murder convicts moved Supreme Court on Wednesday alleging that Jharkhand HC has not delivered verdicts in their appeals even though decisions were reserved three years ago.

NEW DELHI: Asserting that India will be unrelenting in its pursuit of those who commit terrorist attacks against the country, the govt announced a series of measures to impose costs on Islamabad for its support to cross-border terrorism , including the suspension of World Bank-backed Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.The govt also shut down the Attari border with Pakistan in Amritsar, expelled the Pakistani air, navy and army advisors declaring them persona non grata and cut down the strength of the high commissions from the already downgraded 55 to 30. The posts of defence advisors were annulled by India and five support staff of the service advisors withdrawn from both high commissions. India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.After a CCS meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi, foreign secretary Vikram Misri also announced that Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) visas. ""Any SVES visas issued in the past to Pakistani nationals are deemed cancelled. Any Pakistani national currently in India under SVES visa has 48 hours to leave India,'' he said. In the CCS meeting, Misri said, the cross-border linkages of the Pahalgam terrorist attack were brought out and was noted that this attack came in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.Speaking about India's response to the attack, which came in the middle of important Indian engagements with the US and Saudi Arabia, govt sources suggested the actions announced were only indicative and not exhaustive, as all options, including ""kinetic action"", remained on the table.In the absence of any substantive bilateral engagement with Pakistan for almost a decade, exchanges between the two countries had been limited to talks under the IWT framework for irrigation and hydropower development and cooperation at the SCO forum.India had not discontinued engagements under the IWT mainly because of the involvement of the World Bank, a co-signatory to the treaty, but it had twice issued notice to Pakistan in the recent past for a review and modification of the treaty. Last year, it cited the effect of persistent cross-border terror attacks as one of the reasons for seeking a review of the treaty.President Donald Trump in a conversation with Modi condemned the attack and offered full support for efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. The support for India from the international community so far has been overwhelming, with all countries, including China, condemning the attack Pakistan denied any link with the worst attack on civilians in India in years, choosing to describe it as ""home-grown"".Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif said the top civilian and military leadership will meet on Thursday to formulate an appropriate response to India's move to suspend the IWT and downgrade diplomatic ties. ""A session of the National Security Committee will be held under the chair of PM Shehbaz Sharif,"" he said. Misri said strong expressions of support and solidarity were received from many govts around the world, which unequivocally condemned the terror attack, and the CCS recorded its appreciation for such sentiments, which reflect zero tolerance for terrorism.""The CCS condemned the attack in the strongest terms and expressed its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and hoped for the early recovery of the injured,'' Misri said, adding that the CCS also reviewed the overall security situation and directed all forces to maintain high vigil. ""It resolved that the perpetrators of the attack will be brought to justice and their sponsors held to account. As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror, or conspired to make them possible,"" Misri said.","India suspends World Bank-backed Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) until Pakistan abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.

There are a variety of military options, short of a full-blown war, on the table. It's for the political leadership to take the final call. If there is a go-ahead, then the retaliatory strikes will be at a time and place of our choosing,"" a senior military officer told TOI after a flurry of top-level meetings on Wednesday.The hard-nosed intent for cross-border retaliation , in keeping with the Modi govt's self-avowed muscular image on national security issues, was also evident when defence minister Rajnath Singh addressed an IAF event in the afternoon. There would be swift and strong action against not only the terrorists involved in the Pahalgam massacre, but also the orchestrators behind the scenes who conspired to carry out the heinous act on Indian soil, he said.There is realisation among the military brass here that Pakistan will not be caught off-guard like it was during the Balakot air strikes in Feb 2019 or the earlier ground-based ' surgical strikes ' to take out four ' terror launch pads ' across the Line of Control (LoC) in Sept 2016. With the well-equipped Pakistan military being no pushover, the pros and cons of every option, along with the escalation matrix, will have to be factored into the decision-making.Military officers, on their part, contend that ""carefully-calibrated precision air strikes"" against non-state targets by fighters like Rafales, Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKIs - armed with long-range weapons like the French 'Scalp' air-to-ground cruise missiles, Israeli Crystal Maze missiles and Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs - remain ""the best and most effective option"".""One can always achieve the element of surprise on Day-1 with airborne strikes. The day after the Balakot strikes, Pakistan managed to surprise the IAF with its 'Operation Swift Retort' because we let our guard down. Lessons have been learnt,"" another senior officer said.Govt will have to be fully prepared for escalation if it decides to go for air strikes. A less-escalatory tactical option will be to break the ongoing ceasefire with Pakistan along the 778-km LoC, which has largely held since it was renewed in Feb 2021. This will involve targeted firings by artillery guns and heavy mortars as well as concerted sniping and other such operations to disrupt their patrols in forward areas. ""All this can be very effective in raising the costs for the other side,"" an officer said.Then, there are shallow raids that can be conducted to destroy the makeshift terror launch pads that are generally located close to Pak army posts to ensure terrorists can cross the LoC in a single night. As per latest estimates, there are 110-120 terrorists present in 42 launch pads along the LoC, with 32 of them being south of the Pir Panjal range and 10 in the north. ""Terror launch pads close to LoC can be good targets,"" the officer said.If it comes to escalation, then the artillery barrages can be supplemented by longer-range standoff weapons like the 90-km range Smerch and 45-km Pinaka rocket systems and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450 km.",The hard-nosed intent for cross-border retaliation was also evident when defence minister Rajnath Singh addressed an IAF event in the afternoon.

NEW DELHI: With parallels being drawn between the terrorist attack at the picnic spot in Pahalgam and the Oct 7 attack carried out by the terror outfit Hamas in Israel, intelligence sources have pointed to multiple visits by senior Hamas functionaries to Pakistan over the past year.A Hamas team recently visited Jaish-e-Muhammed’s headquarters in Bahawalpur besides a Pakistani Army facility, which houses their combat simulation centre, inaugurated by Army chief Asim Munir last month. The area hosts the Bahawalpur Corps, a Pakistani military formation tasked with border defence and rapid deployment due to its strategic proximity to Rajasthan.In Feb, top Lashkar-e-Taiba and JeM cadres gathered in Rawalakote, PoK, on ‘ Kashmir Solidarity Day ’ for a speech by senior Hamas functionaries, sources said. The gathering, organized under the banner of Al Aqsa Floods — a reference to the mosque in Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Jews and Muslims and has long been an inflammable point of discord — was addressed by Hamas spokesperson Khalid Qaddoumi. Agencies here viewed the event as an attempt to link their jihadi campaign in J&K with the Palestinian fight against Israel, framing both as a “resistance against occupation”.There have been clear indications of Hamas’s increased presence in Pakistan in the last one year, especially after its Oct 7 terror attack on Israel in 2023.Last year in Jan, Qaddoumi was invited to address Pakistan Parliament. Significantly, welcoming Qaddoumi, a Pakistani lawmaker had claimed that India and Israel had planned an economic corridor — the Indian Middle East Eurpean Corridor — aimed at countering the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). “That plan is now buried under the rubble of Gaza,” he gloated.Hamas leaders’ visit to Pakistan came soon after Ismail Haniyeh, the then chief of Hamas, had sought help from Pakistan in their fight against Israel. When Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, prompting Pakistan to declare a national day of mourning.“Hamas leaders also held an ‘al-Aqsa million march’ in Karachi last year. Qaddoumi referred to Pakistan as an ‘elder brother’ in gratitude to Islamabad for agreeing to host 15 Palestinian prisoners freed under a ceasefire deal reached between Israel and Hamas,” a source recalled.","There have been clear indications of Hamas’s increased presence in Pakistan in the last one year, especially after its Oct 7 terror attack on Israel in 2023.

Kash Patel under scrutiny for taking FBI jets to NHL games



Is the FBI's air travel policy overdue for an update?



Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel has come under scrutiny for his frequent use of government planes for travel that seems to mix official business with personal interests—such as high-profile sporting events and excursions to his girlfriend's hometown. Since becoming FBI Director on February 21, Patel, 45, has accumulated a travel schedule that includes Nashville and Long Island, raising questions about the intersection of professional duty and personal convenience.Kashyap Pramod ""Kash"" Patel made at least three round-trip flights from Washington to Nashville, Tennessee, on Department of Justice-owned Gulfstream jets, The New York Times reported. Nashville is home to 26-year-old country singer Alexis Wilkins, Kash Patel's reported girlfriend. He also flew to Long Island on a DOJ Boeing 757 on April 6—to watch Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin score NHL history.While it's true that FBI directors must travel on government planes because of secure communication requirements, the timing and nature of several of Kash Patel's trips are raising questions as to whether tax dollars are being spent wisely. While Patel did meet with local FBI personnel, Tennessee legislators, and law enforcement officials during the trip, the reason for the other two trips is unknown.Meanwhile, flight logs show a DOJ-owned 757 flying to New York on the same day that Alex Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goal-scoring record on April 6—just two days after tying the record in Washington, D.C., another game Patel reportedly attended. Both events were high-profile NHL matchups, and while there’s no confirmation that Patel’s presence was for official reasons, the correlation has sparked concerns.Government employees who use federal planes are expected to pay the government back at the rate of a commercial ticket, which is much lower than flying in a private plane. Critics say this difference opens up a loophole that enables a level of luxury travel at little personal cost.Kash Patel has stood out from his predecessors at the FBI by being bold and visible as a public figure. He has proactively shared news of FBI operations and victories, breaking from the historically behind-the-scenes tradition of his predecessors. From tactical vest photo opportunities to social media cameos, Patel has gone full-on public.Patel has been the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2025. From February to April 2025, he also held the position of acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.Although Patel is not necessarily in breach of the current travel policy, the perception of his travels and the blurring of personal pleasure and official obligation will lead to additional examination of executive travel procedures. The FBI has just solicited proposals for a second jet to assist ‘required-use executive travel’, indicating present demand outstrips fleet size.Also read: 2025 NHL Playoffs: Winnipeg Jets ticket guide, full schedule, and key matchups for Stanley Cup run With Kash Patel still redefining the FBI Director position with his high-profile style and ambitious foreign travel schedule, there is growing pressure to be more open about how government resources are being expended—particularly in an era of heightened public concern regarding ethical governance.","FBI Director Kash Patel has come under scrutiny for his frequent use of government planes for travel that seems to mix official business with personal interests. Since becoming FBI Director on February 21, Patel, 45, has accumulated a travel schedule that includes Nashville and Long Island.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120520758,imgsize-23658,width-400,resizemode-4/FBI-Director-Kash-Patel.jpg"

In recent weeks, fans of both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have noticed their conspicuous absence from high-profile events like Coachella and various award shows. While the internet buzzed with speculation, a new theory has emerged — could Kelce’s lingering guilt from the Kansas City Chiefs ’ devastating loss in Super Bowl LIX be the real reason behind their low profile?Known for his fierce competitiveness and larger-than-life personality, Travis Kelce is no stranger to pressure. But after a crushing defeat in Super Bowl LIX, where the Chiefs fell short in a heart-wrenching overtime loss, sources close to the NFL star suggest he hasn’t quite shaken off the emotional weight.Despite putting on a brave face during post-game interviews, insiders reveal that Travis Kelce has been especially withdrawn since the loss. This self-imposed hiatus from the public eye could be a result of his personal disappointment and a desire to avoid media scrutiny.As Travis Kelce grapples with the aftermath, Taylor Swift has reportedly chosen to stay by his side rather than attend solo appearances.

Focus on core business areas

Poll Should Intel focus more on the AI sector to regain competitiveness? No, they should stick to traditional areas. Yes, it's crucial for growth.

Navigating a competitive landscape

Intel Corporation is reportedly planning to cut over 20% of its global workforce, according to a Bloomberg News report. The move is part of a major restructuring effort under the leadership of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan , who is spearheading a comprehensive effort to streamline management, eliminate bureaucracy, and rebuild an engineering-driven culture at the embattled chipmaker.The layoffs are expected to impact thousands of employees across Intel’s global operations, as the company seeks to streamline its business and reduce costs. Intel has been grappling with declining revenues and increased competition from rivals like AMD and Nvidia, as well as challenges in maintaining its leadership in chip manufacturing . This layoff follows last year’s cut of 15,000 jobs, bringing Intel’s workforce to 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, down from 124,800 the previous year.Under Tan’s leadership, Intel is reportedly prioritising its core business areas, including advanced chip design and manufacturing, while scaling back on less profitable ventures. The restructuring is seen as a critical step in positioning the company for long-term growth in a highly competitive market. During his first public appearance as CEO at the Intel Vision conference, Tan acknowledged the immense challenges facing the company but expressed confidence in a long-term recovery plan. “It won’t happen overnight,” he admitted, “but I know we can get there.”Intel’s struggles are deeply rooted in its delayed response to market shifts, particularly the booming AI sector. While Nvidia has surged ahead to become the world’s most valuable semiconductor company, Intel has lagged behind, missing out on lucrative opportunities in AI and advanced chip manufacturing.Additionally, Intel has paused key expansion projects, including its highly publicised Ohio facility, once touted as the world’s largest chip production hub. Intel is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on Thursday, which may provide further insights into Tan’s restructuring plans.",The layoffs are expected to impact thousands of employees across Intel’s global operations.

"For credible Uniform Civil Code, Hindu law must first be reformed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/for-credible-uniform-civil-code-hindu-law-must-first-be-reformed/articleshow/120569376.cms,"Illustration: Shinod Akkaraparambil

The renewed push for a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), with Uttarakhand becoming the first state to enact one, is being projected as a step toward national unity through secularism. But this framing — where opposition to the current UCC draft is cast as opposition to secularism — masks a more fundamental issue: that a just civil code must be rooted not in uniformity for its own sake, but in the dismantling of inequities embedded within existing personal laws, especially those governing the majority.Reasonable apprehension that the Uttarakhand UCC will serve as a national blueprint arises not only from its substance, but from the absence of reform within the Hindu legal framework, which continues to uphold archaic structures of inheritance, guardianship and divorce.A credible UCC must begin by reforming the majority’s personal laws — not to single them out, but because the onus of equality lies most heavily where the law has remained unreformed. While minority communities have borne and embraced legislative transformations, Hindu law has retained several inequitable structures under the guise of tradition.Muslims, for instance, have seen the abolition of triple talaq as a dramatic departure from centuries of practice. The courts have consistently ensured that Muslim women are entitled to maintenance under Section 125 CrPC, as reaffirmed in ‘Daniel Latifi vs Union of India’ (2001), striking a balance between religious tenets and constitutional morality.Similarly, the constitutional invalidation of Section 118 of the Indian Succession Act has removed unjust restrictions on the right of Christians to make charitable bequests. These are not small revisions. They reflect structural shifts, which minority communities have accepted with dignity and maturity. There is reason to believe that future reforms such as outlawing polygamy or ensuring parity in inheritance for Muslim women will also be met with thoughtful engagement, not rejection. Against this backdrop, Hindu personal law must be the first subject of meaningful reform, not the last.The coparcenary (joint heirship) system under the Mitakshara school of Hindu law continues to grant property rights by birth, a feudal holdover incompatible with modern ideas of merit, consent and equity. Kerala abolished the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) system nearly half a century ago, recognising that it entrenches patriarchy and complicates property rights. Yet the HUF persists in the rest of India, largely due to fiscal incentives, not cultural adherence.Income tax law permits them to function as separate entities, encouraging a proliferation of minor and major HUFs — legal fiction used to shield income and wealth under different names within the same family. This subverts the principle of tax equity and entrenches patriarchal property structures under the guise of legal privilege.Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act discriminates against women by prioritising the husband’s heirs over her natal family. If a Hindu woman dies intestate, her self-acquired property often bypasses her own parents or siblings. A just UCC must amend this, ensuring equal inheritance lines for men and women, both marital and natal. In fact, Muslim personal law already provides a more egalitarian model in several respects: it recognises parents as heirs, places restrictions on testamentary freedom, and provides clear shares for women, even if not yet fully equal. These features offer a rich legal vocabulary for building a fairer code.Despite the Supreme Court’s progressive interpretation in ‘Gita Hariharan vs RBI’ (1999), the law still assumes paternal primacy in guardianship. Any serious UCC must codify the principle that both parents are equal guardians, and custody decisions must be guided solely by the child’s welfare, not the parent’s gender.Hindu law still clings to fault-based divorce, turning dissolution into an adversarial process. A reformed code must adopt no-fault divorce, recognising the irretrievable breakdown of marriage and affirming mutual consent as the cornerstone of modern separation.Equally important is the issue of matrimonial property. Today, assets acquired during marriage remain solely in the name of the individual who earned or acquired them — usually the husband — leaving the other partner economically vulnerable. A just civil code must establish the principle of community property, treating all income and assets earned during marriage as joint property. This recognises marriage as a partnership, economic as well as emotional.Maintenance law remains unpredictable and inconsistent. A UCC must codify a clear, reasonable formula: between one-third to onehalf of the earning spouse’s income, calibrated to the dependent spouse’s own financial capacity. Such clarity would bring stability, predictability and dignity to those navigating separation.The beauty of India’s legal diversity is that progressive norms exist across communities, often in unexpected places. The Muslim prohibition on unfettered testamentary freedom, the Goa Civil Code’s recognition of legitimacy for children born outside marriage, and the Islamic approach to divorce without blame all offer important models for reform. But this borrowing must be seamless, not spotlighted. The goal is not to parade one community’s practices as more enlightened, but to build a cohesive legal architecture rooted in justice, compassion, and constitutional values.The risk of the UCC becoming a majoritarian civil code in secular clothing is real. If the Uttarakhand model is replicated nationally without critical introspection, it may perpetuate the very inequalities it claims to abolish.Uniformity, when built upon unequal foundations, becomes a tool of consolidation, not liberation. The real test of the UCC lies not in whether it is “secular” in label, but whether it is equitable in effect. That journey must begin with dismantling the injustices internal to Hindu personal law, from HUFs and property by birth, to discriminatory inheritance rules, guardianship norms, and opaque maintenance provisions. If the majority community resists such introspection, then the call for a uniform code risks being seen not as a pursuit of equality, but a mechanism of assimilation.The time has come not just to speak of uniformity, but to start with justice, especially within one’s own house.(The writer was formerly a judge of Punjab & Haryana high court)","The push for a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), with Uttarakhand becoming the first state to enact one, is being projected as a step toward national unity through secularism.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Navigating trade tightrope: US juggles tariff politics and global market trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/navigating-trade-tightrope-us-juggles-tariff-politics-and-global-market-trust/articleshow/120567078.cms,".

A growing split in US economic messaging is evident, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ’s call for international cooperation collided with president Trump ’s renewed threats of trade tariffs and a hardline message from the White House press room.Speaking at the Institute of International Finance, Bessent reassured investors that the US remained committed to its global leadership role, even while levelling sharp criticism at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for drifting from their core mandates. “America first does not mean America alone,” Bessent said. “It is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners.”But any attempt at tempering international unease was quickly overshadowed by a firm statement from the White House. US press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox Newon Wednesday that “there will be no unilateral reduction in tariffs against China,” effectively closing the door on speculation sparked by president Trump himself.Trump had floated the idea that the administration's sweeping 145% tariffs on Chinese goods could “come down substantially,” raising hopes of a thaw in trade tensions. But Leavitt made clear that tariffs will remain in place unless Beijing agrees to a new deal. “The president has made it clear China needs to make a significant deal with the United States of America,” she said. “And we are optimistic that will happen.”Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, has been attempting to walk a delicate line between Trump’s protectionist instincts and the need for global financial stability. While not backing a full withdrawal from the IMF or World Bank—a policy floated in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—he criticised both institutions for “mission creep” and prioritising issues like climate change and gender equality over economic fundamentals.Even as he called for reform, Bessent ’s tone marked a departure from the more radical elements of Trump’s economic policy. He acknowledged the importance of multilateral institutions in fostering stability and hinted at the possibility of a recalibrated relationship with China. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here,” he said, suggesting mutual economic rebalancing—more US manufacturing and increased Chinese consumption.The confusion surrounding trade policy reflects a broader challenge within the administration: reconciling nationalist economic policies with a desire to project financial leadership abroad. For development bankers and global markets, Bessent’s speech may have brought some relief—but Leavitt’s blunt message was a reminder that the White House remains committed to a confrontational approach.",Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been attempting to walk a delicate line between Trump’s protectionist instincts and the need for global financial stability.

"Donald Trump cracks down on colleges, equity programs in new executive orders: What it means",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-cracks-down-on-colleges-equity-programs-in-new-executive-orders-what-it-means/articleshow/120567198.cms,"US President Donald Trump in a new executive order signed Wednesday (local time) targeted the college accreditation process , a key mechanism through which universities gain access to federal financial aid, intensifying his administration's ongoing conflict with elite academic institutions such as Harvard University, The Hill reported.The order, which has not yet been publicly released, was described by the Wall Street Journal as an effort to curb what Trump considers “ideological overreach” in higher education and to promote “intellectual diversity” on campus.The executive directive seeks to make it easier for institutions to switch accreditors, thus encouraging competition in an accreditor space that has long been criticized for its rigid bureaucracy and limited accountability.“University accreditation is currently a process controlled by a number of third-party organisations that are, by statute, by law. Many of those third-party accreditors have relied on a sort of woke ideology to accredit universities instead of accrediting based on merit and performance,” said White House staff secretary Will Scharf.The directive authorises the Secretary of Education to hold accreditors accountable, including potential denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination for poor performance or violations of the Civil Rights Act, CNN reported. It also empowers the Attorney General and Education Secretary to investigate and terminate instances of unlawful discrimination in higher education institutions, including law and medical schools.The order is part of a broader reshaping of higher education governance by Trump’s Domestic Policy Council, led by figures such as deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. It follows a $2.2 billion funding freeze targeting Harvard, announced just a week earlier, underscoring a deepening standoff between Trump’s administration and elite academic institutions over issues of academic freedom, oversight, and alleged political bias.Further executive actions announced Wednesday include mandates to train students in artificial intelligence, enforce laws on foreign gifts to universities, and launch a White House initiative on historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). “That’s a big deal,” Trump said of the AI training push. “We have literally trillions of dollars being invested in AI.”The political backdrop to the order is fraught. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to revoke Harvard’s certification to enrol international students unless the university complies with demands to provide records on “illegal and violent activities” involving foreign students. According to the DHS, Harvard must submit the records by April 30, 2025, or face immediate consequences.Harvard, which has nearly 6,800 international students — roughly 27.2% of its total enrollment for 2024–25 — said in response that it “will not surrender their independence or relinquish their constitutional rights.”This intensifying federal scrutiny of accreditation also follows similar grievances aired by Republican figures like Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who last year sued the Biden administration, declaring he would not “bow to unaccountable accreditors who think they should run Florida's public universities.”The move has sparked anxiety within academic circles, as a revocation of accreditation could deprive universities of federal student loans and Pell grants — critical funding lifelines for both institutions and students alike.","US President Donald Trump in a new executive order signed Wednesday (local time) targeted the college accreditation process.
