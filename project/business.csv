"NGO Report: 'Over 4400 child marriages take place everyday but cases registered during the last five years stand at a mere 3,863'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ngo-report-over-4400-child-marriages-take-place-everyday-but-cases-registered-during-the-last-five-years-stand-at-a-mere-3863/articleshow/111822638.cms,"NEW DELHI: Drawing attention to the gravity of the problem and the need for strong legal interventions , a new study highlights that every minute, 3 girls get married in India, and yet in 2022, only 3 cases were registered every day.On an average, only one case of child marriage per district was registered for prosecution in 2022, shows an analysis of govt data, by 'India Child Protection’ research team which is part of 'Child Marriage Free India' (CMFI) network of civil society organisations.The report draws its analysis from Census 2011, National Crime Records Bureau and National family Health Survey 5 (2019-21).Calling for legal action to end child marriage, the report highlights Assam as a case study that the country can learn from. The analysis cites 81% reduction in the instances of child marriage across 1,132 villages 20 districts of Assam between 2021-22 and 2023-24. In absolute numbers, the incidence of child marriages has declined from 3,225 cases in 2021–22 to 627 cases in 2023–24. The survey was carried out in these villages in the backdrop of the Assam govt's crackdown on child marriages last year which resulted in over 3000 arrests. The report claims that 98% percent of the respondents believed that the Assam government’s strict law enforcement initiatives in 2023 had a substantial and striking influence on the reduction of child marriages within their communities.On the national front, the report shows that the total number of child marriage cases as per National Crime Records Bureau registered during the last five years from 2018-2022 was only 3,863. On the other hand the 2011 census of India estimates suggest that approximately 16,21,257 child marriages are taking place every year in the country, which roughly translates to 4,442 marriages every day. Even the latest round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) estimates shows that 23.3% of women aged 20–24 were married before the age of 18 years.Prolonged trials in courts and poor conviction rate are cited as key concerns. “In 2022, out of the total 3,563 child marriage cases listed for trial in courts under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, a mere 181 cases were successfully concluded in terms of trial completion,” it is stated. Infact, this slow disposal rate has resulted in a persistently high pendency rate, which stands at 92%. Moreover, despite the fact that there are only 3,365 cases pending, with the current rate of disposal, the country may take 19 years to clear the backlogs as of 2022.As far as the conviction rate in cases filed under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act goes, in 2022, a mere 11%of these cases resulted in convictions, contrasting sharply with the overall conviction rate of 34% for all crimes committed against children during that year.The report also highlights that civil society organisations associated with CMFI successfully prevented 14,137 child marriages in 2023-24 by using legal interventions and prevented 59,364 child marriages with the help of panchayats. A sample of 2436 child marriage succefully stopped by NGOs shows that in 42% of the cases the boys were also a victim of child marriage and in 58% cases the boy was over 21 years of age. In almost two thirds of cases the victims were going to be married to boys above 21 years, where the age difference was over 3 years. In 12 percent cases the same was over 7 years with the groom being over 25 years and above.“This clearly establishes that majority cases of child marriages are instances of exploiting the vulnerability of the girl child with older men taking advantage of their position of authority and the vulnerability of these girls,” it is highlighted.","In 2022, only one case of child marriage per district was registered for prosecution in India. In absolute numbers, the incidence of child marriages has declined from 3,225 cases in 2021–22 to 627 cases in 2023–24.

3 girls are forced into child marriage per minute in India: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-girls-are-forced-into-child-marriage-per-minute-in-india-study/articleshow/111821799.cms,"NEW DELHI:

With 81% drop in 3 years,

a case study in curbing child marriage: Study

Times View In India, child marriage was first banned back in 1929. The Act has been improved upon on several occasions. However, as this data shows, the regressive practice is alive and kicking. This is a national disgrace and cause for serious concern. Ending child marriage can also help improve maternal and infant mortality rates, female labour force participation and gender equality. The 2021 bill, which sought to amend the prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, should be taken up afresh. But the truth is that no regressive practice survives without social sanction. That’s why authorities as well as NGOs should act in mission mode

We are 24 years into the 21st century, but every minute, three girl children are forced into marriage in India. Not that you will know this from crime data, which captures a fraction of child marriages in the country. Take 2022, for example. Only three cases were registered per day nationwide. It gets grimmer: in most cases, the groom was over 21.These shocking numbers are courtesy a new study by 'India Child Protection' research team, part of the ' Child Marriage Free India' network of civil society organisations.The report analysed data from Census 2011, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21).Per the report, NCRB data for 2018-2022 records 3,863 child marriages. But, as the study points out, extrapolating from Census estimates, 16 lakh child marriages take place every year.That translates into over 4,000 child marriages every day. NFHS-5 estimates show that 23.3% of women in the 20-24 age bracket were married before they were 18.Assam is cited as a case study in curbing child marriage. The report says, between 2021-22 and 2023-24, there was an 81% drop in child marriages across 1,132 villages in 20 districts of the state. In absolute numbers, the decline is from 3,225 cases in 2021-22 to 627 in 2023-24. Last year, there were over 3,000 arrests for this crime.In a survey carried out in these villages, 98% of respondents believed that the state's strict law enforcement is a major reason child marriages are declining in number.The picture is different everywhere else. The report says prolonged trials in courts and poor conviction rates encourage those intent on marrying off girl children. ""In 2022, out of the total 3,563 child marriage cases listed for trial in courts under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, a mere 181 cases were successfully concluded in terms of trial completion,"" the report said. Case pendency rate is 92%. Conviction rate is 11%.Analysing data of child marriages that were prevented by various NGOs, the report says, a ""majority of cases of child marriages are instances of exploiting the vulnerability of the girl child, with older men taking advantage of their position of authority and the vulnerability of these girls"".","In 2022, out of the total 3,563 child marriage cases listed for trial in courts under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, a mere 181 cases were successfully concluded.

Telangana CM Revanth Reddy lists out big-ticket projects to transform old RR district,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telangana-cm-revanth-reddy-lists-out-big-ticket-projects-to-transform-old-rr-district/articleshow/111743889.cms,"Revanth Reddy

HYDERABAD: Chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Sunday unveiled his vision to develop the erstwhile Rangareddy (RR) district with a slew of ambitious projects to transform the landscape.Among the plans on the anvil are developing scenic Rachakonda as a hub for the film industry, a new city of international standards in Maheshwaram, and sports universities, medical and health hub, and electric vehicle manufacturing unit in the land earlier acquired for pharma city in the area.The erstwhile Rangareddy district once extended up to Medak in north, Mahabubnagar in south, Nalgonda in east, and bordered Karnataka's Gulbarga in west and Bidar in north west. However, in the districts reorganisation by the previous BRS govt, Rangareddy was split into three districts of Vikarabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Rangareddy.The CM, who was speaking at the launch of safety kits for toddy tappers in the district, advised them to encourage their children to go for higher studies to become lawmakers, IAS and IPS officers , and help in the development of Telangana.""You should educate your children. Education is the only weapon for weaker sections to become rulers. The state govt will extend full support to toddy tappers and the Goud community in their traditional occupations, but educating children is more important,"" the CM said.Elaborating on his plans, the CM said that metro rail will be extended up to Hayathnagar and other parts in the district.""The state govt will take the responsibility of building a magnificent city at Maheshwaram to compete with New York.

"Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Are you paying excess tax? You may be paying Rs 43,226 extra on Rs 10 lakh income",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-income-tax-expectations-are-you-paying-excess-tax-you-may-be-paying-rs-43226-extra-on-rs-10-lakh-income-find-out-why/articleshow/111800608.cms,"Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Are you paying excess tax?

Let's examine the tax liability for a taxable income of Rs 10 lakh.

The old regime results in a tax liability of Rs 1.17 lakh, which translates to an effective tax rate of 11.7%. In contrast, under the new tax regime, the tax liability stands at Rs 62,400, or 6.24%, says Bankbazaar.

Adjusting the 2013-14 tax (Rs 1.33 lakh) for inflation, the tax should have been reduced to Rs 73,774, or 7.3%.

Taking inflation into account, Rs 10 lakh in 2013 is equivalent to Rs 5.5 lakh in 2024. Consequently, the 'real' tax rate under the old regime is 21%, while it is 11.3% under the new regime.

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Budget 2024 should look to change tax slabs under the old tax regime and also consider changes to the new tax regime to inflation-adjust the tax burden borne by salaried taxpayers , says Bankbazaar.com in its Pre-Budget 2024 primer.The old tax regime income tax slab rates, which have remained unchanged since 2013, have not been adjusted for inflation, resulting in taxpayers paying higher tax rates despite the rising cost of living, says Bankbazaar.Considering 2012-13 as the reference point, the value of every Rs 1 earned has effectively decreased to Rs 0.55 in 2024-25. Consequently, an income of Rs 10 lakh in 2012-13 now has the purchasing power of only Rs 5.50 lakh, while Rs 20 lakh is now equivalent to Rs 11 lakh in terms of buying capacity, it notes.Also Check | Budget 2024 Expectations Live Updates: Income tax relief for salaried taxpayers, railways capex in focus To put it simply, an income of Rs 10 lakh in 2012-13 would need to be Rs 18.15 lakh today, and an income of Rs 20 lakh would need to be Rs 36.30 lakh to have the same buying power.Bankbazaar’s analysis says that when inflation-adjustment is not taken into account for income tax brackets, and considering the 2012-13 inflation figures as the starting point, it leads to the inference that taxpayers are shelling out more than what they should.Under the old tax regime, earnings exceeding Rs 5 lakh are being subjected to excess taxes. In the new tax regime, this threshold is set at Rs 15 lakh, it says.For instance, on an income of Rs 10 lakh, excess taxes paid in the old regime are Rs 43,226, or Rs 3602 per month. At Rs 20 lakh, excess taxes paid are Rs 1.84 lakh in the old regime and Rs 67,978 in the new regime.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 5 things FM Sitharaman should do for taxpayers - from tax slab changes to hiking standard deduction The new regime appears to be more favorable in terms of inflation adjustment. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the positive impact of the new tax regime is limited to incomes up to Rs 15 lakh. Within this income range, the effective tax rates seem to be lower compared to the inflation-adjusted values from 2013-14.For incomes exceeding Rs 15 lakh, the new regime does not provide any inflation adjustment. In comparison, the old regime fails to offer inflation adjustment for any income above Rs 5 lakh, it says.","Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: Budget 2024 should look to change tax slabs under the old tax regime, says Bankbazaar.

Karnataka Reservation Bill: Karnataka government puts job reservation bill on hold amid massive backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-holds-job-reservation-bill-amid-massive-backlash/articleshow/111814898.cms,"Karnataka job quota

: What is the contentious bill?

Andhra Pradesh versus Karnataka over quota

The Karnakata government has decided to put the controversial job reservation bill on hold for the time being facing massive pushback from industries. Chief minister Siddaramaiah said the bill will be revisited and the future course of action will be decided in the coming days. ""The bill approved by the cabinet to provide reservation for Kannadigas in private sector organizations, industries and enterprises has been temporarily put on hold,"" the chief minister issued a statement on X.The Karnataka State Employment of Local Candidates in the Industries, Factories and Other Establishments Bill, 2024 was passed in the Cabinet meeting on Monday.It said any industry, factory or other establishments shall appoint 50 per cent of local candidates in management categories and 70 per cent in non-management categories.If the candidates do not have secondary school certificates with Kannada as a language, they would have to pass a Kannada proficiency test, the bill stipulated.The Kannada-must provision drew flak from industry leaders as they argued that Bengaluru will lose skilled talent if such a bill is adopted. Another genius move from Govt of Karnataka. ""Mandate LOCAL RESERVATION & APPOINT GOVT OFFICER IN EVERY COMPANY to monitor. This will scare Indian IT & GCCs. Short sighted,"" Assocham co-chairman RK Mishra said.Karnataka's move is similar to a bill introduced by the Haryana government, mandating 75 per cent reservation in private sector jobs to residents of the state. It was, however, struck down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on November 17, 2023.A bill enforcing 50 per cent reservation for administrative posts and 75 per cent for non-administrative posts for Kannadigas in private industries is the bone of contention.Initially, the government was defensive about the move of prioritizing the Kannadigas as Siddaramaiah said the government does not want the Kannadigas to be deprived of job opportunities in the state. ""We are a pro-Kannada government. Our priority is to look after the welfare of the Kannadigas,"" Siddaramaiah said.With the industries expressing concerns that they may have to shut shops in Karnataka if Kannada becomes a qualifier for jobs, Andhra Pradesh minister Nara Lokesh did not miss the opportunity to try to lure away the industry honchos.""We understand your disappointment. We welcome you to expand or relocate your businesses to our IT, IT services, AI and data center cluster at Vizag. We will offer you best-in-class facilities, uninterrupted power, infrastructure and the most suitable skilled talent for your IT enterprise with no restrictions from the Government. Andhra Pradesh is ready to welcome you. Please get in touch!"" Nara Lokesh posted.Karnataka minister Priyanka Kharge replied to Lokesh and asked whether the minister does not want Andhra Pradesh companies to employ Andhra people.""Karnataka has always excelled in the most sector due to our consistent relationships and consultative approach with industry leaders, advisory bodies, and consortiums in drafting policies and schemes. As with previous initiatives, this draft bill will include recommendations from our industry partners,"" Kharge wrote.""Our goal is to develop a global workforce using local talent, while also encouraging global investments and creating employment opportunities.""""By the way, wouldn’t you also like to ensure that every company invested in Andhra Pradesh employs deserving, trained and skilled individuals from Andhra Pradesh?

Haryana govt faced similar blow

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka government's quota bill to facilitate reservation for locals in private jobs has been put on hold after massive uproar.The decision by the Siddaramaiah government came after stakeholders expressed disappointment and multiple concerns over the outcome which would pan out following the bill's implementation.Karnataka State Employment of Local Industries Factories Establishment Act Bill, formulated to cap employment for non-locals in private companies in the state, proposes to reserve 50 per cent of jobs in managerial roles and 70 per cent in non-managerial jobs for local candidates .The quota shall be applied to all industries, factories, and other establishments in the state.It also stipulates that candidates not possessing a secondary school certificate with Kannada as a language will need to pass a Kannada proficiency test .The bill, which has now been put on hold, will not be immune to challenges even if the Karnataka assembly passes it with ease down the line.Taking a cue from Haryana and Bihar 's similar push in the past, Karnataka's quota bill might not pass the muster of law -- as happened with the two northern states.Last month Patna high court struck down a 65 per cent reservation cap set by the state in government jobs and educational institutions.The court pronounced the judgement after hearing petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the increase in quota for backward, extremely backward classes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes from 50 per cent to 65 per cent in government jobs and higher educational institutions in the state.The petitioners had challenged the constitutional validity of the amendments made in reservation laws. On November 21, the state government had notified the amended reservation laws.The Bihar government in November last year had officially notified in the state gazette two bills, aiming to raise the quota for deprived castes from 50 per cent to 65 per cent in government jobs and educational institutions. With the enactments, Bihar held the highest reservation percentage among larger states, reaching a total of 75 per cent.According to the gazette notification, the revised reservation percentages included 20 per cent for scheduled castes, 2 per cent for scheduled tribes, 18 per cent for backward classes, 25 per cent for extremely backward classes, and the EWS has 10 per cent quota in the state.The amendments represented an increase in the quota for scheduled castes from 16 per cent to 20 per cent, scheduled tribes from 1 per cent to 2 per cent, extremely backward classes from 18 per cent to 25 per cent, and backward classes from 15 per cent to 18 per cent.The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, providing 75 per cent reservation in Haryana industries for the domiciles of the state was passed by the state legislative assembly on March 2, 2021.On November 6, 2021, a notification was also issued by the state's labour department regarding its applicability.However, last year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had set aside the law.The division bench comprising Justice G S Sandhawalia and Justice Harpreet Kaur Jeewan of the HC passed these orders after hearing several petitions filed by various Industrial bodies of Haryana.The main grievance of the industrial bodies was that by introducing policy of ""Son of Soils"", the Haryana government wants to create reservation in private sector which is infringement of the constitutional rights of the employers because private sector jobs are purely based on the skills and analytical blend of mind of the employees who are citizen of India having constitutional rights on the basis of their education to do jobs in any part of India.",The Karnataka government's quota bill to facilitate reservation for locals in private jobs has been put on hold. The decision by the Siddaramaiah government came after stakeholders expressed disappointment and multiple concerns over the outcome. Last month Patna high court struck down a 65 per cent reservation cap set by the state in government jobs and educational institutions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111814584,imgsize-162898,width-400,resizemode-4/111814584.jpg"

Still mourning his death, we were shocked to hear Anil being held responsible even before the inquiry had begun.But we are glad that Railways has conducted a proper inquiry and cleared him. His soul can now rest in peace,"" Anil's widow, Roshni Kumar, told TOI .Within two hours of the goods train rear-ending the Kanchanjunga Express, Railway Board chairperson Jaya Verma Sinha and other railway officials jumped to the conclusion that the ""deceased pilot"" and his injured assistant were at fault.The CCRS preliminary report held that the freight train loco pilot was allowed on a section despite the presence of Kanchanjunga Express and was handed a wrong memo to pass all defective signals without any caution order.The investigation found that the goods train was travelling at 78 kmph when it spotted the rear end of Kanchenjungha Express and applied the emergency brake. But the train could slow down to only 40 kmph before it crashing into Kanchenjungha. The report noted that Anil had adjusted the throttle 10 times in 5 minutes, indicating his alertnesss.Neighbours said they always believed that Kumar couldn't have been at fault, given his stainless career and reputation for sincerity. ""It was unfair to blame a dead man for the accident, especially since he was unable to defend himself. We are relieved that that the truth has come out,"" said Kajal Das, a neighbour.Railway officials said Kumar's family was paid a compensation of Rs 25 lakh. ""The pension order has also been issued and the gratuity will be paid soon.

LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: ""Jab hum ye maan ke chalte hain ati atma-vishwas mein ki hum to jeet hi rahe hain to swabhavik roop se humen khamiyaja bhi bhugatna padta hai. Jo vipaksh chunav ke pehle himmat haar ke baith gaya tha wo aaj phir se uchhal kood karne ka karya kar raha hai ( BJP paid the price for its over-confidence. Our opponents, who were despondent before the polls, now have a spring in their step),"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said at a meeting of the state executive in Lucknow on Sunday, which saw him lamenting the failure to check ""fake narratives"" - a reference to opposition's allegation about the plot to finish quotas.His audience included BJP president J P Nadda.""Hamare yahan sangathan sadaiv sarkar se bada raha hai. Sabhi mantriyon, vidhayakon aur jan pratinidhiyon ko karyakartaon ka samman karna chahiye. Main pehle ek karyakarta hoon aur uske baad up-mukhyamantri (In BJP's scheme, the organisation always takes precedence over govt and it is, therefore, incumbent upon all ministers, MLAs and public representatives to respect workers and take care of their dignity. I am a party worker first and deputy CM second,"" Keshav Maurya said at the same venue.Few of the lakhs of BJP workers in the politically key state, trying to come to grips with the unexpected reverses in LS polls, would have found the statements to be problematic.However, if none of them is amused, it is because of the not-so-subtle message driven home and the backdrop of the feud that the party's underwhelming performance has sparked.In the current tense times, Yogi's message, although factually correct, has been seen as aimed at the state unit and sullen colleagues like Maurya who have sought to pin the unexpected losses on the CM. He made it clear that he had no intention to be reduced from the poster boy of modern Hinduva to the whipping boy.Ditto for Maurya. His concern for the respect of workers has been seen as echoing the complaint of the anti-Yogi faction about the organisation being reduced to an adjunct of the govt.The utterances have brought to fore the simmering differences between the CM and an influential set who have chafed at his popularity and dominance.Right since the 2017 landslide, scripted by Union home minister Amit Shah, then the BJP chief, which brought the party to office, Yogi loomed large over the organisation by the sheer force of his appeal. Maurya, state party chief at the time of assembly elections who saw himself as the natural claimant for the spoils, always found it difficult to reconcile himself to being the second fiddle but had to acquiesce to his existence as a junior partner.Although the second term saw restraints being placed on Yogi's powers to placate wounded aspirations, in the public imagination Yogi still dwarfed everyone else. The appearance of govt-organisation tandem also somehow held until the disappointment on June 4 exposed the cracks and set the stage for an open season of blame game where an assortment of considerations - from course correction on caste in view of SP's gains among non-Yadav OBCs and Dalits to the need for better chemistry with cadre and levelling the playing field among state functionaries - have been bandied about.Nadda had a first-hand experience of the rumblings in the state which was crucial for BJP's back-to-back victories in 2014 and 2019. He has since thought it fit to hold deliberations with Maurya and state chief Bhupendra Chaudhary, a nondescript figure who has lately acquired a profile by framing himself as the voice of the ""party worker"".Significantly, Chaudhary's meeting with PM Modi on Wednesday sparked speculation that he has been asked to step down, something which he rushed to deny.Maurya taking up cudgels for the cadre has been seen by some as a joust for the important portfolio of public works department which he held in the first term. Maurya was shifted to rural development in the second term with PWD going to Jitendra Prasada who has since been elected to LS and appointed a minister. The department has since been lying vacant.But others say Maurya, an OBC, has his sights higher and that by positioning himself as an ""organisation man"" he could, in fact, be trying to be the party chief, the argument being that the party needs to bring the non-Yadav OBCs back.Senior members acknowledged that comments from several functionaries in the state have dented its image of a disciplined party but added that it was expected as they needed to vent their feelings after suffering a defeat few saw coming.""In a way, it is good the pent-up steam has been blown,"" said a senior BJP source, adding that the top priority now would be to do well in the assembly bypolls to 10 seats. The Election Commission is likely to announce the date soon.Sources said the meetings could be the beginning of the much-expected exercise to rearrange the organisational chess board in the state in a bid to boost the morale of workers and put the house in order. This could be the first sitting of central representatives to take feedback of the UP brass with regards to the party's poor performance in the LS polls. Sources said more meetings of UP BJP members, including Yogi meeting the central brass, are expected soon.","Yogi Adityanath: ""BJP paid the price for its over-confidence.

: Just because SC carved out an exception, law being misued

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said that it is wasting a lot of judicial time these days as people convicted in serious offences are filing frivolous petitions long after dismissal of their appeals claiming to be juveniles at the time of committing the offence.Twin factors have given wing to such pleas - an SC ruling of 2012 that a convict can at any time, even after dismissal of appeal by SC, raise the plea of juvenility for the first time; and Juvenile Justice Act, which bars incarceration beyond three years.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices PS Narasimha and J B Pardiwala on Tuesday was confronted with a plea of juvenility filed by a convict more than a year after SC dismissed his appeal against conviction. The trial court had convicted him for a 1997 murder in 1999 and Madhya Pradesh high court had upheld his conviction in 2017.He had never whispered a plea about being a juvenile during the past 27 years, when the case against him rolled from trial court to the apex court. His plea for juvenility was scrutinised by SC because of its Oct 10, 2012 judgment in Abuzar Hossain case, where it ruled that ""claim of juvenility... may be raised for the first time before SC as well after final disposal... The delay... cannot be a ground for rejection of such a claim.""The CJI-led bench on Tuesday said, ""Now that a plea of juvenility can be raised at any stage... Most of them are completely bogus and a waste of the court's time.""The murder convict, serving life term, had submitted a bogus birth certificate and a sarpanch's panchnama as a supporting document. SC had ordered an inquiry and the district authorities concerned reported back that there was no evidence to substantiate his juvenile claim .After dismissing the plea, CJI Chandrachud said, ""Just because an exception was carved out by the SC judgment, this is how the law is being misused... The convicts must be careful in filing such applications in future.""Section 9(2) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 contemplated that whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court, the court shall make an inquiry and take such evidence as may be necessary.",Supreme Court has said that it is wasting a lot of judicial time these days.

SC warns against coercive action on NCR homebuyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-warns-against-coercive-action-on-ncr-homebuyers/articleshow/111821724.cms,"'Banks disbursed loan to builder but didn't link it to

construction stages

'

NEW DELHI: In a relief to many homebuyers who booked flats under the subvention plan and have not received possession of their flats in various projects across the NCR due to inordinate delays by developers, the Supreme Court has directed that no coercive action be taken against them by banks or builders regarding payment of EMI, and no complaints shall be entertained against them in cheque bounce cases.Under the subvention scheme, banks disburse the sanctioned amount directly to the accounts of builders, who are then to pay EMIs on the sanctioned loan amount until possession of the flats is handed over to the homebuyers. As builders started defaulting in paying the EMIs to the banks as per the tripartite agreement, banks initiated action against the buyers to recover the amount.Aggrieved by the action of banks, a large number of homebuyers had approached Delhi high court, which had in 2023 refused to grant them relief saying, there were alternate remedies available to them. Subsequently, they knocked the doors of the apex court, which granted them interim protection.As homebuyers are facing the threat of cheque bounce cases, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan on Monday directed that no cheque bounce complaint against such homebuyers be entertained while the issue is pending.""In the meantime, there shall be interim stay in all matters, to the effect that no coercive action including complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, shall be entertained on behalf of the banks/financial institutions or builders/developers against the homebuyers,"" the order, granting protection to all such homebuyers.Challenging the HC order, the aggrieved homebuyers submitted that they were victims of illegal disbursal of loan by the bank directly into the account of the builder in violation of RBI guidelines .""This is the classic case where one rich man (bank/financial institutions) gave money to another rich man (builder). The rich man who received the money (builder) ran away with it without fulfilling his obligations. The rich man who gave the money (bank/financial institutions), disbursed it in violation of the law of the land. The poor man (homebuyer) is now made a victim and is pushed into litigation by the bank when he has not received a single rupee. And is deprived of his dream home,"" a petition, filed by advocate Anshul Gupta on behalf of a batch of homebuyers, said.They alleged that the main violation was that the banks disbursed the loan amounts directly to the builder without linking it to the stages of construction, in gross violation of RBI circulars as well as National Housing Bank (NHB) guidelines.""The high court failed to take note of the fact that the builder as well as bank both acted hand in glove. The poor homebuyer is used as a medium to get the loan sanctioned and money transferred from the bank to the builder. The homebuyer herein is pushed into the litigation for the amount which he himself has never seen or actually received. The acts of both builder and banks are in violation of tri-partite agreement and also in violation of RBI/NHB statutory guidelines,"" the petition said.""The homebuyers are taken for a ride and there exists no legal framework to address the issues when the insolvency proceedings are initiated against the real estate developer and banks still keep charging EMIs/pre-EMIs even when the liability of repayment is of the real estate builder,"" it said.Agreeing to examine the grievances of homebuyers, SC directed builders/developers two weeks' time to file reply affidavit including details of their assets and the court made it clear that it would be constrained to take coercive action against them if they failed to comply with its order.","Banks disbursed loan to builder but didn't link it to stages of construction, petition says.

Who are zero-dose children and why it doesn't mean no shots given,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-are-zero-dose-children-and-why-it-doesnt-mean-no-shots-given/articleshow/111821296.cms,"WHO defines zero-dose children as those who lack access to or are never reached by routine immunisation services. They are operationally measured as those who did not receive their first dose of the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) vaccine. It is mainly used to communicate about immunisation gaps and to push for concerted efforts to bridge them.It is calculated as the difference between estimated surviving infants and the estimated number of children who received the first dose of DPT.Not necessarily. Since zero dose means those babies who did not receive the first dose of DPT - which in India is given at six weeks - it's possible that most zero-dose children have got most or all vaccines that are given at birth. The latest National Family Health Survey (2019-21) indicates that 88.6% births are institutional or those happening in a health facility. However, the proportion of children less than two years of age who received the birth dose of the BCG vaccine against TB is 95%. This indicates that even children who were not born at a health facility were accessing immunisation services . According to the latest UN estimate, there were 1.6 million zero-dose children in India in 2023, up from 1.1 million in 2022. With an estimated 23 million births every year, it would mean that 6.9% of surviving infants in 2023 were zero-dose children.Vaccines given at or soon after birth include BCG (given at birth or as early as possible till one year of age), Hepatitis B vaccine (given at birth or as early as possible within 24 hours), and oral polio vaccine (OPV; at birth or as early as possible within the first 15 days). At six weeks, the baby gets a single dose fractional inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), another dose of OPV (oral rotavirus vaccine), first of two doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and first of three doses of pentavalent vaccine, which is a combination of diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines. Hence, if a baby has missed the first dose of DPT, it is assumed that they have likely missed all the others to be given at six weeks. In WHO/UN estimates, not receiving the first dose of DPT-containing vaccine is understood to signal a lack of access to routine immunisation as a whole, which might not be the case.A study supported by the Gates Foundation published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in Feb 2023 looked at zero-dose immunisation over 29 years (from 1993 to 2021; see chart) using anonymised data from all five rounds of India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS). It found that the proportion of zero-dose babies decreased from an overall 33.4% to 6.6% between 1993 and 2021.In absolute numbers, there was a huge fall in the number of zero-dose children in 10 years from 2006 to 2016. From about 85 lakh zero-dose children in 2006, it fell to just over 16 lakh by 2016. However, the annual relative decrease was highest in the five-year period between 2016 and 2021 at 7.4% per year. This was after the launch in 2014 of Mission Indradhanush, which aimed to cover all unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children. After the setback that the immunisation programme suffered during Covid, when the number of zero-dose children went up to 27 lakh, India managed to bring it down to 11 lakh in 2022 according to Unicef estimates. However, in 2023 that number has gone up to 16 lakh, according to Unicef.","WHO defines zero-dose children as those who lack access to or are never reached by routine immunisation services.

They added several new provisions have been made based on the learnings from the earlier scheme, seeking to eliminate the scope to beat the system.In its first Cabinet meeting, the govt had given a go ahead to the second phase of the scheme to provide financial assistance for three crore houses - two crore in rural and one crore in urban areas - over the next five years, but the cost to be incurred for this has to be approved.Like the last phase, PMAY (U) 2.0 will have four - beneficiary-led construction, in-situ slum rehabilitation and credit linked subsidy scheme (CLSS).

While maintaining neutrality is crucial for Bangladesh’s foreign policy, the Teesta project poses a challenge as it may force Bangladesh to take sides or risk alienating key partners.

“Engaging with India could reinforce bilateral relations and address immediate security concerns, but at the risk of alienating China and potentially missing out on economic opportunities. Conversely, embracing China’s involvement may yield economic benefits but could strain relations with India.”

However, according to an Indian analyst, the China factor should not be overstated.

“India-Bangladesh ties today stand on their own merit. Hasina and Modi have ensured that by focusing on concrete tangible outcomes for the people of both nations, they have redefined the contours of what an ideal partnership between two neighbours should look like. Mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity have made this relationship an exemplar for all others,” writes professor Harsh V Pant, vice-president, Studies and Foreign Policy at Observer Research Foundation.

Back from her China visit, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said something that would be music to India’s ears.She has announced in Dhaka that India, as the next-door neighbour, has the right on the Teesta water conservation and associated special economic zone (SEZ) project and she would prefer New Delhi to implement the same, The Economic Times reports.Both China and India are competing to build the mega project on the cross-border river involving a reservoir. But New Delhi is believed to have reservations over China's potential involvement in the project near its strategic Siliguri Corridor , also known as the Chicken's Neck, which connects the northeastern region with the rest of India.India’s concerns are genuine given the years-long border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh.On June 25, Hasina told reporters in Dhaka that Bangladesh would carefully assess the proposals from both India and China on this project and accept the better one for her country.Hasina, who visited India last month at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had described her trip as “very fruitful” and said the outcome of her talks with India's top leadership would play a “pivotal role” in strengthening the existing bilateral relations and opening new avenues of cooperation.That was her first visit to a neighbouring country since her return to power in January.Asked which side she favoured more as far as India and China were concerned regarding the Teesta project , the 76-year-old leader had said, “We maintain our friendships based on the developmental needs of our country”.“When we receive a proposal, we consider factors such as its suitability for us, our capacity to repay any loans, the returns we will enjoy after project completion, and how it will benefit the people of our country,” she said after her second visit to Delhi in June.However, the Bangladesh PM has now clearly spelled out her preference.“...I would prioritise that India will do it [the Teesta project]. India holds the water of Teesta River.... So, they should do the project and they would give whatever is necessary here if they do the project,"" Hasina said in Dhaka on July 14.She seems to be upset over China remaining non-committal on backing the project during her recent Beijing trip. Hasina cut short her China visit after Beijing backtracked on a financial package of $5 billion and did not offer her adequate protocol.She had expected to hold a lengthy meeting with Chinese President Xi Jingping but the latter met her briefly, leaving the Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang as her principal interlocutor, according to an earlier ET report. Even foreign minister Wang Yi did not call on the visiting Bangladesh PM.State-run Chinese media did not give adequate coverage to Hasina's visit as well, which was rare as any visiting leader tends to get prominent exposure in official media.Geopolitical observers say with this act, China showed disapproval of her two visits to Delhi ahead of the Beijing trip.These developments may have prompted Hasina, who was scheduled to return from Beijing on July 11, to cut short her visit by a day. She took a return flight on July 10 night, on the pretext of attending to her “ailing daughter”.China has completed a physical survey on the project while India expressed its willingness to do another study regarding the implementation of the Teesta project.According to Bangladeshi officials, China in 2020 proposed a major dredging work on the Teesta River and building reservoirs and embankments without India having to play any role but Bangladesh has kept the billion-dollar project on hold.Ahead of Hasina’s China trip, Beijing had promised $5 billion loan assistance to Dhaka. But it eventually assured a package of only about $100 million, the ET report says citing people aware of the matter.Experts believe that the Chinese involvement in the project could complicate the India-Bangladesh dispute over the major common river.The Teesta water sharing agreement has been in the talks since Hasina’s Awami League party returned to power in 2009.“Bangladesh has a longstanding issue over Teesta River water sharing with India,” she said at a press conference in Dhaka on June 25.“So, it will be easy for Bangladesh if India does the Teesta project. In that case, we won't need to talk about the Teesta water sharing always,” Hasina added.The PM simultaneously said Bangladesh has a longstanding issue with India over water sharing of the 54 common rivers but added that “if there are problems, there are solutions as well"".""India has agreed to cooperate with us on the Teesta project. A joint committee will be formed to decide not only how the water will be shared but also how to revive the river, use it for cultivation in the northern region, and enhance its navigation,” she added.She said the water-sharing discussion included river dredging, constructing embankments and water conservation measures as well.The Teesta river, originating in Sikkim and flowing through West Bengal into Bangladesh, serves as a crucial transboundary river for irrigation and fishing. Bangladesh, with its floodplain spanning 2,750 square kilometres, heavily relies on the Teesta's waters.However, with 83% of the river's catchment area in India and only 17% in Bangladesh, disputes over water withdrawals have led to severe shortages in Bangladesh's five districts during dry seasons.Currently, India claims a 55% share of the Teesta's waters, while Bangladesh contends for a higher allocation, as its current share is less than that of India's.Despite ongoing negotiations since 1986, a formal treaty to resolve the Teesta water-sharing issue remains elusive, contributing to diplomatic tensions between the two nations.Dhaka and New Delhi were set to ink an agreement during former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's Bangladesh visit in 2011 when West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was also supposed to be his entourage member.But Banerjee decided to skip the trip at the last minute, opposing the treaty.In June 2015, ahead of PM Modi's visit to Dhaka, some favourable movement on the treaty was expected, but Mamta Banerjee's stance remained unchanged and hence the new treaty could not be inked.Hydropower on the Teesta is another point of conflict. There are at least 26 projects on the river mostly in Sikkim, aimed at producing some 50,000MW.Bangladesh wants 50% of the Teesta waters between December and May every year, because that's when the water flow to the country drops drastically.“The historical flow of the river at Rangpur [Bangladesh] is 5,000 cusecs, but we're getting only 500 cusecs of water now. This has affected farmers whose standing crops are withering away and also fishermen who are facing loss of livelihood,” a Bangladeshi expert told TOI a couple of years ago.India says it has its own compulsions. “Not enough water is flowing into the Teesta to meet our irrigation needs. We have to increase the area under irrigation in North Bengal to boost agricultural production.“We will achieve our target of bringing in 1.5 lakh acres of farmland,” said then West Bengal irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee in 2021.Media reports suggest that the Bengal government decided in principle to dig two new canals to divert the Teesta waters for irrigation purposes in the Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts.Replying to another query about Banerjee's objection to the Indian government's move over the sharing of Teesta and Ganga water with Bangladesh, Hasina said on June 25 she doesn't want to make any comment over the issue as it is solely their internal matter.But Hasina said she has a good relationship with all the political parties in India including Indian PM Modi and Banerjee.“As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement issued during Hasina’s visit to India on June 22.On December 12, 1996, then Indian PM HD Deve Gowda and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina signed a treaty to share Ganga waters.The 30-year arrangement will expire in December 2026. A joint committee monitors the implementation of the pact. According to the treaty, the Ganga waters are being shared at Farakka (which is the last control structure on river Ganga in India) during the lean period — from January 1 to May 3 every year — on a 10-day period basis.“India will send a technical team after the 1996 Ganges water treaty expires in 2026. The team [with their Bangladesh counterparts] will explore options and negotiate the terms,” Hasina told reporters.",Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says India has the right on the Teesta water conservation and associated special economic zone (SEZ) project. India and China are competing to build the mega project on the cross-border river involving a reservoir. New Delhi is believed to have reservations over China's potential involvement in the project near its strategic Siliguri Corridor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111781506,imgsize-2136639,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/111781506.jpg"
Ganga Expressway: Ganga Expressway to Open Before Maha Kumbh in Uttar Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ganga-expressway-to-open-before-maha-kumbh-in-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/111767786.cms,"Main corridor to be ready before Dec 31 deadline

LUCKNOW: With work progressing according to the timeline even during the monsoon, the 594-km Ganga Expressway is set to be opened to the public by Dec 31.The ambitious project of the Yogi Adityanath government will connect the Bijauli locality in Meerut with Judapur Dandu in Prayagraj. The addition of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway will thus provide a seamless drive between Delhi and Prayagraj in approximately seven hours.The state government has asked the agencies executing the project to expedite the construction of the two major bridges — a 960-metre-long bridge between Meerut and Badaun (over the Ganga) and a 720-metre-long bridge between Badaun and Hardoi (over the Ramganga).The entire stretch of the six-lane expressway will comprise 14 major bridges, 7 railway overbridges, 32 flyovers, and a 3.5-km-long airstrip for the emergency landing of fighter planes in the Jalalabad area of Shahjahanpur district.The Expressways Industrial Authority ( UPEIDA ) has asked officials to ensure that all the essential structures and the high-speed corridor are ready before the deadline (Dec 31) so that it can help facilitate the movement of motor vehicles to Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh in January next year. Being constructed with a budget of Rs 36,230 crore, the Ganga Expressway will provide accessibility and connectivity to 12 districts.A total of 7,453 hectares of land spanning over 518 villages has been aggregated for the project.Having a right-of-way width of 120 meters, the expressway will have six lanes with a scope to add two more lanes in the future as per future need.While the speed limit will be fixed once the stretch is ready, UPEIDA officials said that the agencies executing the work have been asked to design the expressway to facilitate the commute of vehicle owners at the speed of 120 km per hour.Divided into four segments, the Meerut-Badaun section (129.70 km) is being built by IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited, while the remaining three segments Badaun-Hardoi (151.70 km), Hardoi-Unnao (155.70 km), and Unnao-Prayagraj (156.85 km) are being constructed by Adani Infrastructure.Sharing more details, a senior officer from the authority said that 82% of the earthwork has been done on the main carriageway. Similarly, the sub-base on 58% of the carriageway is complete, while bituminous macadam has been rolled out over 50% of the 596-km-long stretch. Out of the 1,481 structures, the two construction agencies have already commissioned 1,215 structures.While two main toll plazas will be constructed over the carriageway in Meerut and Prayagraj, 15 more plazas will come up on the entry and exit ramps. Nine facilities will also be set up on the route to cater to the commuters.“The expressway will bring down the commute time between west and east Uttar Pradesh,” said the officer.","The ambitious project of the Yogi Adityanath government will connect the Bijauli locality in Meerut with Judapur Dandu in Prayagraj.

Kanchanjunga Express accident was 'waiting to happen': Railway safety report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kanchanjunga-express-accident-was-waiting-to-happen-railway-safety-report/articleshow/111776833.cms,"Kanchanjunga Express accident (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) has said that the Kanchanjunga Express accident, which claimed ten lives including the loco pilot of the goods train was ""waiting to happen"" because of multiple lapses in train operations management in automatic signal zones and ""inadequate counselling"" of loco pilots and station masters.The CRS, in its report, recommended the immediate implementation of the Automatic Train-protection system (KAVACH) to avoid future occurrences.Following an investigation, the CRS identified that a ""wrong paper authority"" or T/A 912 to cross defective signals had been issued to the loco pilot of the goods train involved in the crash. The paper authority failed to specify the speed the goods train should adhere to while crossing the defective signal.""Due to improper authority and that too without adequate information, such an incident was an 'accident-in-waiting,'"" the CRS report stated, highlighting the lapses in rail administration.Besides the Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train, five other trains had entered the section after the signals became defective until the accident occurred. The CRS noted that despite issuing the same authority, different speed patterns were followed by the loco pilots, with only the Kanchanjunga Express adhering to the norm of moving at a maximum speed of 15 kmph and stopping for one minute at each defective signal.""This shows that 'action to be taken when T/A 912 is issued to them is not clear. Some of the loco pilots have followed the 15 kmph rule while most of the loco pilots did not follow this rule. The absence of proper authority and that too without adequate information created misinterpretation and misunderstanding about the speed to be followed,'"" the report said.The CRS emphasized the inadequate counselling of loco pilots and station masters regarding train operation in automatic signalling territory, creating misinterpretations and misunderstandings of rules. The incident was classified under the ""Error in Train Working"" category.“The large number of signalling failures in automatic signalling territory is a cause of concern and should be taken up with those concerned to improve the reliability of the system,” the CRS report noted. The report cited 208 cases of Signal Passing at Danger (red signal overshooting) from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2024, including 12 cases resulting in collisions, underscoring the limitations of preventive measures taken by zonal railways such as loco pilot counselling, safety drives, etc.“This underscores the need for implementation of the Automatic Train-protection system (KAVACH) on top priority. Use of non-signalling-based systems such as Artificial intelligence-based detection of the RED aspect of the signal and providing an early warning to the loco pilot/GPS-based anti-collision systems shall be explored for provision in locomotive cabs across Indian Railways in non-ATP (automatic train protection) territory,” the report recommended.The investigation also revealed a shortage of walkie-talkies in the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) Zone, where the accident occurred, preventing the goods train crew from being issued this critical safety equipment.In the event of multiple signal failures, the CRS highlighted three potential courses of action for the rail administration, none of which were fully followed in this incident. The first option was for drivers to follow the general rule of stopping the train for one minute at the defective signal and proceeding with great caution until the next stop signal. The second option was issuing a T/A 912 form with a caution order specifying the speed to be maintained, which was not done in this case. The third option was treating the scenario as a ""major signal failure"" and using the Automatic Block System, whereby only one train is allowed between two stations until the preceding train clears the next station.The CRS pointed out that the control office at the divisional level should be staffed round-the-clock by one Senior Section Engineer, one Junior Engineer, and one helper in an 8-hour shift. However, on the night of June 16 and June 17, the signalling control office was manned only by a technician.“It is not possible to manage such a major signalling failure by a staff of technician level. The response of higher officials of the signalling department at the divisional level posted at Katihar has been found lackluster as despite being informed about this serious failure, none of them went to the control office to manage and coordinate with other departments for timely attention of signalling failures,"" the report said.Since the introduction of automatic signalling in January 2023, the CRS stressed the necessity of implementing all applicable rules at the field level. The prevalent misinterpretation of rules indicated the lack of a system of checks and balances at the headquarters level.","The Kanchanjunga Express accident claimed ten lives including the loco pilot of the goods train.

Art has long been a profound medium through which human creativity, emotion, and history are expressed, and paintings are among the most celebrated forms of this expression. Masterpieces by artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, and Gustav Klimt not only capture the aesthetic beauty but also reflect the cultural and historical contexts of their times.From the intricate details and symbolic richness of da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi"" to the vibrant abstraction of Pollock's ""Number 17A,"" each painting offers a unique glimpse into the artist's vision and the era they represent. These artworks continue to captivate and inspire, standing as timeless testaments to the power of human imagination and artistic skill.Expensive paintings in the world captivate with their artistic brilliance, historical significance, and investment value. These works are coveted by collectors and institutions alike, symbolising cultural prestige and wealth highlighting the enduring allure of fine art. The market for these extraordinary pieces continues to thrive, driven by a deep appreciation for artistic genius and heritage. This list of paintings are the costliest arts in the world.Acclaimed as the world's most expensive painting. Depicting Jesus Christ as the Savior of the World, this masterpiece was lost for many years before being rediscovered. Initially mistaken for a copy, it underwent restoration and was authenticated as an original da Vinci. Its 2017 sale for $450.3 million sparked controversy and debates about its authenticity. The anonymity of the buyer added to its enigma.This marks a significant moment in American art history, highlighting the post-World War II transition to abstraction. Painted in 1955, this work exemplifies de Kooning's blend of abstract and figurative styles. Its sale in September 2015 for a record price, purchased by hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin included another de Kooning piece, ""Woman III.""This is a series of oil paintings from the early 1890s, crucial in bridging 19th-century Impressionism and 20th-century Cubism. The series portrays Provençal peasants absorbed in their card game, reflecting Cézanne's focus on depicting everyday life with simplicity and solidity. These works are notable for simplifying complex scenes into basic shapes, a technique that influenced modernist artists. The sale of one version to the Royal Family of Qatar in 2011 underscores Cézanne's lasting impact on art history.The meaning of the painting defines ""When Will You Marry?"" in Tahitian, was painted in 1892 during his first visit to Tahiti. This vibrant artwork, sold for around $210 million in 2015, ranks among the most expensive paintings ever. Featuring two Tahitian women set against a lush landscape, the piece reflects Gauguin's fascination with Tahitian culture, exoticism, and the concept of an untouched paradise. Its bold colours, strong outlines, and simplified forms signify Gauguin's shift from Impressionism to Symbolism and hint at the emergence of Primitivism in art.The painting was created in 1948, exemplifies his groundbreaking drip painting technique, which played a key role in advancing the Abstract Expressionist movement. This artwork is characterised by a dynamic and intricate web of dripped and splattered paint, where the act of painting itself becomes the focal point. Pollock's innovative style diverged from traditional methods, emphasising the rhythm, motion, and expressive nature of the artist's process.Painted by the Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn in 1636, ""The Standard Bearer"" highlights Rembrandt's exceptional ability to capture human emotion and his masterful use of chiaroscuro, or light and shadow. The painting depicts a military figure, possibly a self-portrait, holding a standard and dressed in lavish attire, showcasing Rembrandt's fascination with historical and allegorical themes. Renowned for their psychological depth and pioneering techniques, Rembrandt's works have left a lasting influence on generations of artists and continue to captivate audiences and collectors around the world.Mark Rothko's ""No. 6 (Violet, Green and Red),"" painted in 1951, is celebrated for its rich, vibrant colours and large, soft-edged forms. This piece exemplifies Rothko's signature approach to creating immersive colour fields designed to elicit profound emotional responses. Through this painting, Rothko explored the spiritual and emotional potential of colour, inviting viewers into a meditative and introspective experience.Gustav Klimt, a prominent Austrian Symbolist painter, created the exquisite ""Wasserschlangen II"" (Water Serpents II) between 1904 and 1907. This artwork is celebrated for its opulent style and sensual depiction of the female form, set in an ethereal aquatic environment. The painting exemplifies Klimt's fascination with eroticism and the female body, characterised by intricate patterns, vibrant colours, and a fusion of realism and fantasy. This piece is a quintessential example of Klimt's 'Golden Phase,' showcasing his signature blend of decorative and symbolic elements.Created by Rembrandt in 1634, these pendant portraits depict the newly married couple Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit in lavish attire, highlighting the wealth and status of Amsterdam's elite in the 17th century. These life-size portraits demonstrate Rembrandt's exceptional skill in portraiture, capturing the textures of fabrics and the intricacies of human expression through his masterful use of light and shadow. The joint purchase of these masterpieces by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Louvre in Paris ensures that they will be displayed alternately in both museums, making these culturally significant works accessible to a wider audience.""Les Femmes d'Alger (Version O)"" by Pablo Picasso is a landmark painting in modern art history. Created in 1955, this piece is part of a series of 15 paintings and numerous drawings inspired by Eugène Delacroix's 1834 work ""The Women of Algiers."" Noted for its vibrant colour palette and complex geometric composition, this version showcases Picasso's unique style of Cubism, which revolutionised 20th-century art. The series also served as Picasso's tribute to his late friend and rival, Henri Matisse.

"Month after formation of new govt, TTD administration remains more or less the same",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/month-after-formation-of-new-govt-ttd-administration-remains-more-or-less-the-same/articleshow/111815919.cms,"TIRUPATI: Administrative and pilgrim affairs at the world renowned Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams remains more or less the same under the present regime even though the new govt assumed office a month ago.Exactly a month ago after assuming charge as the new chief minister of the state, Nara Chandrababu Naidu expressed anguish over the sorry state of affairs at Tirumala and vowed to streamline the administration and the govt beginning with TTD.Apart from appointing senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new TTD EO, transferring out IPS officer D Narasimha Kishore from the post of TTD CVSO and clearing the decks for the appointment of 2005 batch IRS officer as the new TTD JEO at Tirumala, there has been no significant changes effected by the new govt in the TTD in the last one month.Former TTD board member G Bhanu Prakash Reddy observed that the reason behind the sluggish pace at which the streamlining of the administrative and pilgrim affairs at the TTD is because the govt is digging deeper into the misdeeds of the previous TTD trust boards during the five years YSRCP regime.""The govt has already launched a vigilance and enforcement probe into the irregularities reported in the TTD in the last five years. The outcome of the probe will bring to light the damage done to this great spiritual organisation during the YSRCP regime. On the other-hand the new NDA govt is committed to streamlining the existing systems at the TTD and provide a transparent and corruption free administration in the next five years"", Bhanu Prakash Reddy noted.Journalist turned MLA from Puthalapattu Dr K Murali Mohan pointed out that significant changes in terms of improving the quality of Naivedya prasadams and Anna prasadams offered to the devotees in the last one month. Also, the supply of milk, water and food to the devotees in the queue lines has also been improved.Amidst criticism that most of the staffers serving at the key offices at Tirumala including the Tirumala temple, JEO camp office, Padmavathi and MBC reception counters, Revenue and panchayat departments, were appointed in their present positions during the YSRCP regime and continue to vow their allegiance to their previous political bosses, the TDP MLA felt that all these staffers serving in the key positions will be transferred out to other departments once the administrative top brass at the TTD settle down in their functionary positions.",Administrative and pilgrim affairs at the world renowned Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams remains more or less the same under the present regime.

ICC AGM: Will Jay Shah take over as chairman or Barclay will continue till 2025?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/icc-agm-will-jay-shah-take-over-as-chairman-or-barclay-will-continue-till-2025/articleshow/111815115.cms,"NEW DELHI: The upcoming ICC Annual Conference in Colombo, starting on Friday, will be a significant event for the cricketing world. All eyes will be on BCCI secretary Jay Shah , as there might be serious discussions about when he will take over from New Zealander Greg Barclay as the chairman of the global body.One of the major topics expected to dominate the conference is the financial losses incurred by the ICC for hosting T20 World Cup games in the United States of America.Reports suggest that the losses amount to more than USD 20 million. While the nine-point agenda of the AGM does not explicitly include the financial details, it will be discussed as a ""post-event report,"" which is a standard operating procedure.The appointment of ICC's new external auditor is also on the agenda, along with discussions on ICC memberships , reports from associate members' meetings, and the presentation of ICC development awards.An important issue that is not part of the ICC Board's official agenda but may be brought up under ""Any Other Business"" is India's decision not to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy .According to an ICC source, one of the main areas of interest for everyone at the ICC is when Jay Shah will take over the reins of the world body. The source stated, ""It is not about how but when, as he still has one year left as BCCI secretarybefore his cooling off period in Indian board starts in 2025 as per constitution. However, if he has to take over in 2025, then Barclay can't complete his third term of two years from December 2024 to December 2026.""There is speculation that the ICC's chairmanship term could be changed from three terms of two years each to two terms of three years, allowing the cumulative term to remain six years.This would enable Shah to complete his six years as BCCI secretary and take over as ICC chairman in 2025 for three years when he will be in a cooling-off period in the BCCI. Subsequently, in 2028, he could return and take over as the board president.","ICC Annual Conference in Colombo, starting on Friday, will be a significant event for the cricketing world.

Largest India-built research vessel to help NCPOR tap metal wealth’s depths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/largest-india-built-research-vessel-to-help-ncpor-tap-metal-wealths-depths/articleshow/111817413.cms,":

PANAJIIndia’s deep-ocean scan for rare minerals and metals will be propelled to greater depths of understanding with the Vasco-based National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research ( NCPOR ) ordering a new ocean research vessel .As part of the country’s deep-ocean mission, the 89.5m vessel — the largest research ship to be built in an Indian shipyard — will explore the Indian Ocean for minerals and metals.The vessel will be built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) on a Rs 839.5 crore contract. The vessel is expected to be ready in three years. The vessel will not only be able to undertake deep ocean missions but will also be able to embark on Southern Ocean studies.“The ship is meant for deep sea exploration of minerals and rare metals. Govt has funded the ship under the deep-ocean mission to push for the exploration of marine metals,” said NCPOR director Thamban Meloth. “We are looking for metallic sulphides, which have copper, zinc, and other metals important for future technologies.”The NCPOR’s research is restricted because of the lack of a capable vessel.“The current ship is very old and cannot undertake such expeditions,” Meloth said. “The new ship will be able to operate in cold waters and light ice conditions in the Southern Ocean, though it will not be able to go to Antarctica.”The vessel will have a maximum speed of 14 knots (25kmph) and will be equipped with laboratories, scientific equipment, and facilities. They will include a multi-beam bathymetry system, multichannel seismics, ocean profilers, seabed samplers, onboard analytical systems, and heavy-duty deck machinery.The vessel is designed to minimise underwater radiated noise.The vessel will have all-weather capability, the capacity to carry 34 scientists, and is expected to serve India for the next 30 years.The new ship will be built under the dual classification of Indian Register of Shipping and American Bureau of Shipping and will conform to the latest marine pollution standards of International Maritime Organisation.","The vessel will be built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) on a Rs 839.5 crore contract.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
