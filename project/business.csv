'Total incompetence': Congress on NEET-PG exam postponement

Congress blames PM Modi and his team for NEET-PG postponement due to incompetence.

NEW DELHI: The next date for conduct of NEET PG is likely to be announced this week. NEET-PG was postponed on Saturday, less than 12 hours before it was scheduled to be held.NEET-PG, an entrance examination conducted by National Board of Examination (NBE) to determine eligibility for admission to postgraduate medical programmes in govt and private medical colleges across the country, was postponed on Saturday, less than 12 hours before it was scheduled to be held.NBE president Dr Abhijat Sheth told TOI that they are working closely to ensure that the exam happens soon. ""We should be able to decide the exam date by this week,"" Dr Sheth said.He expressed regret over the sudden postponement of the NEET PG exam on Sunday for which more than two lakh students have applied this year.

At the same time, we are working closely to ensure that this happens soon rather than late,"" the NBE president said.Last minute cancellation of the NEET PG exam led to distress among the applicants and several of them criticised the govt for the move.

Koya, a senior citizen retired from the Kerala Police Service, stated that his father Kunji Koya went to Karachi, Pakistan in 1953 in search of employment and worked as a helper in a hotel there for a short period. Later, he returned to India and passed away at the age of 93 in Parappanangadi, Malappuram in 1995.When the petitioner approached the village officer (VO) to pay the property tax for 2022-23, it was declined. The VO informed him that the tehsildar had instructed him not to collect the tax on the property based on the guidance of the Custodian of Enemy Property of India (CEPI). Additionally, it was revealed that the CEPI had initiated a national investigation into several properties, including 60 immovable properties in Kerala. The petitioner's father was suspected to be an enemy (a Pakistani national) under Section 2(b) of the Enemy Property Act, 1968, and consequently, the portion of the property inherited by the petitioner was also suspected to be an 'enemy property'.Ummar Koya argued that due to continuous harassment by police authorities who branded his father as a Pakistani citizen, he had approached the central govt to determine his national status as an Indian citizen. It was confirmed that his father had not voluntarily acquired Pakistani citizenship and thus remained an Indian citizen.Despite the central gov's contention that the petitioner's father could be classified as an 'enemy' under the Defence of India Act because he resided in Pakistan, the bench ruled that he did not fall under this definition in both the Defence of India Acts of 1962 and 1971. Kunji Koya was an Indian citizen, and the bench emphasized that the CEPI had no evidence to support allegations of trading with an 'enemy' or involvement in any business with an 'enemy firm'. Consequently, the bench quashed the CEPI proceedings and directed revenue officials to collect property tax from the petitioner.","Ummar Koya, a senior citizen retired from the Kerala Police Service, stated that his father Kunji Koya went to Karachi, Pakistan in 1953 in search of employment and worked as a helper in a hotel there for a short period.

PM Modi likely to visit Russia next month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-likely-to-visit-russia-next-month/articleshow/111267688.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit Moscow next month for the India-Russia annual summit, the highest institutionalised dialogue mechanism between the two countries. While an official announcement is awaited, both sides are exploring dates in the second week of July for the proposed day-long visit. July 9 is one of the dates being considered.If the visit happens, and with no other foreign visit scheduled for the PM in the next few weeks, it may also turn out to be Modi's first bilateral visit since the inauguration of his third consecutive term in office earlier this month. Previously, he has chosen to visit countries in the neighbourhood after assuming office.The visit will take place days after the SCO summit in Astana, which Modi has decided to skip this time. It will also be his first visit to the country since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Modi, in fact, last visited Russia in 2019. The PM is expected to visit Russia again later this year for the BRICS summit.While 21 such annual summits have taken place so far alternatively in India and Russia, this will be the first time Modi will travel to Russia for the same since 2019. The summit couldn't take place in 2020 because of Covid-19 but President Vladimir Putin did come the next year for the 21st summit, although only for a few hours. Modi was expected to travel to Russia for the next summit in 2022 but that summit never materialised amid increasing global uncertainty and Russia's preoccupation with the Ukraine war.A Putin aide was quoted as saying Tuesday preparations are on for the visit.While the leaders did meet on the margins of the SCO summit in Samarkand in 2022, where Modi told Putin this isn't the era of war, the upcoming meeting under the annual summit mechanism will provide them an opportunity to undertake the most comprehensive review of bilateral relations - spanning across energy, defence, trade, nuclear cooperation, defence and space - since Putin's visit to India in 2021.There has been a dramatic growth in energy ties between the two countries since the outbreak of the war, mainly because of India's decision to ramp up oil imports from Russia despite the objections raised initially by the West. India and China remain the only major countries to have not explicitly condemned Russia for its actions in Ukraine.Like in the 2021 summit, the meeting on this occasion too will witness the signing of several agreements and MoUs. Russia said last week it has finalised a draft logistics agreement for intensifying military exchanges but India has remained silent on the issue. A Kremlin spokesman had said in March Modi had an open invitation to visit Russia and that Moscow in any case was expecting bilateral talks in the first half of the year on the margins of a multilateral event. There were concerns that Russia may have reservations about Modi not himself attending the SCO summit but the standalone visit to Moscow will likely take care of that.","PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit Moscow next month for the India-Russia annual summit.

NEW DELHI: In the 350th contract under its flagship iDEX (innovations for defence excellence) initiative, the defence ministry on Tuesday inked a deal for the design and development of a miniature observation and imaging satellite for the IAF. The contract was inked with SpacePixxel Technologies Pvt Ltd for the miniaturised satellite capable of carrying electro-optical, infrared, synthetic aperture radar, and hyperspectral payloads up to 150 kg. ""The company has been actively working to build and launch high-resolution hyperspectral imaging satellites to provide detailed earth observation data,"" a MoD official said.

""This 350th iDEX contract enables innovation in space electronics, wherein many payloads earlier deployed on dedicated large satellites are now being miniaturised,"" he added.

The small modular satellite will integrate multiple miniaturised payloads as per requirement, providing advantages like faster and economical deployment, ease of manufacturing, scalability, adaptability, and less environmental impact.

The 150th iDEX contract was signed in December 2022, and within a span of 18 months, the 350th contract has now been signed. Defence secretary Giridhar Aramane appreciated the ""unwavering commitment"" of new defence innovators for pushing the boundaries of technology and safeguarding the nation, and assured them of all possible support.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest. When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

NHIDCL accused of serious corruption in Tripura’s road construction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhidcl-accused-of-serious-corruption-in-tripuras-road-construction/articleshow/111266385.cms,"AGARTALA: After the repeated collapse of newly built National Highways in Tripura in the past three months in several locations, National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) authority has been accused of faulty construction compromising quality.There is another allegation against NHIDCL that in the name of widening the roads, thousands of old trees were chopped off. However, the contractors in connivance with the officials of NHIDCL and State Forest department assessed less number of trees and paid less to the compensation funds, especially in the Champaknagar area, Manu-Kanchanpur section, and Amtali-Sabroom section of National Highway.The officials here on Tuesday said NHIDCL was created in 2015 to speed up the highway construction in Northeastern states and in the last five years at least 22 roads across Tripura have been awarded to NHIDCL from state PWD.In all the cases, complaints came for poor work and not following the engineering codes, which the experts advised to maintain in the hill region, officials stated.“Most unusually roads collapsed in several locations on Agartala-Sabroom National Highway, Agartala-Kailashahar via Khowai and Kamalpur National Highway, Agartala-Churaibari National Highway, and Vaghmun-Simlung section on NH-44A within two and three years of construction causing damaged to private properties and sufferings in public life,” said officials.The issue got complicated after villagers from Vanghmun in Jampui Hill, along the Tripura-Mizoram border in the eastern boundary of the state, agitated last week and submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister demanding save Tlaksih village, which has faced a threat of existence due to construction of NH 44A connecting Agartala (Tripura) with Aizawl (Mizoram).The villagers alleged due to negligence, apathy, and arrogance of NHIDCL as many as 65 houses having 272 population in the face of imminent disaster.Based on the memorandum, Additional Secretary of Tripura government Tamal Majumdar wrote to the MD NHIDCL describing that additional cracks have been developed in the affected Tlaksih Village.The villagers are living in fear of further disasters, prompting them to protest on the street and there is multiple media coverage on the aggrieved situation of Tlaksih Village.With the onset of monsoon season, landslides have already occurred in several areas along NH-44A, turning it into a high-risk zone. However, the matter has been unresolved for more than a year, and asked him to consider it as ‘Top Most Priority’.Tlaksih, a picturesque century-old village in Jampui Hill witnessed severe landslides after construction work of the NH 44A Manu-Simlung section was started by NHIDCL.The villagers complained eastern half of the village had slid and sank and a year ago developed further cracks, making a large area inhabitable believed to be unscientific alignment and construction.“At least 14 houses have been already damaged and abandoned, and about seven acres of plantation crops have already been destroyed, 30 graves have been damaged and the villagers had to re-bury the mortal remains exposed in a makeshift donated land,” the villagers alleged.The lone government school of the village is also affected by the slide and has to be abandoned and the only approach road towards the village centre is too steep and curvy, they pointed out.Meanwhile, experts observed that NHIDCL didn’t follow the engineering norms when it came to the construction of roads in Tripura. In the name of straightening roads, they cut down the hills without proper assessment of topography, river course, and soil pattern.As a result, all those newly built roads in Tripura became vulnerable, and added, “Future of these roads is very critical because, after five years when NHIDCL contractors hand over them to state PWD, the state government cannot maintain them as there will be a regular fault.”","National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) has been accused of faulty construction compromising quality.

Income criteria set to be tweaked for MIGs to be eligible for govt aid for building houses in urban areas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/income-criteria-set-to-be-tweaked-for-migs-to-be-eligible-for-govt-aid-for-building-houses-in-urban-areas/articleshow/111266085.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt is set to bring down the income criteria for middle income groups (MIGs) to be eligible for getting govt assistance for buying or building houses in cities and towns under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban), which is likely to be part of the full budget for 2024-25. The objective is better targeting of the scheme, sources said.In the first leg of PMAY(U), which covered 1.19 crore houses, govt had put the MIG under two categories — MIG-I households having an annual income of Rs 6 lakh-Rs 12 lakh and households with annual income of Rs 12 lakh to Rs 18 lakh were put under MIG-II category. Sources said now the proposal is to rationalise this criteria and there may only be one MIG category.An official in the housing and urban affairs ministry said modalities of the next phase of PMAY(U) are currently being worked out and it may be launched in less than a month. In its first Cabinet meeting, govt had given go ahead for providing financial assistance to build one crore houses in urban areas and another two crore in rural areas in the next five years.“The second phase of the scheme will soon be launched and it will be based on the learnings of the first phase with the focus on better targeting of the scheme, no delay in disbursement to the beneficiaries and ease of living,” an official said. The scheme will have three categories — Economically Weaker Section (EWS), Low Income Group (LIG) and MIG.The urban component of PMAY was launched on June 25, 2015 with a vision of providing “Housing for All”. Under the scheme, 1.14 crore houses have been grounded for construction, over 84 lakh houses have been completed and delivered to the beneficiaries.As on date, out of the committed central assistance of Rs 2 lakh crore, govt has released Rs 1.64 lakh crore. Under the scheme, 94 lakh houses are registered in the name of women and around 25 lakh houses are under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme where Centre pays upfront assistance in the form of interest subsidy for bank loans.","Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban) likely to be part of full budget for 2024-25.

Another dirty NEET secret? Students' ranks jump on 2nd attempt from obscure centres,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-dirty-neet-secret-students-ranks-jump-on-2nd-attempt-from-obscure-centres/articleshow/111240029.cms,"Experts: NEET issue not local, likely to have ‘large spread'

MUMBAI: When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range. However, in her second attempt the following year, her rank leapfrogged from 2 lakh-plus to 8,000. At present, the 20-year-old is a student of LTMG Sion Hospital in Mumbai.Another aspirant from 2022 who had secured a rank beyond 10 lakh now studies in a govt hospital in Mumbai after she secured a rank of around 13,000 in her second attempt in 2023.This ""second-time lucky"" trend, with students scoring ""unbelievable"" ranks after taking a year's break to prepare for the second attempt, has been seen as baffling by academics in medical corridors. And there was a common thread: the second time, each had taken the exam from an obscure centre. While some took it from a tiny village in Belagavi, others opted for a small town near Patna and other places not popular as coaching hubs.Govt sources said attempts are on to make a list of students who scored well in their second attempt at obscure centres and are now pursuing MBBS in govt-run medical colleges.This year, a similar scenario emerged when students from various states opted to take the exam from a school in Godhra, Gujarat. The Gujarat police, who blew the lid off the scam, said students were asked to fill answers for the questions they knew and leave the rest unanswered.""The empty answer-sheets were to be filled in by the centre's deputy superintendent during the half-hour gap the supervisors get to pack the papers. The answer key was to be provided by coaching institutes, which make the key available online after the exam,"" Godhra superintendent of police Himanshu Solanki said. A counsellor said police should investigate how students managed to get allocated to centres that are ""compromised"".When candidates fill their NEET (UG) application, they are expected to give two cities as options for exam centres. Parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said, ""Before filling the form in Feb, parents called me about agents who had said that they would fill the form for the candidates and that exam centres would be far from cities.""They had assured the parents that their child would get ‘high’ rank and demanded Rs 1 lakh as advance and Rs 9 lakh after the results. I had dissuaded them from falling into any such trap, parent representative and counsellor Sudha Shenoy said.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has always maintained that a computer randomly generates an exam centre based on the choice of cities given by each candidate. “If computer-generated centres are given, how are students who have paid ending up in compromised exam centres,” asked Shenoy.In another instance last year, a private university’s head was surprised to find the brightest first-year students failing on concepts that they had cracked in the entrance test conducted by the university just about 10 months ago and analysed the problem closely to find that some of their exam centres were compromised. “We changed the test agency we worked with. We realised that the exam centres were compromised,” the head of the university, who did not want to be named, told TOI.Experts said the NEET 2024 controversy is not just “local” but probably one with a “large spread.” The NTA needs to “look closely” at the system and “find gaps and fix them”, they said.Student representative and counsellor Sachin Bangad said, “A student should be allotted a local centre based on the combination of where the candidate took the Class X, XII exams and the address on the Aadhar card. Additionally, govt officials need to be roped in for supervision. Like in the polling system, they should be informed merely a night before where their exam supervision duty is.”An officer, who has worked with the Maharashtra admission process for decades, said NEET should be conducted on computers for safety reasons. “Additionally, the new provisions brought in for the post-graduate test, to break down the test into multiple-timed sections that cannot be revisited once the time is up, should also be brought into the UG test,” the officer added.","When Ashalata (name changed) took the NEET for the first time in 2022, her rank was in the six-digit range.

(With inputs from agencies)

More than 1,300 pilgrims died during this year’s Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia , facing soaring temperatures that reached up to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit). The Saudi authorities announced the toll on Sunday, revealing that most of the deceased were unauthorized pilgrims who lacked official permits and faced extreme heat without adequate shelter.Saudi health minister Fahd Al-Jalajel reported that 83% of the 1,301 fatalities were among unauthorized pilgrims who had to walk long distances under the intense sun. Many suffered from chronic diseases or were elderly, exacerbating their vulnerability to the harsh conditions. The minister emphasized that the health system provided extensive medical services , including to those who were not officially registered for Haj.Here is an FAQs on extreme heat wave during Haj in Saudi ArabiaThe extreme heat in Saudi Arabia, with temperatures soaring as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius, played a significant role in the high number of fatalities. Many of the deceased were unauthorized pilgrims who walked long distances under the sun without adequate shelter or comfort. According to Saudi Health Minister Fahd Al-Jalajel, ""deaths were caused by pilgrims walking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort.""A total of 1,301 people died during this year's Haj. Among the fatalities, 83% were unauthorized pilgrims. Notably, Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths, with 630 of them being unregistered pilgrims. Additionally, there were significant numbers of deaths among pilgrims from Indonesia, India, Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Malaysia, and two U.S. citizens.Saudi authorities provided extensive medical services, including 465,000 specialized treatments. They also deployed over 1,600 personnel with medical units and 30 rapid response teams specifically for heatstroke , along with 5,000 health and first aid volunteers. However, many unauthorized pilgrims did not receive the necessary support, leading to tragic outcomes.The Egyptian government took immediate action by revoking the licenses of 16 travel agencies that facilitated unauthorized pilgrimages and referred their managers to the public prosecutor. The agencies had organized Haj trips using visas that did not allow entry to Mecca, leaving many pilgrims stranded and vulnerable to the extreme heat.The tragic loss affected many families worldwide, including Saida Wurie from the US, whose parents died during Haj. They had saved their entire lives for the pilgrimage, spending $23,000 on an all-inclusive package. In an interview to CNN, Wurie criticized the tour company for not providing proper transportation or credentials, which left her parents unprepared for the harsh conditions.Wurie said that the tour operator failed to adequately equip her parents for their journey. She feels that the services provided by the company fell short of what was promised and did not align with the financial investment made by her parents. In her view, the tour operator had an obligation to ensure her parents were well-prepared for the trip, but ultimately did not fulfill this responsibility. ""They saved their whole lives for this,"" she lamented, expressing heartbreak over their unfulfilled dream and their untimely deaths due to heatstroke.A senior Saudi official defended the state's response, stating, ""The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgment on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks."" The health minister also described the management of this year's Haj as ""successful,"" despite the high death toll, highlighting the extensive medical services provided.Deaths during Haj are not uncommon due to the large number of participants and the challenging conditions. In 2015, a stampede in Mina resulted in over 2,400 deaths, the deadliest incident in Haj's history. Extreme heat has also been a recurring issue, with predictions indicating that future Haj pilgrimages will continue to face dangerously high temperatures due to climate change.","More than 1,300 pilgrims died during this year’s Haj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.

ST driver-conductor’s detour to save ailing tribal boy goes in vain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/st-driver-conductors-detour-to-save-ailing-tribal-boy-goes-in-vain/articleshow/111267560.cms,"NAGPUR: In an ironic turn to a humane effort, a state transport bus driver-conductor’s valiant attempt to save an ailing four-year-old tribal boy in the Maoist heartland of Gadchiroli went in vain on Monday. The boy could not be saved, but the incident highlighted poor healthcare infrastructure in the district.Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( MSRTC ) bus driver Gaurav Amle and conductor Milan Gavai deviated from the designated Bhamragarh-Nagpur route and took the bus (with nearly 45 passengers) to Allapalli, ensure that the child, Aryan Talande, gets immediate medical assistance.The Nagpur-bound MSRTC bus, which belonged to Nagpur’s Imambada depot, was passing through Perimili when the hapless Talande family boarded the bus with the child wrapped in a bedsheet as no ambulance or other transport was available in the early hours of the day. Gavai spotted Aryan getting convulsions in the lap of his mother.The Talande family from Koreli village of Aheri taluka had rushed Aryan, who had various health complications arising out of jaundice, to Perimili primary health centre (PHC), 3km away from their village, after his health deteriorated. Perimili PHC staffers referred him to Aheri’s taluka-level rural hospital, which had better facilities.The family was restless with the child in their arms as he seemed to be gradually sinking. Sensing the gravity of the situation, Amle, without thinking twice, decided he must act fast. Going beyond the call of duty, he took a detour to reach the nearest PHC at Alapalli. But the PHC doctors pronounced Aryan dead. The news left the Talande family crestfallen, so were Amle, Gavai and the bus passengers. However, Alapalli residents lauded Amle’s effort.Imambada depot manager Swati Tambe, who praised Amle-Gavai duo’s humane gesture, informed that the Talande family wanted to get off the bus about a km ahead of Alapalli as they realised that Aryan’s life was on the brink. “Gavai felt it would be inhumane to allow the family to get down at a village. He convinced other passengers about the urgency of the detour. He learnt Aheri rural govt hospital was 10km away but the closest medical facility at Alapalli PHC was 2km away,” said Tambe.Tambe said the bus was taken to Alapalli PHC instead of heading to Aheri as per the itinerary just to save the boy. “When Amle-Gavai duo realized that the boy was no more, they summoned an ambulance service to help the grieving family return to their village,” said Tambe. Amle also paid the family’s bus fare from his pocket and refunded amount to them.According to Tiger Group representative Sai Tusligari, they had rushed to Alapalli PHC with their ambulance, but it was too late. “There is an acute shortage of 108 ambulances in the district, especially in Aheri and south Gadchiroli,” said Tulsigari, adding that the rural hospital at Aheri too has doctors and nurses but the facility is marred by poor infrastructure and facilities.","A bus driver-conductor took a detour to save a four-year-old tribal boy.

Government aims for Rs 10,000 crore revenue

The 5G spectrum auction began today, i.e., June 25, with telecom operators bidding Rs 11,259.11 crore in the first day's five rounds, according to the Day 1 report published on the Department of Telecommunications website. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) sold 141 MHz of spectrum out of 10,522.35 MHz available, primarily focusing on mid and low-frequency bands, the report revealed.Three major players - Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea - are participating in the auction. The three telecom operators have collectively deposited Rs 4,350 crore as earnest money, significantly lower than previous auctions. Reliance Jio submitted the highest deposit at Rs 3,000 crore, while Bharti Airtel deposited Rs 1,050 crore, and Vodafone Idea put in Rs 300 crore.The Day 1 report indicates that the 900 MHz band attracted the most interest, with 60.4 MHz sold for Rs 7,004 crore. The 1800 MHz band saw 50.6 MHz sold for Rs 3,614 crore, and the 2100 MHz band had 20 MHz sold for Rs 546 crore. Telecom companies also showed interest in other bands, including 800 MHz, 2500 MHz, and 26 GHz.Interestingly, there was no demand reported for the 3300 MHz band, which is considered ideal for 5G signals.The government is offering spectrum worth Rs 96,317.65 crore in this auction, aiming to raise approximately Rs 10,000 crore. However, brokerage reports estimate the final amount could range between Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 16,600 crore. However, this amount is significantly lower than the record Rs 1.5 lakh crore raised in the 2022 auction.The spectrum acquired in this auction will be valid for 20 years, with options for sharing, trading, leasing, and surrendering after 10 years. Telecom operators can choose to pay the full amount upfront or opt for deferred payments with a higher interest rate of 8.65% compared to the previous auction.Bharti Airtel is expected to be the biggest spender in this auction, with analysts predicting an outlay of around Rs 10,400 crore. The company is reportedly looking to firm up its sub-1GHz holdings and increase its share in the 1800-MHz and 2300-MHz bands. Airtel is also facing spectrum renewals in six circles: Assam, Bihar, J&K, Orissa, UP East, and West Bengal.The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) stated that the auction would catalyze the rapid rollout of 5G services, leading to improved coverage and connectivity.Lt. Gen. Dr. S.P. Kochhar, Director General of COAI, stated, ""By bridging the digital divide, the 5G spectrum auctions will ensure that even the most remote areas of our country gain access to high-speed internet, thereby fostering greater economic opportunities and social advancement.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Original return date

Two Nasa astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are still orbiting the earth aboard the International Space Station , nearly two weeks past their scheduled return date.Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which faced numerous postponements prior to its launch on June 5, encountered thruster problems during its journey to the ISS.The delay is due to a series of helium leaks detected on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft , which transported them to the ISS on its inaugural crewed mission.Boeing and Nasa engineers are diligently working to resolve the issue and ensure the safe return of the astronauts. According to Nasa, the spacecraft is ""performing well in orbit while docked to the space station.""Nasa said that astronauts Wilmore and Williams have the ability to undock from the space station and return to Earth whenever necessary they are not ""stranded"", they are just being kept in orbit passed their planned return to ""allow mission teams time to review propulsion system data.""""We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,"" Nasa's Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said in a statement reported by Newsweek.""We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance,"" he added.Sunita Williams is an accomplished Nasa astronaut and a distinguished US Navy officer, and has been selected to serve as the co-pilot alongside Wilmore on the Starliner mission.In 1987, Williams began her career as a junior commissioned officer in the Navy. Following a six-month assignment at the Naval Coastal System Command, she successfully completed her training and earned the designation of Basic Diving Officer.Sunita Williams became the first woman to pilot a test spacecraft on its maiden flight to space. Williams, an astronaut who previously held the record for the highest number of spacewalks completed by a woman.She achieved a total of seven spacewalks throughout her career. In addition, Williams set another record by accumulating 50 hours and 40 minutes of spacewalk time, the most ever recorded by a female astronaut.Williams has participated in multiple missions to the International Space Station (ISS), in 2012 she was named the commander of the space station, becoming only the second woman to do so.The 58-year-old has earlier spent 322 days in space, and held a record for maximum hours of spacewalk by a woman. This is her third space flight, others being in 2006 and 2012.In a candid talk, Sunita also shared her journey of becoming an astronaut. ""I did not dream of becoming an astronaut. I loved animals and wanted to be a veterinarian. I was a good swimmer, too, and my brother talked me into going to the Naval Academy. I was a helicopter pilot and until my mid-twenties didn't realize that I could become an astronaut.""Sunita's voice filled up with emotion when she was asked about her close friend and colleague Kalpana Chawla. Her death in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster did not make Sunita nervous.""We had trained a lot and I had confidence in the team that was rebuilding the system. I had to continue Kalpana's dream,"" she said.Sunita's passion for adventure and the outdoors finally got her thinking about a career as astronaut. As students listened in awe, she gave them a piece of advice. ""Find something that you like doing and you will do it well. Put your mind to it.""Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore is an experienced Nasa astronaut and former US Navy test pilot. Nasa selected Wilmore aged 61, to join their astronaut program back in 2000.Originally from Tennessee, Wilmore currently resides in Houston.He has participated in two prior space missions, one of which involved piloting the Space Shuttle to the ISS in 2009, during the final stages of the shuttle program before its retirement.In 2000, Barry was picked to join Nasa's astronaut corps. Over the course of his two prior space missions, he has spent a combined total of 167 days in orbit.The initial plan for Wilmore and Williams was to make their way back to Earth aboard the Starliner on June 22. However, this date was later postponed to June 26, and then pushed back on Friday to a date that has not yet been determined.Mark Nappi, who serves as the vice president and program manager of the Commercial Crew Program for Boeing said that despite the setbacks, ""Wilmore and Williams remain 'overwhelmingly positive.""The Starliner spacecraft has the capability to stay connected to the space station for a maximum duration of 45 days.","Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are still orbiting the earth aboard the International Space Station.

Emmanuel Macron: Extreme opposition parties would cause civil war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-extreme-opposition-parties-would-cause-civil-war/articleshow/111246771.cms,"President Emmanuel Macron said the agendas of the far-right and far-left blocs in France’s upcoming legislative elections pit the country’s people against each other, going so far as to say that “extreme” parties could spark a “civil war.”The far-right National Rally ’s plan to deal with crime and insecurity “refers to people of a religion or an origin — it divides and it leads to civil war,” Macron said in an interview with a Génération Do It Yourself podcast aired Monday evening. The far-left France Unbowed that’s part of a hastily cobbled alliance is also peddling sectarian politics that would provoke similar hostilities, he said.The increasingly strident comments from Macron’s camp reflect a last-ditch attempt to woo voters as his centrist party trails behind the National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front in the polls with less than a week before the first round of voting. One pollster even suggested the far-right party could clinch an absolute majority in the National Assembly, though France’s two-round voting system makes forecasting tricky.In the days after Macron’s surprise call for an election to renew the National Assembly two weeks ago, his allies have taken to the air waves to speak of the dangers of the far right or the far left coming into power. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said a government by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally would harm “civil peace,” without providing any evidence to support his claim. He has also warned that both the far-right and the left would be disastrous for the economy.Opposition parties have accused Macron and his allies of fear mongering to spook voters. The head of the French Unbowed party, Jean-Luc Melenchon, on Monday rejected Macron’s “civil war” comment, saying it’s the president who tends to divide the French.“He’s always around when it comes to setting fires,” he said, alluding to recent political tensions in France’s overseas territory of New Caledonia.Comments from Macron’s party have done little to halt the rise of the National Rally and the alliance of the left in the polls. Le Pen’s party would win the first round of the French legislative election with 36%, according to latest Ifop-Fiducial poll of voting intentions published Monday. The alliance of left-wing parties would get 29.5%, while Macron’s group would get 20.5%.Investors dumped French assets in the days after Macron’s call for the vote, fretting over how a new government could further stretch the country’s budget deficit. The turmoil pushed the risk premium on French bonds versus German ones to the highest since 2012 last week, though that spread narrowed slightly on Monday.Le Pen's Party Is Still in Front, With Leftist Alliance Second | French far right leads ahead of first round of voting June 30The first round of the election is set for June 30, with the second round slated for July 7. Macron, who called for the vote after his party was crushed in the European Parliament election, seemed to acknowledge in the podcast that his group may face a loss in the ballot.National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has been working to assuage voters that he can be trusted overseeing the country’s economy.On Monday, he outlined the party’s plan to pay for a reduction in sales tax on energy and fuel — – which would cost €7 billion ($7.5 billion) a year – by cutting France’s contribution to the EU budget, closing tax advantages for shipping firms and boosting levies on the profits of energy companies.The National Rally “is the only movement to implement immediately and reasonably the expectations of French people. In three words: we are ready,” he said. “We aim to bring the country back to budgetary reason.”Le Pen’s Party Seen Winning Biggest Share of Seats | Projected number of lawmakers in French National AssemblyMost pollsters predict that the National Rally will form the largest group in the National Assembly but fall short of the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority. The latest survey by Odoxa predicts the party will get between 250 to 300 seats.This scenario — where National Rally wins the most seats in the legislature but falls short of an absolute majority — would likely inflict gridlock on the lower house, meaning any ambitious legislation or reform would be difficult to pass.Get Bloomberg’s coverage of the French election in your inbox by signing up to our newsletter, The Paris Edition.

Going after Biden

WASHINGTON: Mass expulsions? Political revenge? World peace? A new golden age? As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, America is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.In a series of interviews and campaign rallies, the republican has offered some clues.Here are Trump's plans for the United States and the world, as set out by the candidate himself.President Joe Biden 's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history on his first day in office.""We're going to get them out as fast as we can,"" he has said, accusing undocumented migrants of ""poisoning the blood of our country.""The 78-year-old, known for his unfinished border wall project, has said he would be happy to ""use the military"" as part of the effort and would open detention camps to process targets for expulsion.""On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship,"" he said in a campaign video.He has confirmed he also plans to reinstate his ban on entries from several Muslim-majority countries, as a means of ""keeping terrorists the hell out of our country.""Trump has been saying for months he could end the war in Ukraine in ""24 hours,"" without explaining how.Critics suggest his plan would involve pressuring Kyiv to cede territory illegally occupied by Russia in both 2014 and 2022.""I will have that settled prior to taking the White House,"" he told a rally in the midwestern city of Detroit recently. ""As president-elect, I will have that settled.""The ex-president is highly critical of Washington's shipments of weapons worth billions of dollars to Kyiv, and of the funding requests from Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy .""It never stops"", he told the Michigan crowd.Asked in a town hall with Fox News whether he would remain committed to Nato during a second term, he replied: ""Depends if they treat us properly.""Trump envisages tariffs of ""more than 10 percent"" on all imports.US companies and eventually their customers pay for import tariffs, not the companies exporting the goods.Trump insists that the revenue collected will finance a ""middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut.""Having waged a fierce trade war with China during his first term, he also plans to revoke the Asian giant's ""most favored nation"" status, granted to promote trade.Trump claims he will ""stop inflation by stopping the invasion,"" arguing that his immigration crackdown will reduce housing costs and other expenses.Trump never misses an opportunity to point out that it is partly thanks to him and his three conservative supreme court appointments that abortion rights have been considerably weakened in the United States.But he is more ambiguous about the future of access to reproductive health care.Insisting it should be an issue for the individual states, the republican has balked at pushing a nationwide abortion ban, a commitment that would win him support from the religious right.""You must follow your heart on this issue but remember, you must also win elections,"" he said in April.Trump slammed the door on the 2015 Paris climate accords during his first term.If reelected, he said at a rally earlier this month, he ""will stop Biden's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam"" a reference to the funding committed by his successor to mitigating climate change.""I will repeal crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will 'drill, baby, drill,'"" Trump told supporters in Wisconsin, using an old republican slogan.""Energy costs will come down very quickly,"" he vowed. ""In many cases we'll be cutting your energy costs in half.""Trump, who was convicted in May of felony business fraud and faces three further indictments, has baselessly and repeatedly claimed his various prosecutions are a political witch hunt by democrats.The republican has pledged to ""appoint a real special 'prosecutor' to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the USA, Joe Biden.""No investigation has produced evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden.He also said he was ""absolutely"" ready to pardon all the Trump supporters convicted of storming the US capitol in Washington to prevent Congress from certifying the republican's 2020 presidential election defeat to Biden.","President Joe Biden's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history. The 78-year- old, known for his unfinished border wall project, has said he would be happy to ""use the military"" as part of the effort.

As reported by the New York Post, this 2-2-2 involves doing three things every day -- drinking two big bottles of water, eating two servings each of fruits and vegetables and taking two walks -- in addition to the regular routine.This new viral method does not come with any quantity of water and fruit and vegetables as water intake will depend on activity level, weather, overall health etc. Jenna Rizzo said that these two serving of fruits and vegetables are to supplement one's eating plan clarifying that she was not suggesting to eat only two servings of fruits and vegetables in a day.“And if you have time to exercise on top of that and want to go for it, these will simply be our daily minimum requirements,” Rizzo said. “Your skin’s gonna be clear, you’re gonna have more energy, you’re gonna be sleeping better and you’ll probably already be down a few pounds,” she said.Dr Ian K Smith is the creator of this plan designed to reboot your metabolism. This six-week program is a little complex. The first 2 weeks focus on two different types of meals: fatty meals and carb-heavy meals. The second 2 are non-food related like checking weight weekly and not daily and introspective journaling. The third 2 is for bodyweight exercise or high intensity interval workouts.","Georgia health coach made her 2-2-2 weight loss method famous on TikTok.

Pak government's borrowings exceed two previous fiscal years combined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-governments-borrowings-exceed-two-previous-fiscal-years-combined/articleshow/111251833.cms,"KARACHI: In a fiscal year marred by unprecedented borrowing and soaring debt servicing costs, the Pakistani government faces substantial financial challenges as it navigates through economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, Dawn reported.""The government's borrowings in the first 11 months of the outgoing fiscal year have exceeded the combined figure of the two preceding fiscal years,"" revealed economic data, emphasising the magnitude of financial commitments.This hefty borrowing, amounting to PKR 7.39 trillion from July 2023 to June 7, 2024, surpasses the government's collective borrowings of PKR 7.16 trillion in the previous two fiscal years (FY23 and FY22).Bankers speculate that total borrowings for FY24 could reach PKR 8 trillion by June 30, driven by high spending necessitated by slashed development budgets in favour of meeting other expenses.The impact of this extensive borrowing is profound, constraining the government's ability to allocate funds towards critical development projects. Instead, a significant portion of tax revenues is earmarked for debt servicing, a trend expected to escalate in the upcoming fiscal year, as reported by Dawn.""The government would spend PKR 7.21 trillion on domestic debt servicing and an additional PKR 1.04 trillion on foreign debt servicing, taking the total to PKR 8.25 trillion,"" according to the budget document for FY2023-24. This figure is set to rise further in FY25, with allocations totalling PKR 9.77 trillion for debt servicing alone.Amid projections of increased revenue generation, economic experts remain skeptical about achieving ambitious tax collection targets. ""Economy experts believe that the government will not achieve the PKR 12.97 trillion tax collection target set for FY25,"" citing concerns over past targets being missed, including the PKR 9.41 trillion target for FY24.Critically, the high interest rates, recently reduced but still hovering around 20.5 per cent, have polarized opinions within the business community. ""The business community also finds this rate high and is demanding that it be brought down close to the inflation rate,"" as inflation levels stood at 11.8 per cent in May, prompting calls for interest rates to be lowered to 13-14 per cent.""This excessive borrowing practically makes it impossible for the government to spend money on development projects,"" lamented a banker, highlighting the imbalance between public sector investments and private sector participation, Dawn reported.","Pakistani government faces substantial financial challenges as it navigates through economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures.

Nearly 450 Indian Sikh are currently in Pakistan to observe the death anniversary of Ranjit Singh who ruled Punjab in the 19th century and was the first maharaja of Sikh empire.

Lahore's Fakir Khana Museum director Fakir Syed Saifuddin spearheaded the project to repair, rebuild, and restructure the statue that had incurred nearly 80% damage.

""It was out of love and respect for Ranjit Singh that I undertook this project. The restoration cost around Rs 27 lakh and the work spanned over a year. The statue was donated for its installation in Gurdwara Darbar Sahib complex,"" Saifuddin, a fifth generation descendant of Fakir Sayed Azizudin who was chief secretary and foreign minister in Ranjit Singh's govt said. His brothers Fakir Syed Imamudin and Fakir Syed Noorudin were acting governor, Amritsar, and governor, Lahore, respectively.

Indus Water Treaty Talks: Pakistani Delegation Visits Jammu for Bilateral Discussions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-delegation-arrives-in-jammu-for-indus-water-treaty-talks/articleshow/111211635.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Pakistani delegation arrived in Jammu on Sunday evening as part of ongoing discussions concerning the 1960 Indus Water Treaty (IWT). The team is scheduled to visit various dam sites in the region over the next few days. This visit marks is a step towards bilateral efforts to address and manage water resources shared by India and Pakistan under the treaty, which governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries. The delegation's itinerary includes inspections of key dam projects to facilitate discussions on water management and treaty compliance.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed by then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Pakistan President Ayub Khan in 1960, establishes a framework for cooperation and information exchange on the use of the Indus River system. The treaty is overseen by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral body with commissioners from both countries tasked with implementing and managing treaty provisions, and resolving any questions, differences, or disputes that may arise.The PIC, which includes Indus Commissioners from India and Pakistan, has been a crucial platform for technical discussions and treaty compliance. Despite the treaty's framework, India and Pakistan have faced ongoing disagreements over hydroelectric projects. Pakistan has raised objections to India's construction of the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants, arguing they violate treaty provisions. India, however, maintains that the projects are compliant with the treaty's guidelines and asserts its right to develop them.Efforts to resolve these disputes have been ongoing, with the World Bank encouraging both nations to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In 2015, Pakistan requested the appointment of a Neutral Expert to review its technical objections to India's projects but later sought arbitration in 2016. Despite five meetings of the PIC from 2017 to 2022, Pakistan has refrained from discussing the issue, complicating efforts to reach a consensus.The arrival of the Pakistani delegation signals a continued commitment to dialogue and cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, with the upcoming site visits expected to further discussions on water management and treaty implementation.",Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu as part of ongoing discussions concerning Indus Water Treaty.

Chinese 'ultra set' telecom gear devices used by Pakistan's army seized from terrorists in J&K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/chinese-ultra-set-telecom-gear-devices-used-by-pakistans-army-seized-from-terrorists-in-jk/articleshow/111206076.cms,"NEW DELHI: Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment , known as ' Ultra Set ,' which were used by terror groups, officials said. This sophisticated gear, initially meant for the Pakistan army, has found its way into the hands of terrorists, raising serious concerns over undetected infiltrations from across the Line of Control (LoC). Authorities believe these terrorists might be residing in the outskirts of cities and villages in the region.The 'Ultra Set' devices, found during a gunfight in the Sindarah top area of Surankote in Poonch district and in Sopore's Check Mohalla Nowpora in Baramulla district, were seized after confrontations last year and earlier this year. Four foreign terrorists were killed in Surankote, while two were eliminated in Sopore. These specialized handsets, customized by Chinese companies for the Pakistan army, combine cell-phone capabilities with unique radio equipment that bypasses traditional mobile technologies like GSM or CDMA.Officials indicated that the 'Ultra Set' devices operate on radio waves for message transmission and reception, each linked to a control station across the border. The messages are compressed and transmitted via Chinese satellites to a master server in Pakistan. The discovery of such advanced communication tools has heightened fears of state-sponsored support for terrorism.“This is yet another help being extended by China to its key ally Pakistan,” officials said, noting that China has been actively enhancing Pakistan's defense capabilities along the LoC. This support includes the construction of steelhead bunkers, the provision of unmanned aerial vehicles, and the installation of encrypted communication towers, alongside laying underground fiber cables.Additionally, Chinese radar systems, such as those of the ""JY"" and ""HGR"" series, have been deployed to improve target detection along the LoC. Advanced weaponry like the SH-15 truck-mounted howitzer has also been observed in the region. These developments are seen as part of China’s strategic interests in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), particularly in connection with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).While there has been no direct sighting of senior People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials at forward posts, intercepted communications suggest that Chinese troops and engineers have been involved in infrastructure development in PoK. This includes the construction of underground bunkers and tunnels in the Leepa Valley, supporting a direct route between Gwadar Port in Pakistan and China's Xinjiang province through the Karakoram Highway.(With agency inputs)","Encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir led to the seizure of highly encrypted Chinese telecom equipment.

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives - spanning across areas like connectivity, health, trade, energy, defence and maritime cooperation - as PM Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Sheikh Hasina for the first state visit after the formation of the new NDA government. Among the new initiatives was an announcement by Modi after the meeting that India will soon send a technical team to Bangladesh for management and conservation of the Teesta river inside Bangladesh.The announcement is significant as it comes amid efforts by China to convince Dhaka to allow it to develop the Teesta basin. Aware of India’s reservations about China’s role, Bangladesh has maintained it will consider “geopolitical issues” before going ahead with the project, which will apparently cost $ 1 billion.Hasina is expected to soon visit China, a country Dhaka - in a fine balancing act - continues to have strong economic ties with for its development needs. “As part of our development cooperation, we will also undertake conservation and management of Teesta River inside Bangladesh with Indian assistance within a mutually agreed timeframe,” said a joint statement, in which the leaders announced a shared vision for commerce, connectivity and collaboration.Sharing of Teesta waters has remained a long outstanding issue between the countries, after opposition from West Bengal prevented them from signing a water-sharing agreement finalised during the UPA government. India’s technical team is expected to first examine if there’s any need for a reservoir to be built, something which the Chinese have reportedly suggested. For India, it’s important that Bangladesh remains mindful of Indian security concerns while pursuing economic projects with Beijing.The leaders also welcomed formation of a Joint Technical Committee to initiate discussions for the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. They pledged to intensify cooperation in border management, counterterrorism and against radicalisation, while agreeing to start talks for a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).“We have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas. We have managed to restore in the past 10 years connectivity that was there before 1965. We will now focus on energy and digital connectivity. We will soon launch CEPA negotiations to take our economic cooperation to new heights,” said Modi.There was focus on long-term defence cooperation as well as India and Bangladesh signed an MoU for cooperation concerning military education in the field of strategic and operational studies. For modernization of the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the leaders said they will explore defence industrial cooperation, while ramping up military engagements in the form of exercises, training and capability development.The 2 countries announced signing of agreements for digital and green partnerships, as also a significant initiative by India to provide e- visa for medical patients from Bangladesh. “To facilitate easier cross-border travel and as a supportive gesture to the friendly people of Bangladesh, India will extend e-Medical Visa facility to people from Bangladesh travelling to India for medical treatment,” said the joint statement, adding India will also help Dhaka with supply of essential commodities.Other major announcements included new Assistant High Commission of India in Rangpur in Bangladesh, train service between Rajshahi and Kolkata and bus service between Chittagong and Kolkata. To promote sub-regional connectivity, government said India will extend transit facilities for movement of Bangladesh goods to Nepal and Bhutan through railway network.India is also looking at early operationalization of two Special Economic Zones (SEZs) offered by Bangladesh to India in Mongla and Mirsharai and to opening of new border-haats. The 2 countries also signed an MoU to enhance railway connectivity. The joint statement also said they will pursue collaboration in frontier technologies, including civil nuclear, oceanography and space technology. “To this end, we will partner in joint development of a small satellite for Bangladesh and its launch using Indian launch vehicle,” it said.",India and Bangladesh signed 10 agreements/ MoUs and announced over a dozen other initiatives.
