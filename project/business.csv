'Closest ally': Maldivian President Muizzu thanks India for economic support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-president-thanks-india-china-for-help-to-boost-economy/articleshow/112089601.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu expressed gratitude towards India for its support in easing debt repayment obligations and voiced optimism and stronger bilateral ties, possibly through a future free trade agreement.President Muizzu made these remarks during the official Independence Day function in the Maldives, celebrating eight months of 'diplomatic success,' as reported by the Maldives President Office.President Muizzu thanked India and China for their assistance in easing the Maldives' debt burden, which he said has allowed the country to maintain its economic sovereignty. He highlighted the ongoing negotiations for currency swap agreements with both New Delhi and Beijing as part of efforts to address local shortages of US dollars.""The Maldives government is negotiating currency swap agreements with both New Delhi and Beijing,"" said President Muizzu.Muizzu also disclosed that the Maldives is in the process of negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom and expressed hope to establish a similar agreement with India. This comes after a period of strained relations between the Maldives and India, which led to a diplomatic row.The Maldivian President recently attended the oath ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took office for a third consecutive term. Earlier this year, Muizzu sought measures for debt relief on substantial loans accumulated over consecutive governments and said that India would remain the Maldives' ""closest ally.""""India will continue to remain the Maldives' closest ally...there was no question about it,"" Muizzu said.According to Maldives-based publication The Edition, by the end of last year, the Maldives owed India 6.2 billion Maldivian Rufiyaa. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier this year cautioned that the Maldives risks significant debt distress without substantial policy adjustments.Despite expressing gratitude now, President Mohamed Muizzu earlier displayed anti-India rhetoric and ran an electoral campaign under the slogan 'India Out.' His party’s main campaign promise focused on the removal of Indian troops from the Maldives. After assuming office, Muizzu has taken several actions that diverge from traditional India-Maldives relations.In a marked departure from established convention, Muizzu chose not to visit India during his first official trip abroad, opting instead for Turkey, followed by China. These visits resulted in the elevation of Maldives-China ties to a 'comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership' and the signing of about 20 agreements.Last December, the Maldives government announced it would not renew a Hydrographic Survey agreement with India. Subsequently, after Muizzu's government formally requested the withdrawal of Indian troops, New Delhi formed a High-Level Core Group to discuss the matter, completing the troop withdrawal by May this year.After the withdrawal, Maldives defence minister Ghassan Maumoon asserted that the country's defense forces were fully capable of operating three aircraft donated by India.""The country's defence forces were capable of operating the three aircraft donated by India,"" defence minister Ghassan Maumoon affirmed.Relations between New Delhi and Male soured further after three Maldivian deputy ministers made derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referencing his photographs taken during a visit to Lakshadweep. PM Modi had suggested developing the Indian island cluster as a beach tourism destination to boost domestic tourism.This incident escalated into a diplomatic dispute, leading New Delhi to summon the Maldivian envoy and lodge a strong protest. Consequently, the three deputy ministers were suspended and remain so with pay.Maldives tourism ministry data indicated a 33 percent drop in the number of Indian tourists visiting the Maldives earlier this year compared to the previous year. This decline underscores the impact of diplomatic tensions on the tourism sector.","Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu expressed gratitude towards India for its support in easing debt repayment obligations.

'Tiger's future hinges on us. It's a collective responsibility': Sachin Tendulkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigers-future-hinges-on-us-its-a-collective-responsibility-sachin-tendulkar/articleshow/112090775.cms,"In Tadoba, I had the opportunity to see three generations of tigers: Junabai, her cub Veera, and Veera's cubs. It is a wonderful feeling of pride and joy to see these majestic creatures thriving in the wild. This quiet yet powerful resurgence is a testament to India's years-old, science-based Project Tiger , which has borne remarkable results. It is a beautiful example of what the resilience of nature , powered by human intent, can achieve.India has seen around a 24% increase in its tiger population from 2018 to 2022 and is now home to 3,682 tigers. With this, India now hosts 75% of the world's tiger population.These numbers are impressive, and we owe this success to several prudent measures, including improved wildlife management , healthier prey bases, and more effective anti-poaching measures .Also, the immense contribution of the foot soldiers of the forest department who work so selflessly and devotedly under the most perilous and arduous conditions, away from family and social life, cannot be overlooked. States like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra have led the way, with significant increases in their tiger populations.What has always been imperative in tiger conservation is reducing human-wildlife conflicts. Over the past few years, measures such as the incentivised relocation of villagers from core areas have greatly reduced these conflicts. While these numbers are encouraging, we cannot let our guard down just yet.The central Indian landscape, a crucial tiger habitat, faces numerous ecological and social challenges. This region spans across Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Forests here not only support wildlife and indigenous populations but also hold valuable coal and mineral deposits. Development projects, including mining, road and railway construction, and reservoir building threaten the already fragmented landscape. If these development projects continue without appropriate measures, the central Indian Landscape could experience a significant decline in genetic diversity, estimated to be as high as 50%.The Central India Tiger Corridor Project has shown some encouraging results. This critical corridor covers around 152,000 square km across Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh, and supports about 37% of India’s tiger population. The region includes 14 protected areas. Expanding these corridors and addressing bottlenecks through groundtruthing surveys and management plans can help preserve genetic diversity and promote healthy tiger populations.Effective tiger conservation cannot occur without the support of local communities. We should continue our pursuit to empower communities to manage conflicts and participate in conservation efforts. This will be key to achieving sustainable coexistence between humans and tigers.While poaching has declined, it remains a threat. The forest departments need to continue building their technical capacity. Sustained work towards deploying modern surveillance technologies and enforcing stricter laws against wildlife crimes might help keep poachers at bay.Strong, science-based policies and effective governance are central to successful conservation, but we must continue to build on them. The tiger population depends on continued support from govt bodies, clear policy frameworks, and collaborative efforts between national and international conservation organisations.Tigers have long been revered in Indian culture. A pastoralist tribe in Maharashtra, known as the Dhangar, venerates tigers as “Waghdev” or “Waghjai”, believing they protect their sheep. Waghoba, a primeval tiger, is considered the protector of the forest and has been worshipped by several tribal communities across India for ages. It is time we learn from these tribes and respect and protect these fierce creatures as our own family.The future of India’s tigers hinges on our ability to maintain and enhance habitat connectivity, promote sustainable development, and encourage a harmonious coexistence between wildlife and human communities. This is a collective responsibility. Tigers are our pride. Let their glory never fade!

IVR Scam: Tech-savvy fraudsters use IVR to empty citizens’ accounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tech-savvy-fraudsters-use-ivr-to-empty-citizens-accounts/articleshow/112072047.cms,"AHMEDABAD: It was the shock of her life when a 65-year-old woman from Gandhinagar lost almost all of her lifetime savings of Rs 60 lakh to cybercrooks. Why? She followed instructions given to her by the automated interactive voice response (IVR) to download a ‘legal notice’ issued in her name.“The elderly woman got a call that she had got a legal notice and to know more, she should press 2 on her keypad.As soon as she clicked the digit, multiple transactions took place, emptying her bank account linked to the phone number . The woman said that she had not clicked any web links,” said a senior cyber cell official.It is the new trick of the cyber fraud trade which is used to bamboozle unsuspecting citizens by fraudsters . Identified as IVR scam , citizens get calls on pretext of law enforcement agencies, telecom companies, govt departments, courier companies or even electricity providers where the automated voice instructs the person to dial specific digits to navigate the menu.“The pressing of specific buttons activates a link that gives remote access to fraudsters. Often, the bank accounts are linked to phone numbers and users also have apps for banking. Gaining access to the same, fraudsters then transfer money to different accounts. Before a victim can realize, the money is transferred further, leaving no trace behind,” said an investigator. “While OTPs are generated for transaction verification, when the phone is under control of fraudsters, verifying it is not difficult.”Like sextortion, experts believe the IVR frauds are also automated, working independently of human intervention. The advanced AI tools are used with scripts for sectors such as banking, insurance and telecom services among others.“One of the reasons why the IVR frauds are proliferating nowadays is, it sounds more ‘genuine’ and authentic compared to someone pretending to be a representative of a firm. We request people not to take such calls, and not to press any buttons if they are not sure of the nature of the call. In some cases, the call is connected to a person posing as an official who asks the victims to download an app for remote access,” said a cyber cell official.The officials said the most common complaint from victims is that they have not shared any personal information or clicked any links. “But the advanced frauds bypass the conventional steps to gain access to the device. Prevention, as it is said often, is always better than cure. Avoid taking calls from unknown numbers and never download any links or divulge personal information on calls,” said the official.",A 65-year-old woman from Gandhinagar lost almost all of her lifetime savings of Rs 60 lakh to cybercrooks.

In absolute terms, the pending cases have increased by over 20,900 in the past five years, increasing pressure on the country's top court despite the fact that it has been functioning at full strength.In the 23 high courts across the country, case pendency increased from 46.8 lakh in 2019 to over 62 lakh in 2023, marking a rise of more than 15 lakh cases and a 33% increase.The largest pendency, however, is in subordinate courts at 4.4 crore cases till the end of 2023. Compared with 2019, when the lower judiciary had 3.2 crore cases pending, the rise in pendency is by more than 1.2 crore cases, an increase of 38%, according to the information shared by government.""There are several reasons that lead to pendency of cases in courts, which include availability of physical infrastructure and supporting court staff , complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, cooperation of stakeholders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures,"" the law minister said.The other factors that lead to delay in disposal of cases include lack of prescribed timeframe by respective courts for disposal of various kinds of cases, frequent adjournments and lack of adequate arrangement to monitor, Meghwal added.The minister admitted that lack of coordination between agencies involved in the criminal justice system often leads to pendency.

NEW DELHI: Registering a marginal increase in top scorers, 22,920 candidates scored full marks across 45 subjects in the Common University Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( CUET-UG 2024), the gateway to undergraduate courses across 283 universities in India.However, this year, as earlier announced by National Testing Agency, these top scorers scored perfect 200, while in 2022 and 2023 the agency accorded percentile scores as the papers were conducted in multiple sessions and normalisation method was employed.Bringing relief to lakhs of aspirants, NTA announced the results on Sunday evening. Of the 63 subjects, 200 is the maximum marks for 62 and the General Test paper is of 250 marks.The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520).In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200. Of the 8.2 lakh candidates who took the English test, 1,683 scored 200.Sanskrit and Punjabi were the other two languages where over 50 candidates had perfect scores. A total of 22,836 aspirants scored 100 percentile in 2023 and 21,159 scored 100 percentile in 2022.Though the number of perfect scorers increased marginally from the number of 100 percentile scorers in 2023, the competition for select programmes like commerce is set to get tougher in popular universities like Delhi University (DU). The number of aspirants scoring 100 percentile in Busi- ness Studies was 2,357 in 2023, which has increased to 8,024 this year. However, for sought after honour programmes like economics/business econom- ics, there is likely to be a de- crease in minimum eligible marks as the number of high scorers have come down by 454% from last year. Among the 8,000-plus perfect scorers in Business Studies is Khusali Nahataa from Delhi, who aspires for admission in Shri Ram College of Commerce or Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University.A student of Modern School, Barakhambha Road, she said, “I chose to study BS with a lot of mind maps and charts. I’m aiming for SRCC or LSR. I did not take any coaching and did 8-10 hours of self-study every day.” Anjali Jyoti, a student of DAV Noida, Sector 56, scored 200/200 in three (Geography, Political Science and Psychol- ogy) of the five subjects she appeared. she said, “I want to pursue BA (Political Science H) from one of the best colleg- es of DU. I relied entirely on self-study as maximum syl- labus was from Class 12 so there was no need for extra sources or coaching. Only the deleted portion needed to be covered separately.”On July 7, NTA had released provisional answer keys of CUET-UG 2024. A retest for over 1,000 candidates whose grievances were found genuine by the agency was conducted on July 19. The delay in CUET-UG results comes amid a row over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including in NEET-UG and UGC-NET.Originally, CUET results were scheduled to be released on June 30 but NTA delayed it, grappling with paper leak allegations involving NEETUG, UGC-NET and CSIRUGC-NET. CUET-UG, conducted in hybrid mode for the first time across the country, was cancelled in Delhi a night before the scheduled exam over “logistical reasons”. The exam was conducted in the national capital later.NTA had earlier an- nounced that the third edition of CUET-UG would be com- pleted in seven days and there would be no normalisation of scores as all exams would be conducted in a single shift.For 15 subjects, the tests were in pen-paper mode and for the other 48, the exam was held in CBT mode. Over 13.4 lakh candidates registered for the test for admission to undergraduate courses in 261 central, state, deemed and private universities this year.In the first edition of the exam in 2022, the test was plagued by technical glitches. Also, as a result of tests for a subject being conducted over multiple shifts, the scores had to be normalised during announcement of results.","The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520) In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200.

Centre zeroes in on 12 spots for new industrial hubs along freight corridors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-zeroes-in-on-12-spots-for-new-industrial-hubs-along-freight-corridors/articleshow/112089672.cms,"NEW DELHI: Gaya, Koparthy and Orvakal may have hogged the limelight due to the focus on packages for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh in the Union budget, but others, including those in opposition-governed states , are part of the Centre's latest push to create new industrial hubs .From Punjab and Haryana to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Telangana and Maharashtra, government has identified 12 locations for new industrial cities along freight and highway corridors, Rajesh Kumar Singh, secretary for industrial promotion and internal trade, told TOI.Government has come under attack from opposition parties for ""favouring"" Bihar and Andhra, with JDU and TDP as BJP's coalition partners and ignoring the interests of others - a charge that has been denied by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.""We will be seeking cabinet clearance for them soon. We are looking at an investment of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore for creating trunk infrastructure and will then offer plots to companies,"" Singh said, adding that the model is the same as was followed in earlier cases. While Dholera (Gujarat), Vikram Udyogpuri (MP), Shendra Bidkin (Maharashtra) and Dadri had been taken up in the first phase when the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor was conceived 15 years ago, similar nodes are coming up in Krishnapatnam (Andhra), Tumakuru (Karnataka), Nangal Chaudhary (Haryana) and Greater Noida (UP).Typically, these projects take 10-15 years to be fully developed, including allotment of land, but Singh said that in several new cases, things will move quickly as they are already around large cities.But from the initial phase when Dholera and Shendra Bidkin were sought to be developed as completely new cities, the newer projects are seen to be on a smaller scale, focusing on creating logistics hubs or industrial clusters.Some of the newer projects will be along the Amritsar-Kolkata industrial corridor, which is running woefully behind schedule given that land was not acquired by the West Bengal government.Singh also said that government intends to correct the inverted duty structure for sectors such as leather and textiles and his department will take up the issue with the revenue department, which handles the import duty. Inverted duty refers to the duty structure where finished products attract lower duty than inputs and raw material, creating complications for manufacturers.In the budget, Sitharaman has made an attempt to revise some of the tariffs with inputs sought for further changes. Singh said industry consultations on the issue will be held soon.He also said that the abolition of angel tax will boost the startup ecosystem, by helping with funding, and also support foreign direct investment flows into the country. Department for industrial promotion and internal trade is also undertaking a review of the FDI norms and procedures, and Singh said the idea is to ensure that the approvals, wherever required, come quickly.","Gaya, Koparthy and Orvakal may have hogged the limelight due to the focus on packages for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh in the Union budget.

""Over the past 24 years, I've been seeing every day a constant battle over how fundamental freedoms and fundamental constitutional values such as equality are being chipped away , not brick by brick, but by infinitely small proportions every time you face injustice,"" he said.Delivering the keynote address at ""Is There Hope For Equality Law?"" event, organised by National Law School of India University at Bangalore International Centre, the CJI reflected on men manually cleaning drains in Delhi.The CJI questioned the true freedom of these people. ""Freedom from having to manually clean waste has a deep and historical context rooted in caste in our society. In this case, freedom is inextricably rooted in the concept of equality. An unequal society implies an unfree society because the lower unequals are always unfree from the higher unequals,"" he said.Despite the widespread support for equality and anti-discrimination laws, he questioned why prejudice and discrimination still persist. Citing Nobel laureate Amartya Sen's work on intersecting identities, the CJI underscored the importance of recognising multiple social categories such as class, caste, gender, ability, sexuality and religion, which intersect to produce unique experiences of discrimination and marginalisation.""By considering inequality through a single-axis lens, we risk overlooking the complex experiences of individuals with multiple marginalised identities and inadvertently prioritise the voices of the more privileged within marginalised groups,"" Justice Chandrachud said. The CJI concluded by advocating for contextual ""comparativism"" and rich dialogues between legal systems to strengthen the pursuit of equality.","CJI D Y Chandrachud expressed concern over gradual erosion of fundamental freedoms and constitutional values such as equality.

New technique to extract alcohol from agricultural waste promises less reliance on imports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-technique-to-extract-alcohol-from-agricultural-waste-promises-less-reliance-on-imports/articleshow/112088375.cms,"RUDRAPUR: Scientists at Pantnagar University in Udham Singh Nagar district developed a technique to extract 90% alcohol from agricultural waste , reducing India's reliance on imported alcohol, mainly from China. This innovation, led by researcher Mohammad Aziz under the guidance of professors MGH Zaidi and Sameena Mehtab from College of Basic Sciences & Humanities, promises to revolutionise alcohol production in the country.Traditionally, in India, alcohol is produced mainly from sugarcane which yields only 6-8% alcohol, necessitating imports from China.The research into the new technique will be published in the Scientific Reports journal by Nature, and a patent is being filed. Mehtab and Aziz said India produced 230 crore tonnes of agricultural waste in 2021 and 750 tonnes in 2023. This biomass, containing 70-90% sugar polymers (cellulose), is suitable for bioethanol (alcohol) production.Despite abundant biomass, India produces only about 15% of its bioethanol consumption, using only edible sugar. China developed bioethanol-from-biomass technology long ago but has not shared it. Most countries rely on fermentation technology for bioethanol production . In traditional fermentation, cellulose is extracted from biomass, fermented with enzymes to produce sugar, vapourised, isolated, and fermented again to produce 6-8% alcohol. The new technology avoids using organic solvents, which would render the alcohol unusable.The new method involves isolating cellulose from sugarcane bagasse or other high-cellulose waste, incubating it to produce fermentable sugar, and then hydrolysing it with an enzyme in a solvent. This swells the biomass and allows the enzyme to penetrate deeply. Unlike the old method, which only converts the surface carbohydrates, this technique ensures a more thorough conversion.Prof Zaidi said, ""We developed a technology to produce alcohol from agricultural waste after nearly a decade of hard work. China produces and exports alcohol from agricultural waste at low prices, while in India, alcohol from sugarcane is nearly six times more expensive due to its low yield.""","Scientists at Pantnagar University in Udham Singh Nagar district developed a technique to extract 90% alcohol from agricultural waste.

"IITs: Challenges Faced by SC, ST, and OBC Students in Joining IITs Without Reservation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/challenges-faced-by-sc-st-and-obc-students-in-joining-iits-without-reservation/articleshow/112052893.cms,"A report showed ST and SC candidates may take centuries to match general category scores at IITs without reservation, stressing the need for targeted policies.

MUMBAI: Close to four centuries—that is the timeframe it will take the Scheduled Tribe candidates of the country to match up to the scores of general category students and join an Indian Institute of Technology without any relaxation in the entry barrier. And, 367 years plus a slight improvement in their performance is the calculation for Scheduled Caste students to enter an IIT without reservation .A white paper by IIT Kanpur alumnus Dheeraj Singh looked at the historical admission data of various categories of students joining the IITs , the mean normalised scores of each, and the input parity and catch-up required in terms of years for each of them to join the top engineering colleges without any quota.Singh, who joined IIT Kanpur in 1999 as a reserved category student, had a journey fraught with challenges. Often faced with a question on why Indian students need reservation to join the IITs after about 50 years of it being introduced in the mid-1970s, he did some statistical analysis for those wanting a response. So, he scanned various JEE reports and tried to answer the question: “Is reservation going to be forever, and will the gap ever be bridged, or can we fast-track this, and what should be the speed to take?”“As students on the campus, there is a feeling of us versus them,” he recalled. “From home, I was the first to go to college; I did not take coaching. But I lost my confidence with every question like what was your JEE rank, what is your full name,” said Singh, who incidentally went on to do rather well in IIT Kanpur, missing his 10-pointer CGPA by just a mark in his first year. He closed the course with a graduation of an 8-pointer.Feeling invested, he wanted to check the gap between those who come with reservation and the ones who do not. Between 2013 and 2023, Singh normalised the median score (see box) and found the input gap of -60% to be the most glaring for ST students, followed by -51% for SC candidates.The score drop was steeper during Covid and is yet to recover. ""The JEE Advanced median scores in the SC and ST categories fell by around 30% to 40% during Covid compared to their pre-Covid levels. For OBC, the decline was around 20%. Despite a slight recovery, post-Covid scores are still below pre-Covid levels. The decline in median scores is -1.4% per year for SC and -1.3% per year for ST and -0.6% per year for OBC categories over the last 10 years.”Then, looking at the catch-up rate, Singh found that if that increases to +1% per year due to targeted policy actions, it would take around 90 to 100 years for SC and ST categories to achieve parity with general category scores. For OBC, it would take 32 years to achieve parity on JEE Advanced scores. But if the catch-up rate is slower at 0.5% per year, it would take 180 to 200 years for SC and ST categories to achieve parity with general category scores in the JEE Advanced examination.“Policymakers should be seriously worried about the process of mainstreaming SC, ST, and OBC being so slow and long drawn, and hence there should be targeted mechanisms in place to accelerate the mainstreaming process with a clearly defined goal of achieving full parity in the next 20 years,"" said Singh, who is also the founder of Global IIT Alumni Support Group.","A report showed ST and SC candidates may take centuries to match general category scores at IITs without reservation.

Sources said that students are demanding that the reporting period be postponed after Aug 15 so that they can attempt NEET-PG.","A Gujarat student achieved 705 out of 720 in NEET-UG but failed the Class 12 science board exams, scoring 352 out of 700. This academic anomaly has sparked discussions, as her NEET success doesn't fulfill medical college criteria due to poor board results. Calls for more medical seats arose due to easier exam questions boosting scores.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112078089,imgsize-17232,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112078089.jpg"

The Greek contingent, honored as the spiritual home of the Games, led the procession, followed by the Refugee team.The Indian contingent, consisting of 78 athletes and officials, made their entrance at the 84th position during the event. Leading the contingent were two iconic figures in Indian sports: PV Sindhu , a two-time Olympic medallist, and A Sharath Kamal , a legendary table tennis player, who served as the flag-bearers for their nation.The female members of the Indian contingent were elegantly attired in sarees, a traditional Indian garment. Meanwhile, the male athletes and officials wore ""kurta-payjama"" in the shades of the Indian tricolor, showcasing their national pride and unity.The boats sailed past iconic city landmarks, including the restored Notre Dame Cathedral, which was gutted by fire five years ago, the renowned Louvre Museum, and several of the Games' venues.In April 2019, the world was shocked by images of the Cathedral ablaze and the collapse of its spire.American pop superstar Lady Gaga was among the first international artists to captivate the gathered crowd. The ceremony was directed by artistic director Thomas Jolly.Amid the colorful proceedings, a mysterious torchbearer captured everyone's attention as he darted around the city and its most famous landmarks, carrying the flame.He even crossed the Seine from Ile Saint-Louis on a zip-line after the cabaret performers finished their act.Adding a touch of childlike fun to the ceremony were the world-famous Minions and the missing Mona Lisa, which was eventually found floating on the Seine.The bridges along the parade route featured dance performances for fans, who gathered at various spots after more than 200,000 free tickets were distributed in addition to the over 100,000 sold.A glimpse into the workshops of the Monnaie de Paris, where the medals for the Games are forged, was presented to honor the city's renowned craftsmanship.

Natasa Stankovic Gets Trolled For Sharing Videos of Her Happy Moments with Son in Serbia

When you picture the world's richest people in the world, the names of Mukesh Ambani, Elon Musk, Jess Bezos, Bernard Arnault & family, and Mark Zuckerberg come to the mind. But long before, any of them existed a powerful Chinese Empress Wu Zetian of Tang dynasty , boasted of wealth of around 16 trillion USD , which could overshadow combined net worth of the wealthiest people across the globe.Popularly known as Empress Wu, the richest-ever female monarch accumulated the unfathomable fortune, with her astute vision, shrewd techniques, and brutal decisions, that also included killing of her own children, it is said. While she was hailed for some of her decisions like reducing the taxes on peasants that helps in increasing agricultural productivity and thus state revenue, she also took some controversial decisions.As per one of the accounts, her power hunger and paranoia led her to kill one of her own children - her daughter - and depose her sons who were emperors before her. She, however, helped expand the Chinese empire significantly in the 15 years of her reign from 690 C.E. to 705 C.E.Wu Zetian was born in a wealthy family to a timber merchant in 624 AD in Shanxi province. Her father was close to Li Yuan, who eventually ascended to become Emperor Gaozong of Tang and this gave her an opportunity to forge close connections with the royal household.Empress Wu was deeply passionate about literature from a very early age and at the age of 14, she was appointed as a secretary in the Tang Palace, getting an opportunity to work under Emperor Taizong.Subsequently, the emperor's death led her to a Buddhist monastery which was a common practice for all the women associated with the emperor during that time. However her affair with Emperor Gaozong, the deceased emperor’s son and successor, once against brought an unexpected twist in her journey as she once again made her way back to the palace as a concubine.With her cunning ways, she soon ousted Empress Wang and ascended to the throne as an empress in the year 655. A major turning point for her was when Emperor Gaozong entrusted the empress with the governance of his empire after his health took a turn for the worse and he started having debilitating migraine-like headaches and vision loss.Thus, started a historic reign that made her the first and only woman to rule China. Well-educated, visionary, and an excellent public speaker, Empress Wu is credited with a number of welfare measures that also boosted trade like reducing taxation to re-opening of silk road to trade.(Image courtesy: Pinterest)","Wu Zetian was born in a wealthy family to a timber merchant in 624 AD in Shanxi province.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

In a dramatic act of protest , a pair of passengers took their frustration with Delta Airlines to a new level by raiding the airline’s VIP lounge after experiencing significant flight delays . Their bold antics, which included loading up on free food, emptying hand sanitizer dispensers, and more, have captured widespread attention online.A video documenting the escapade has garnered over 600,000 views on TikTok.Content creator Kyle Philippi, who posted the footage, captioned it, “POV: Delta doesn’t compensate for thousands of dollars lost from delaying our flights for days so we gonna get it back in the Sky Club. This will set them back.”The video’s timing seems to align with last week’s Microsoft outage, which led to Delta canceling thousands of flights and affecting approximately half a million passengers, according to the AP.The footage opens with Philippi and an accomplice filling their plates with an excessive array of complimentary food at Delta’s Sky Club lounge. They proceed to pour out bottles of wine, steal magazines, and squeeze all the hand sanitizer from its dispenser. The video concludes with Philippi running water in the lounge’s shower, without using it for bathing, and emptying the shampoo and soap onto the floor.Despite the clear act of defiance, the TikTok community has largely supported the duo’s actions. Comments praising Philippi and his partner have been abundant, with one user saying, “I won’t lie, pouring the wine out went hard.” Another praised, “This is the level of petty we strive for,” and a third added, “As a Sky Lounge connoisseur, I am humbled by your greatness.”Philippi responded to supporters, saying, “This is for the people,” reflecting the sentiments of those who feel wronged by the airline.The Post has reached out to Delta Airlines for a response. US regulators are currently investigating the reasons behind Delta’s prolonged recovery from the global outage, which has intensified scrutiny of the airline’s operational procedures.","A video documenting the escapade has garnered over 600,000 views on TikTok. “This is for the people,” said content creator Kyle Philippi in the comments.
