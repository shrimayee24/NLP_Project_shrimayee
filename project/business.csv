Amit Shah

asserted that there’s a positive vote in favour of

. In an interview with Diwakar and Akhilesh Singh on the eve of the fourth phase of polls, the home minister dismissed the assessment that a drop in turnout and absence of a wave could be impediments. Edited excerpts:

NDA

will cross 400 seats or was it a highly ambitious target?

Amit Shah:

How can you be so confident when you have already reached saturation point in your strongholds? You can only lose seats there and can’t gain. How can you reach the 400+ target?

Then why has BJP, which started with its agenda of development, shifted to politics of polarisation? You are talking about UCC, inheritance tax and are focused on the Congress manifesto; there is a lot of emphasis even on the contentious idea of one nation-one poll.

But you have also been harping on preference for Muslims in public procurement, tenders. You just said you will end religion-based quotas.

There is a perception that the momentum of

Ram Mandir

construction ebbed too early.

You have set a highly ambitious target from south India. You just said BJP will fetch the highest number of seats from south Indian states.

What is the basis of this

confidence

? You are still seen as a ‘Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan’ party and don’t seem to understand the sensitivities of south India and the complexities of politics there.

YSRCP and BJD supported you during the last five years in Parliament but you have been aggressive against them during the campaign.

You have also set an ambitious target for West Bengal, how realistic is your target after the debacle in the assembly polls?

You talked about Sandeshkhali but many victims (of sexual harassment) have gone back on their charges and have said they were made to lie…

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has got interim bail and there are indications that Hemant Soren may get similar relief. They are likely to get sympathy in Delhi and Jharkhand, which the BJP had swept last time.

You are calling it a request but it sounds more of a dare.

A couple of days ago, he was very generous to you that in Sept 2025, you are going to take over as PM because by then Modi would have turned 75.

But didn’t the party set 75 years as retirement age?

Coming back to Kejriwal’s case, he and many others in opposition have accused you of misusing ED and CBI to frame your opponents…

So you are confident of a sweep of the seven seats in Delhi?

You have used Sam Pitroda and Mani Shankar Aiyar as a stick to whip Congress, which says this is unfair as the two have expressed personal opinions and they don’t represent the party.

It is being said that the hidden agenda behind this ‘400 paar’ target is to have a super majority so that you can change the Constitution and scrap reservations.

You have also been accused of misusing electoral bonds to raise money for BJP… that the whole scheme was engineered to collect money for your party. After the SC scrapped the bonds, you said it was a good first step towards checking the use of black money in polls. Can we expect an improved version of electoral bonds in your third term?

So are you suggesting that there will be a new scheme if you get your third term?

You seem to imply that the use of cash in this election has gone back to pre-bond levels.

On Saturday, you said Revanth Reddy has committed a big mistake by doctoring a video of yours. You have messed with the ‘wrong person’, you told him in a public rally.

You have jabbed Rahul Gandhi for entering the Rae Bareli fray when he has already contested from Wayanad. Isn’t it his democratic right to decide which constituency he wishes to contest?

You just mentioned initiatives like Startup India and Digital India and how they have supported entrepreneurship. But the opposition is saying complexities in GST are killing enterprises and nipping entrepreneurship and have asked for a unified GST.

The opposition says mega initiatives like Digital India and Make in India were launched with much fanfare but have not achieved much.

TOI: Polls are halfway through but there seems to be no wave, which is also being presumed to be behind lower turnout.Are you still confident thatCertainly NDA is going to cross 400 seats. There are no ifs and buts. Low turnout should be a concern for the opposition , not us. I say this on the basis of my interaction with BJP workers. Maximum number of BJP supporters have cast their votes… people are not excited about the opposition, but they are about us. Both our victory margin and seats will increase. As for the absence of a wave, let me tell you I have been observing polls since 1975, since I was very young, and have been a student of political processes. It is the first time that we are seeing a positive vote of this scale, an endorsement of development. Youth everywhere are discussing schemes like Digital India, Startup India, share market growth. There is also excitement among farmers about welfare and empowerment schemes. Most importantly, there is an army of over 60 crore beneficiaries which is standing strongly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This will ensure BJP’s victory.(Interrupts and laughs) I remember you had asked me the same question in March 2019 when I said BJP was going to get 300 seats. And we indeed got 300. Let me answer where we are going to get seats. We are going to increase our tally in UP, Bengal, Odisha, Telangana, we are going to make a good start in Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. We are going to be the biggest party in south India and make impressive gains in East and the entire Coromandel belt. Elections are never about one single issue. I don’t consider one nation-one poll polarising… it’s a giant step towards electoral reforms. Recurrent polls mean financial expenditure for govt and political parties, frequent interruptions to development work. It is not in the country’s interest. UCC has been part of our manifesto since the 1950s. Moreover, it is not BJP’s issue. It was debated in the Constituent Assembly and is part of the Directive Principles of the Constitution which mandates states and Parliament to strive for the formulation of UCC. Different laws for followers of different faiths are at odds with secularism.Therefore, opposing UCC is communalism. Since you are talking about inheritance tax, it is part of Congress’s agenda. During elections, parties are required to debate each other’s manifestos and agendas. Polls are a contest of ideas and it is our duty to debate them. Had members of INDI Alliance not said that we should not talk about PoK as Pakistan has got nuclear bombs, we had no reason to discuss it. BJP is opposed to such dangerous ideas and has to tell people about its stand.Religion-based quotas are a violation of the Constitution, which only allows quota for SCs/STs and OBCs on grounds of social and educational backwardness. It is those who have implemented religion-based reservations who are guilty of communalism and appeasement. We are only explaining the constitutional position and our resolve to correct these errors.Ram temple was never a political issue for us, it represented our faith and belief. It should not be seen through a political lens. We corrected Himalayan blunders of Congress with construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and abrogation of Article 370 and people appreciate that.I reiterate that BJP will emerge with the highest combined tally of seats from Karnataka, Telangana, AP, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. BJP is expanding well in south India because people there support PM Modi’s leadership irrespective of language, even ideology.Those who say BJP does not understand South probably don’t understand us. We are people who live for Bharat and when we talk about Bharat, isn’t South also part of it? When we talk about Indian culture, we also express our respect for the culture and traditions of South and all other regions.YSRCP and BJD were never our allies. They supported us on some bills, but they also opposed us on others. Why should parties not support each other on issues that are in national interest? Do you want a Parliament where parties don’t come together for people’s issues? We also supported Congress on occasions on issues of national interest but did that make us allies of Congress.I don’t think we suffered a debacle in the assembly polls. We did hope to form the govt. But going from three seats to 77 when we had only 5% vote share and when Congress and CPM drew a blank was no mean achievement. In the last LS polls, we won 18 seats, and we will definitely improve this time. LS polls are about who is going to be the PM. People in Bengal are also voting against cut money, infiltration, appeasement and TMC’s opposition to CAA. Atrocities in Sandeshkhali have shaken women. Imagine, poor women were sexually exploited for years under the nose of a woman CM on the basis of their religion. This itself renders her ineligible to continue as CM. People of Bengal are firm on making Narendra Modi prime minister. I am sorry to say, unlike you people, we don’t have to depend on findings of surveys. We go by the response from people and I am confident of getting 30 of the 42 seats in the state; take that from me.(Interrupts) This is part of the pattern in Bengal where atrocities are committed and then victims are subjected to trauma and injustice for a second time by being forced to deny their suffering. When I was party president, I went to a family over lunch and they were made to pay a huge price for that. One member of the family was hanged. Is this democratic politics? But when people’s tolerance threshold is breached, they refuse to take it lying down. Today, it is BJP alone, which has emerged as the champion of their cause.Wait a moment. Just consider the facts. Arvind Kejriwal ji went to SC claiming that his arrest was illegal and he got rebuffed. So, during the course of hearing, he changed tack and sought release on bail only to be turned down by the court yet again. The court gave him interim bail saying you are the president of a party and have a democratic right to campaign but you have to come back to jail on June 2. He has neither been adjudged innocent nor has he been given bail. He will be back in Tihar jail on June 2. On the contrary, his claim that his arrest was illegal has been rejected. How can he play victim and gain mileage out of it? Here is a man who entered politics claiming to be a crusader against corruption, he vowed never to enter politics, but he became CM and then engaged in corruption. The man who declared that he would never live in a govt accommodation went on to build a palatial bungalow — sheesh mahal — out of people’s money. Don’t people know all this? In fact, whenever he goes out to campaign, people will be reminded of him being the mastermind of the liquor scam, the luxurious mansion that he built for him self. I have a simple request for him… please invite 15 common citizens from each of the seven Delhi Lok Sabha constituencies and let them see the opulence and luxury that you are enjoying at their cost. Can he invite even 15 journalists for a tour of his sheesh mahal?How can I challenge anybody, I can only make a request.This is a desperate attempt to mislead people… It has been made clear by me, our party president (J P Nadda), Rajnath Singh ji that Modi ji will not just complete his third term but will continue to lead us beyond that.That was applied in a particular situation, there is no such thing in our party constitution and in this election, BJP has fielded at least 10 candidates who are above 75 years. That apart, I would like to reiterate that Modi ji will complete his term and continue afterwards also.(Interrupts) Let us speak on the basis of facts. In 2014, we declared our commitment against corruption but there is no instance of agencies being misused to arrest anyone without evidence. Of the 5,155 PMLA cases registered since Modi took over, only 3% involve politicians. Leave that apart. Haven’t courts been approached in the case of each of these investigations? Why have the cases not been tossed out? Now look at my example, I was thrown into jail on the basis of fabricated charges. But I didn’t go around crying that I was a victim of vendetta, it was the court, which not only quashed the case, but also made the observation that the whole case was politically motivated.Yes. Since they (AAP) are in an opportunistic alliance with Congress, their erstwhile sworn rival, it is possible that in a couple of seats margins will be different but ‘lotus’ will bloom in all seven.The two gentlemen are parked in the garage and are wheeled out at election time to advance Congress’s agenda. Political parties are entitled to have their opinions no matter how controversial but they should have the courage to spell them out. We express our viewpoint freely and boldly but they do so by stealth. Aiyar and Pitroda are their stealth missiles. Both are useful for their politics of deception. Congress tries to distance itself from their remarks whenever it suits it and stages a show of taking action against them when things go awry. I have lost count of the times Aiyar was suspended and then rehabilitated with full honour. Pitroda’s remarks dividing people on the basis of facial features are reflective of the Congress mindset, which believes that India is just a collective of different ethnicities who have somehow been packed together. What they don’t recognise and appreciate is the emotional and cultural bonds which have integrated us for thousands of years. We appreciate the diversity and are also aware of the civilisational unity of this land. Also, Aiyar only articulated the Congress’s view that PoK be considered part of Pakistan. They are scared of Pakistan.Nothing can be more ridiculous and I am surprised you are putting this question to me. We had the numbers to change the Constitution for the past 10 years. We have fulfilled all our commitments: Article 370, CAA, UCC, triple talaq, enacted laws for economic reforms and for radical changes. If abolition of reservation was on our agenda, we would have done that by now using the same numbers. You don’t need 400 seats to amend the Constitution. We are not a party with a hidden agenda. The opposition is lying and misleading. On the contrary, it is they who have violated the Constitution by implementing religion-based quota… they have stolen from the share of SCs/STs/OBCs by implementing religion-based quota for Muslims.You repeated only half the accusation. Rahul Gandhi has, in fact, called the bonds the world’s biggest extortion scheme. Let me answer. We got Rs 6,000 crore through bonds and Congress got Rs 1,400 crore. So isn’t Rahul Gandhi’s allegation an admission, going by his own charge, that he also extorted Rs 1,400 crore? Members of the INDI Alliance have received Rs 6,400 crore which is more than what BJP got. Aren’t they also guilty of extortion? Now look at it in percentage terms… BJP with 383 MPs got less than Congress with 78 MPs. By that yardstick, they have got over Rs 9,000 crore. Then if we accept Rahul Gandhi’s logic, who is the bigger extortionist? And look at the language he uses, after all, the scheme was passed by Parliament. Now come to the second part, the SC in its wisdom has cancelled it but I still maintain that we need to take steps to check the role of black money in elections. Take BJP’s case: before bonds we would get more than 80% in cash, which came down to 4% after launch of the scheme. The most ill-kept secret is that cash accounted for 90% of political funding. The bonds represented a much needed corrective. True, nobody knew who donated to whom. But this confidentiality was required because we have different political parties ruling in different states and it was essential to save donors from possible persecution for not helping one party or the other. That is why they insisted on paying in cash.What I am saying is that this is a sensitive issue which needs to be debated at length by all stakeholders like political parties and civil society. We have to find a way to stop unaccounted cash from our political process.We have to wait for the post-poll declarations by political parties.I only said I will pursue my legal remedies. If you manipulate and morph my video and my speech, am I not entitled to take legal recourse…? I think I am.It is definitely his democratic prerogative and rules also allow that. The issue here is that he didn’t disclose to people in Wayanad his intent to contest from Rae Bareli as well. He waited for polling in Wayanad to be over. And mind it, he went to Wayanad because he could foresee his defeat in Amethi. This time he is apprehensive of a setback in Wayanad and that’s why he has come back to Rae Bareli and not Amethi. He is taking people of Wayanad and Rae Bareli for granted.Since you have been echoing what our opponents say, you should not call it GST but Gabbar Singh Tax… shouldn’t you? I don’t know about the people whose lies and lines the opposition is parroting. But they are either ignorant or dishonest. GST is, globally speaking, the most successful scheme to simplify and rationalise taxes. Sixteen taxes have been clubbed into one while traders have been liberated from the trauma of having to file 16 different forms by taking the entire process online. Figures speak for themselves, GST collections have increased from Rs 60,000 crore at the time of launch to Rs 218 lakh crore in April 2024. Numbers don’t lie. Those who talk about a single tax, can there be one tax for bicycle and Mercedes? Fertiliser has 5% tax and gambling has 28% tax, should the rates for them be identical?They are blinded by their prejudice and their own lies. The success of Digital India and Make in India has been acknowledged globally. In 2023, 103 billion digital transactions worth Rs 166 trillion took place in the country. Over 46% of the world’s total digital transactions take place in India. UPI is now accepted by seven countries of the world — France, Bhutan, Oman, UAE, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Similarly, 2,74,246km-long optical fibre network that is part of the Bharat Net programme has connected 1.15 lakh gram panchayats. Since the launch of Make in India campaign in 2014 to make India a manufacturing hub, FDI has doubled. We have introduced PLI scheme in 14 sectors, resulting in new jobs and India becoming an exporter of finished products.","Amit Shah said there’s a positive vote in favour of the BJP.

'If you come and do something here...': Jaishankar on India's 'message' against terrorism after Uri and Pulwama terror attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-you-come-and-do-something-here-jaishankar-on-indias-message-against-terrorism-after-uri-and-pulwama-terror-attacks/articleshow/110097865.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a poignant reflection on India's stance against terrorism , external affairs minister S Jaishankar underscored the nation's resolute message through surgical strikes and airstrikes in response to terror attacks like those in Uri and Pulwama .Speaking at an event titled 'India's Vishwabandhu Approach to Global Relations' at Mumbai's Constitution Club, Jaishankar invoked the memory of the tragic 26/11 Mumbai attacks while highlighting the subsequent strategic actions undertaken by India.Addressing the audience, Jaishankar acknowledged the world's sympathy towards India in the aftermath of the 26/11 attacks but noted a reluctance to escalate tensions with Islamabad. He attributed this global sentiment to India's failure to effectively convey the imperative of combating terrorism as a shared global threat.""When 26/11 happened you all know what our response was or to be very frank, what our non-response was. But you also know that our response was very different in Uri and Balakot. And there was a reason. Because Uri was across the Line of Control and Balakot was across the international boundary,"" Jaishankar said addressing the event. ""So the message was, if you come and do something here, you may be across the LoC, you may be across the international boundary- we will still come and get you there,"" he added.Reflecting on India's response, Jaishankar juxtaposed the restrained approach following 26/11 with the decisive actions taken after subsequent attacks. He emphasized that India's retaliatory measures in Uri and Balakot sent a clear message that perpetrators of terrorism would not find safe havens across borders.The EAM further said that India had not lobbied the world against terrorism and couldn't make them understand that anyone can be the victim of the menace.""Now, I want you to think for a moment, about the reaction of the world. When 26/11 happened, everybody said yes very bad, we sympathize with you...but do not create tensions with Pakistan. Because we had not lobbied the world, we had not made the world understand what terrorism is, it is a danger for all...Today, it is my turn, tomorrow it will be yours,"" the EAM said.The Mumbai attacks of November 26, 2008, perpetrated by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed the lives of over 166 individuals and left hundreds injured. In response to subsequent attacks, India conducted a surgical strike in 2016 targeting terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after the Uri attack, and an airstrike in 2019 against Pakistani terror camps in Balakot following the Pulwama attack.Jaishankar lamented the lack of concerted efforts to lobby against terrorism globally, emphasizing the need to delegitimize terrorism and garner international support for decisive action.Highlighting India's evolving global stance, Jaishankar emphasized the concept of ' Vishwa Bandhu ', suggesting that a country's ability to rally international support strengthens its position in global affairs. He underscored the importance of effectively conveying India's perspective to the world, noting the stark contrast in global reactions to different instances of terrorist aggression.""By the time from 2008, we had reached 2016 actually. We did Uri (surgical strikes) and the world said the Indians did what the Indians had to do. We did Balakot (Air strikes)...- Why was it that the world was understanding about Uri and Balakot, but the world was so tense, or I would say, indifferent on 26/11 because a lot of people sympathized with us, but stopped there,"" the EAM said.""And the reason is that we had not made that effort to delegitimize terrorism, to convince the world...Being Vishwa Bandhu, if you are able to carry the world with your viewpoint, you are that much stronger, you have that ability,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Jaishankar engaged with various stakeholders in Mumbai, including investors, students, and social media influencers. Emphasizing the need for a strong and experienced government, he stressed the importance of making informed decisions to propel India towards its envisioned future.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke at an event titled 'India's Vishwabandhu Approach to Global Relations' He said India's response to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks was restrained.

Chabahar agreement: India takes major step in Central Asia with Iran port deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chabahar-agreement-india-takes-major-step-in-central-asia-with-iran-port-deal/articleshow/110090725.cms,"Why it matters

Chabahar port's strategic location on Iran's southeastern coast, close to the Pakistani border, positions it as a pivotal gateway for India’s trade ambitions, enabling direct access to Central Asia.

Located on the Gulf of Oman near the Iran-Pakistan border, it offers India a crucial trade route bypassing Pakistan.

This is particularly beneficial for trade with landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.

The agreement leverages the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-kilometer-long network connecting India, Iran, Russia, and Europe.

Bypassing Pakistan allows India to diversify its trade routes and reduce dependence on its neighbor.

Economic benefits

The deal is expected to unlock significant economic benefits for both India and Iran. India Ports Global Limited (IPGL) will invest $370 million in developing port infrastructure and equipment. This investment is expected to:

Increase cargo handling capacity at the port.

Improve efficiency and reduce transportation costs.

Facilitate trade between India, Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia.

Create new job opportunities in the region.

Between the lines

This agreement represents a deepening of ties between India and Iran, amidst shifting geopolitical landscapes.

With the US's past imposition of sanctions and the consequent stalling of the port's development, this new agreement is a clear move by both nations to assert their economic independence and strategic interests in the region.

The operationalization of Chabahar port is expected to shift regional trade dynamics significantly. It not only bypasses Pakistan but also provides a strategic route to landlocked Afghanistan and beyond. This development is part of India's broader strategy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership to enhance India's maritime capabilities and extend its trade corridors deeper into Eurasia.

What they're saying

Iran's urban development minister, Mehrdad Bazrpash, remarked during the signing, ""Chabahar... can act as a focal point in the transit development of the region. We are pleased with this agreement, and we have full trust in India.""

India’s minister of ports and shipping, Sarbananda Sonowal, noted, ""This long-term contract symbolizes the enduring trust and effective partnership between India and Iran,"" highlighting the deal as a cornerstone for future cooperative ventures.

""It will clear the pathway for bigger investments to be made in the port,"" external affairs minister S Jaishankar told reporters in Mumbai on Monday.

told reporters in Mumbai on Monday. ""Right now the port has not grown. If you don't have a long-term agreement it is difficult to invest in a port. So the very clear expectation is that part of the Chabahar that we are involved in will definitely see more investments, it will see more connectivity linkages coming out of that port,"" Jaishankar said.

""We believe today that connectivity is a big issue in that part. Chabahar will connect us with Central Asia,"" he added.

What’s next

The bottom line

India and Iran sealed a critical 10-year agreement on Monday to jointly develop and manage the Chabahar port , a move that significantly deepens their strategic and economic cooperation. The pact underscores India's intent to expand its geopolitical footprint and boost trade across the West and Central Asian regions.Under the agreement, India Ports Global Limited (IPGL) committed to investing $370 million to enhance the port's infrastructure.This includes acquiring strategic equipment and expanding the transport facilities, essential for transforming Chabahar into a dynamic regional hub for trade transit.Looking ahead, the focus will shift towards the rapid and efficient execution of the infrastructure and equipment upgrades stipulated in the agreement. Both nations anticipate that the fully operational port will act as a catalyst for increased trade flows and economic integration across the region. Moreover, this agreement is likely to spur further investments and might encourage other nations to look at Chabahar as a viable alternative to traditional trade routes.By securing this long-term agreement, India not only strengthens its ties with Iran but also strategically positions itself as a significant player in Central Asian trade. This move has potential ramifications for India’s geopolitical clout, offering it increased leverage in regional politics and trade negotiations.(With inputs from agencies)",India and Iran sealed a critical 10-year agreement on Monday to jointly develop and manage the Chabahar port.

"‘Frequent flyer’ pinched valuables from cabin bags, lands in police net",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/frequent-flyer-pinched-valuables-from-cabin-bags-lands-in-police-net/articleshow/110094773.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rajesh Kapoor (40) was a frequent flyer for a bizarre reason. According to cops, in the past one year, Kapoor took about 200 flights — 3-4 sorties in a day at times — with the sole purpose of stealing from co-passengers.His ‘frequent flyer miles’ paid off handsomely and he was able to buy a hotel in central Delhi. But his ‘miles’ finally expired when he recently targeted two people flying to the US via Delhi and allegedly took away jewellery worth lakhs of rupees, prompting the police to begin a hunt.Though Kapoor had provided forged documents and an incorrect mobile number to book the flight, they managed to track him down using technical surveillance .DCP (airport) Usha Rangnani said Kapoor meticulously planned his every move. “He would use the identity documents of his deceased brother while booking tickets. He would mostly stalk passengers of connecting flights and generally target elderly women carrying handbags, assuming they would not notice the theft immediately,” she added.According to Rangnani, Kapoor used to strike either before completion of boarding or while the aircraft was mid-air.“Exploiting the chaos of boarding, Kapoor would secretly rifle through overhead cabins, carefully assessing and stealing valuables from handbags of unsuspecting passengers who would be settling into their seats. His method, carefully timed to coincide with the distractions inherent in the boarding process, allowed him to operate undetected,” the DCP said.If the target sat at a distance, Kapoor would even request the crew members to change his seat so that he could sit near the person, she added.Kapoor had been allegedly operating since 2005. For many years, he allegedly stole from passengers in AC coaches of trains. Later, he switched to flights.Kapoor landed in the net following police complaints from two passengers in a span of two months. While a US citizen travelling on an Amritsar-Delhi Air India flight approached cops on Feb 22, a Hyderabad-Delhi passenger of an Air India flight lodged a complaint on April 11. Both said they had lost jewellery kept in their cabin bags .Cops analysed the passenger manifest of these flights and scanned footage of over 100 CCTV cameras to finally zero down on the suspect. His phone number was obtained from the airlines, but turned out to be fake. Technical surveillance revealed his original number and the location was traced to Paharganj.It was found that the suspect switched on his handset only for a brief period. His photograph was obtained from social media platforms and shown to people in Paharganj. He turned out to be the owner of a hotel in the area. A raid was conducted and Kapoor was arrested.Police said the suspect may be linked to 11 similar cases. They also arrested his associate, Sharad Jain (46), who allegedly helped him dispose of the stolen goods. “Jain is a jeweller based in Karol Bagh. He received and bought the stolen items from Kapoor,” DCP Rangnani said.","Rajesh Kapoor (40) was a frequent flyer for a bizarre reason. In the past one year, Kapoor took about 200 flights with the sole purpose of stealing from co- passengers. His ‘frequent flyer miles’ paid off handsomely and he was able to buy a hotel in central Delhi. But his ‘miles’ finally expired when he recently targeted two people flying to the US via Delhi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110094810,imgsize-28146,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110094810.jpg"

Despite graduating in humanities more than three decades ago from Arya Vidyapeeth College, Guwahati, she failed to clear a recruitment test for schoolteachers' post, for which she blames alleged unfair means adopted by past administrations while hiring.Three decades on, a govt job is the top priority for all three generations of the family.Shankari, her mother, 85-year-old Manju Bhattacharjee, and 26-year-old son, Bishal Bhattacharjee, are all agreed on this point.The Bhattacharjees have lived in an ancestral plot of land in Udaypur locality in the city's Birubari area since 1979, with Shankari working as a private tutor to run the family.""When I first voted in the 1980s, unemployment was the major issue. In the early '90s, soon after graduating, I applied for a govt job as a high school teacher but could not get it because of unfair recruitment procedures. Today, there may be more transparency in the hiring process, but my son is facing the same problem. This time I voted (on May 7) with a wish that the new govt would at least make an effort to give one govt job to every family,"" said Shankari.Bishal completed BCA (Bachelor in Computer Application) in 2019 from Pragjyotish College, Guwahati, with a first class.

One was that of a computer operator and the second the grade III job.

Nirmala Sitharaman slams Cong's 'khata khat' welfare promises,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirmala-sitharaman-slams-congs-khata-khat-welfare-promises/articleshow/110095130.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finance minister

Nirmala Sitharaman

Monday accused Congress of making ""khata khat""

poll promises

without calculating the cost of implementing those schemes.

Accusing UPA of ""fiscal short-sightedness"" and ""hidden debt"", the FM asked

Rahul Gandhi

to answer if the announcements he has made would translate into higher borrowings or higher taxes.

""How many welfare schemes would @RahulGandhi shut down to accommodate the fiscal cost of the 'khata khat' schemes?""

Last month, Rahul had announced that if voted to power, his party would transfer Rs 1 lakh in the account of one woman from every poor household in the country if they win the elections. ""The question isn't just about borrowing; it's also about applying thought on expenditure. Congress is interested in spending on short-term populist measures and there has never been a focus on long-term development,"" she said in a social media post.

Pointing to the UPA's track record,

Sitharaman

alleged that UPA govt had resorted to ""window dressing"" and did not provide a clear picture of govt finances. In contrast, she said, Modi govt has followed a transparent mechanism and ensured better delivery of service and checked leakages through initiatives such as direct benefit transfer.

""The truth is our govt's fiscal management is much better than that of the UPA despite facing Covid-19 pandemic in which substantial resources were used for relief efforts,"" the FM said.

During the pandemic, she said, govt did not follow the ""borrow, spend and even print money"" suggestion from ""luminaries"" in the opposition, some of whom are now complaining about high debt levels, a charge that the FM dismissed by dishing out data.

""A cross-country comparison reveals that India has fared relatively well and maintains a general govt debt ratio below that of FY2003... In a comparative analysis with other low and middle-income countries (LMICs), India's external debt scenario is robust.

India's share of short-term debt in the total external debt is 18.7%. This is lower than that of other LMICs like China, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam, South Africa and Bangladesh, which have higher percentages,"" Sitharaman added.","Nirmala Sitharaman accused Congress of making ""khata khat"" promises without calculating the cost of implementing those schemes.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Hush money trial: Michael Cohen's damning testimony against Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-michael-cohens-damning-testimony-against-trump/articleshow/110099765.cms,"What specific role did Donald Trump play in the hush money scheme, according to Michael Cohen?

What were the allegations that prompted the hush money payments?

How did Trump allegedly ensure these stories were suppressed?

What risks does Cohen's testimony pose to Donald Trump?

Has Trump responded to the allegations made during the trial?

What could be the political implications of this trial for Trump?

In a gripping chapter of what could shape the future of a former US President, Donald Trump 's intimate involvement in a hush money scheme has been laid bare by Michael Cohen , his former attorney and fixer. The trial, which revolves around efforts to suppress stories potentially harmful to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has seen Cohen testifying in detail about the then-candidate's direct engagement with the payment processes.These revelations underscore the legal entanglements facing Trump, as Cohen's testimony connects him to deliberate efforts to influence the election outcome by silencing accusations of past indiscretions.Cohen, once a close confidant of Trump, has transformed into a crucial adversary, delivering testimony that paints a vivid picture of Trump’s command over the secretive payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. This testimony not only highlights the lengths gone to protect Trump's campaign image but also raises significant questions about the legality of these actions. As the trial progresses, the implications of Cohen’s revelations are set to challenge the legal defenses of the former president, potentially altering his political and personal future.Here are all you need to know:Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump was ""intimately involved"" and that ""everything required Mr Trump’s sign-off."" This included direct approvals and discussions about how payments should be made to suppress damaging stories during the campaign.The payments were aimed at suppressing stories about Trump's past sexual encounters that could harm his presidential campaign in 2016. These included allegations by porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both of whom claimed to have had affairs with Trump.According to Cohen, Trump orchestrated payments to the individuals through legal and media channels. This involved setting up a shell company and arranging for payments to be made under the guise of legal fees, with Trump personally promising to reimburse Cohen for fronting the money.Cohen's testimony potentially increases Trump's legal exposure. If the jury finds Cohen credible, it could lead to convictions on several charges of falsifying business records, each linked to the payments and their cover-up as legal expenses.Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the sexual encounters with Daniels and McDougal. His defense argues that the payments were personal in nature, intended to protect his family from embarrassment, and not related to the campaign.The trial could significantly impact Trump’s image and his political future, especially as he campaigns for the presidency.

Michael Cohen testifies he and Trump worked to suppress news that would hurt 2016 campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michael-cohen-testifies-he-and-trump-worked-to-suppress-news-that-would-hurt-2016-campaign/articleshow/110098258.cms,"Cohen is frequent Trump target

NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's estranged former lawyer Michael Cohen told jurors on Monday that he conspired with the Republican presidential candidate and a tabloid publisher to suppress negative stories that could damage his 2016 campaign, as prosecutors aim to prove that Trump illegally hid a hush money payment to a porn star.Cohen said he learned from the National Enquirer in June 2016 - a month before the Republican National Convention - that former Playboy model Karen McDougal was shopping a story about a year-long affair she said she and Trump had.""Make sure it doesn't get released,"" Cohen recalled Trump saying.Trump and David Pecker, the tabloid's publisher, had already agreed that Pecker would use the newspaper to boost Trump's presidential candidacy while suppressing any negative stories that could hurt his chances, Cohen testified.Cohen described a phone call in which Pecker told Trump that the Enquirer would need to pay $150,000 to lock down McDougal's story.""To which Mr. Trump replied, 'No problem, I'll take care of it,'"" Cohen said.Pecker previously testified at the trial about his role in killing McDougal's story.Once one of Trump's most loyal lieutenants, Cohen is the prosecution's star witness as the trial enters its fifth week in New York state criminal court in Manhattan. Cohen's $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, intended to keep her from speaking publicly about a 2006 sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, is at the center of the case.Prosecutors have said the Daniels payment was part of a broader ""catch and kill"" scheme between Trump, Cohen and Pecker to pay off people, such as McDougal, with potentially negative stories about Trump in violation of campaign finance laws.When Trump was preparing to announce his campaign for president, Cohen said, Trump told him that there would be ""a lot of women coming forward.""Trump is accused of hiding the Daniels payment by reimbursing Cohen with a phony legal retainer fee that was falsely recorded in Trump's real estate company's records. Prosecutors say the altered business records covered up election-law and tax-law violations that elevate the 34 counts Trump faces from misdemeanors to felonies punishable by up to four years in prison.For nearly a decade, Cohen, 57, worked as an executive and lawyer for Trump's company and once said he would take a bullet for Trump, a Republican former president trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in this year's Nov. 5 U.S. election.Cohen said it was fair to describe his role as a fixer for Trump, testifying that he took care of ""whatever he wanted."" Rather than work as a traditional corporate lawyer, Cohen reported directly to Trump and was never part of the Trump Organization's general counsel's office.Among his duties was renegotiating bills from business partners, threatening to sue people and planting positive stories in the press, he said.Trump, he said, communicated primarily by phone or in person and never set up an email address.""He would comment that emails are like written papers, that he knows too many people who have gone down as a direct result of having emails that prosecutors can use in a case,"" Cohen said.Trump offered him a job in 2007, after Cohen presented Trump with a $100,000 bill from his then-law firm for work done for one of Trump's companies.""I was honored. I was taken by surprise, and I agreed,"" Cohen said, adding that Trump never paid the bill.Trump sat slouched in his chair with his eyes closed and lips pursed throughout Cohen's testimony, occasionally shifting his head from side to side.Cohen, who served as Trump's personal lawyer after his presidential term began in 2017, broke with him when federal prosecutors probing Trump's 2016 presidential campaign focused on Cohen. He has become one of Trump's most outspoken critics, frequently disparaging him on social media and on podcasts.On Friday, Justice Juan Merchan urged prosecutors to tell Cohen to stop making public statements about the case after defense lawyer Todd Blanche said Cohen had posted on social media while wearing a T-shirt showing Trump behind bars.Trump has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts and denies having had a sexual encounter with Daniels. He argues the case is a politically motivated attempt to interfere with his campaign.Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to violating federal campaign finance law by paying off Daniels and testified that Trump directed him to make the payment. Federal prosecutors did not charge Trump with any crime.Trump's defense lawyers have told the 12 jurors and six alternates that Cohen acted on his own when paying Daniels, seeking to distance Trump from the payments at the heart of the case.Cohen has admitted to lying under oath multiple times, providing substantial fodder for the defense to undermine his credibility.He has acknowledged lying to the U.S. Congress in 2017 about a Trump Organization real estate project in Moscow, but has since said he did so to protect Trump.He also pleaded guilty to violating tax law in 2018, but now claims he did not commit that crime.Cohen has been on the receiving end of Trump's vitriolic social media attacks, some of which the judge has said violated a gag order restricting Trump from making statements about witnesses, jurors and families of the judge and prosecutors if meant to interfere with the case.Trump has called the gag order a violation of his right to free speech and has said it is unfair to bar him from responding to attacks by witnesses such as Cohen and Daniels.Merchan has fined Trump $10,000 for repeated violations and warned the former president he could face time in jail if he keeps up his attacks.The case is widely seen as less consequential than three other criminal prosecutions Trump faces, but it is the only one certain to go to trial before the election.The other cases charge Trump with trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump pleaded not guilty to all three.","Cohen said he learned from the National Enquirer in June 2016 that former Playboy model Karen McDougal was shopping a story about a year-long affair she said she and Trump had. Trump and David Pecker, the tabloid's publisher, had already agreed that Pecker would use the newspaper to boost Trump's presidential candidacy while suppressing any negative stories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110098426,imgsize-124234,width-400,resizemode-4/110098426.jpg"
US energy panel approves rule to expand transmission of renewable power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-energy-panel-approves-rule-to-expand-transmission-of-renewable-power/articleshow/110094538.cms,"WASHINGTON: Federal energy regulators on Monday approved a long-awaited rule to make it easier to transmit renewable energy such as wind and solar power to the electric grid - a key part of President Joe Biden 's goal to eliminate carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050.The rule, under development for two years, is aimed at boosting the nation's aging power grid to meet surging demand fueled by huge data centers, electrification of vehicles and buildings, artificial intelligence and other uses.The increased demand comes as coal-fired power plants continue to be retired amid competition from natural gas, and other energy sources face increasingly strict federal pollution rules, setting up what experts say could be a crisis for electric reliability.The grid is also being tested by more frequent service disruptions during extreme weather events driven by climate change.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the new rule, 2-1, with Chairman Willie Phillips and fellow Democratic commissioner Allison Clements voting in favor. Republican Mark Christie opposed the rule, dismissing it as a gift to solar and wind power operators.The sprawling, 1,300-page rule, which addresses transmission planning and cost allocations, will enhance the country's aging grid and ensure US homes and businesses keep the lights on for decades to come, Phillips said.""This rule cannot come fast enough,'' he said at a packed commission meeting at the agency's Washington headquarters. ""Our grid cannot wait.''The US power grid ""is at a make-or-break moment'' and is being tested every day, Phillips said, citing ""phenomenal load-growth from a domestic manufacturing boom, unprecedented construction of data centers fueling an AI revolution and ever-expanding electrification"" of vehicles and buildings.At the same time, aging infrastructure, shifting economics and a range of state and federal policies are leading traditional resources to retire, he said. ""On top of all of this, extreme weather events have become the norm, and the electric grid is routinely being pushed to the brink.''At the same time, construction of high-voltage power lines declined to a record low in 2022, ""and much of that construction was simply Band-Aid fixes, rather than building a visionary grid of the future,'' Phillips said.Many power companies and Republican-led states don't want to spend money on new transmission lines or upgrades for renewable energy, creating conflicts with Democratic states that have ambitious clean-energy goals.Christie, the lone Republican on the three-member panel, said the rule ""utterly fails to protect consumers″ and ensure reliable, low-priced power for American homes and businesses.""Instead, this rule is a pretext to enact a sweeping policy agenda that Congress never passed,″ he said. The rule will likely result in ""a massive transfer of wealth from consumers to for-profit special interests,″ primarily wind and solar operators, he said.The rule is intended to streamline how power lines are sited and how costs are shared between states. It could accelerate construction of new transmission lines for wind, solar and other renewable power and add huge amounts of clean energy to the grid. Biden has set a goal of a carbon-free power sector by 2035, and net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050.To meet those targets, the US needs to more than double current regional transmission capacity and increase by five-fold the transmission lines between regions, according to an energy department study last year.Under current rules, a large queue of utility-scale renewables cannot be connected to the grid because of a lack of available transmission capacity. The rule updates the agency's planning process and seeks to determine how costs will be divided when transmission crosses state lines and goes through multiple operators of regional power grids.White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said the FERC rule adds momentum to what he called the ″historic progress″ led by Biden on clean energy. The new rule ""will improve regional transmission planning, break down barriers to grid buildout and support the delivery of more affordable and reliable power,″ Zaidi said,The new rule ""is as common-sense as it is historic,'' Clements said, adding that it calls for more advanced planning and consideration of reliability and affordability of new power sources and fosters cooperation with states.""Whether you're planning a family vacation or the nation's electricity system, planning early, taking a clear-eyed view of the options and making smart investment decisions will result in more affordable and reliable outcomes,'' she said.Christie challenged the agency action.Whether the policies promoted in the final rule ""can be described as green, purple, red or blue is irrelevant,'' Christie said. ""The point is that FERC as an independent agency has no business promoting the policies of any one party or presidential administration, especially when the effort to do so goes far beyond FERC's legal authority.''Clements responded by calling the rule ""straight down the middle'' as a legal matter.Democrats and clean-energy advocates hailed the new rule as a way to bring clean and cost-effective electricity onto the grid.""Building more multi-state transmission lines unclogs the traffic jams on America's electricity superhighways and unlocks our ability to keep up with our growing energy needs,'' said Heather O'Neill, president and CEO of Advanced Energy United, which represents renewable providers.Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, senator from New York, said the rule will build on clean-energy incentives in the landmark climate law approved by Democrats in 2022.The law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, has been ""a huge success,'' Schumer said Monday, ""but much of that success would be lost without the ability to bring power from places that generate renewable energy to communities all across the country.'' FERC's actions ""will mean more low-cost, reliable clean energy for the places that need it most,'' he said.","The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the new rule, 2-1. The rule is intended to streamline how power lines are sited and how costs are shared between states. Republican Mark Christie opposed the rule, dismissing it as a gift to solar and wind power operators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110094545,imgsize-1107467,width-400,resizemode-4/110094545.jpg"

While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” the IMF said in a staff report on Friday.Pakistan had narrowly averted a sovereign debt default last summer.The economy has now stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to 17% in April from a record 38% in May last year.IMF officials are expected to visit Pakistan this month to discuss a new loan programme. The Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition govt likely to seek at least $6 billion and request additional financing.According to the global lender, while Pakistan did “broadly achieve its narrow objectives, the challenges ahead remained uncomfortably high and would require sustained efforts to address them”.The report said that Pakistan’s fiscal and external vulnerabilities remain very high, including debt sustainability and refinancing risks. “Pakistan’s capacity to repay the IMF hinges on strong policy implementation,” the report stated.

IMF doubts Pakistan's ability to repay debts as support team arrives in Islamabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-doubts-pakistans-ability-to-repay-debts-as-support-team-arrives-in-islamabad/articleshow/110028404.cms,"NEW DELHI: International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself. The IMF 's assessment came as its support team arrived in Pakistan on Friday to discuss a new bailout package under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), following Islamabad's request.The IMF staff report, issued earlier this month, stated that ""Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund is subject to significant risks and remains critically dependent on policy implementation and timely external financing."" The report further highlighted the exceptionally high risks that could jeopardize policy implementation and erode repayment capacity and debt sustainability, including delayed adoption of reforms, high public debt and gross financing needs, low gross reserves, the State Bank of Pakistan's net FX derivative position, a decline in inflows, and sociopolitical factors.The report emphasized that restoring external viability is crucial for ensuring Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund, which depends on strong policy implementation, including external asset accumulation and exchange rate flexibility. Geopolitical instability was also mentioned as an additional source of risk, despite some reduction in uncertainty surrounding global financial conditions since the last review.According to the IMF, Pakistan requires gross financing of USD 123 billion over the next five years, with the country expected to seek USD 21 billion in fiscal year 2024-25, USD 23 billion in 2025-26, USD 22 billion in 2026-27, USD 29 billion in 2027-28, and USD 28 billion in 2028-29.Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the IMF support team will discuss the first phase of the next long-term loan programme with Pakistan's financial team, focusing on data collection from various departments and discussions on the upcoming budget for the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) with the Ministry of Finance officials. The team is expected to stay in Pakistan for over 10 days.Pakistan has decided to seek a rollover of around USD 12 billion in debt from key allies like China in the 2024-25 fiscal year to address the USD 23 billion gap in its external financing. The Finance Ministry insiders stated that USD 5 billion from Saudi Arabia, USD 3 billion from the UAE, and USD 4 billion from China will be rolled over, with estimates of further new financing from China to be included in the next financial year's budget.The country is expected to receive more than USD 1 billion from the IMF under the fresh loan programme, along with new financing from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The federal government aims to achieve budget targets before the anticipated arrival of the IMF review mission in Pakistan, with negotiations for a new loan programme expected to commence in mid-May, ahead of the budget presentation in June.Despite narrowly avoiding default last summer and experiencing some economic stabilization, Pakistan continues to face high fiscal shortfalls and stagnating growth, with the external account deficit being controlled through import control mechanisms at the expense of economic growth, which is expected to be around 2 per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","IMF has expressed serious concerns about Pakistan's ability to repay its debts, particularly to the global lender itself.

Maldives gets IMF debt warning as more Chinese loans loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/maldives-gets-imf-debt-warning-as-more-chinese-loans-loom/articleshow/110079577.cms,"MALE: The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) warned the Maldives against looming ""debt distress"" Monday, as the small but strategically placed luxury tourist destination looks set to borrow more from main creditor China.Since winning office last year, President Mohamed Muizzu has reoriented the atoll nation -- known for its upmarket beach resorts and celebrity vacationers -- away from traditional benefactor India and towards Beijing.Last month his party won parliamentary elections in a landslide after promising to build thousands of apartments, reclaim more land for urban development and upgrade airports, all with Chinese funding.Without naming the archipelago's main lender, the IMF said the Maldives remained ""at high risk of external and overall debt distress"" without ""significant policy changes"".""Uncertainty surrounding the outlook is high and risks are tilted to the downside, including from delayed fiscal consolidation and weaker growth in key sources markets for tourism,"" the IMF said in a statement.It urged the Maldives to urgently raise revenue, cut spending and reduce external borrowing to avoid a major economic crisis.The Maldives is a small nation of 1,192 tiny coral islets scattered 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator, but it strategically straddles key east-west international shipping routes.Tourism is a crucial source of foreign exchange for the country, home to white sandy beaches and secluded resorts offering Robinson Crusoe-style holidays.China has pledged more funding since last year's victory by Muizzu, who thanked the country for its ""selfless assistance"" for development funds on a state visit to Beijing shortly after he took power.Official data showed the Maldives' foreign debt reaching $4.038 billion last year, about 118 percent of gross domestic product and up nearly $250 million from 2022.As of June 2023, the Export-Import Bank of China owned 25.2 percent of the Maldives' external debt and was the country's biggest single lender, Maldives finance ministry figures showed.Debt-burdened neighbour Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in 2022 after a foreign exchange crisis that brought months of food and fuel shortages.More than 50 percent of Sri Lanka's bilateral debt is owed to China and the island nation is still struggling to restructure its borrowings with IMF assistance.Unable to service a huge Chinese loan to build a port in the south, Sri Lanka allowed a Chinese state company to take over the facility on a 99-year lease in 2017.The deal raised fears about Beijing's use of ""debt traps"" in exerting its influence abroad, including in the Indian Ocean.","IMF warns Maldives against looming ""debt distress"" as it looks set to borrow more from China.

A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for investors holding other currencies.Oil prices also fell amid signs of weak demand, ANZ analysts said in a note, as US gasoline and distillate inventories rose in the week ahead of the start of the US driving season.Refiners globally are struggling with slumping profits for diesel as new refineries boost supplies and as mild weather in the northern hemisphere and slow economic activity eat into demand.Still, the market remained supported by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, together known as OPEC+, could extend supply cuts into the second half of the year.Iraq, the second-largest OPEC producer, is committed to voluntary oil production cuts agreed by OPEC and is keen to cooperate with member countries on efforts to achieve more stability in global oil markets , its oil minister told the state news agency on Sunday.The minister's comments followed his suggestion on Saturday that Iraq had made enough voluntary reductions and would not agree to any additional cuts proposed by the wider OPEC+ producer group at its meeting in early June.Earlier this month, OPEC+ called out Iraq for pumping over its output quota by a cumulative 602,000 barrels per day in the first three months of 2024. The group said that Baghdad had agreed to compensate with additional production cuts over the rest of the year.""Iraq has fallen short of its additional voluntary cuts since the beginning of the year and so the willingness and ability for Iraq to cut more is likely limited,"" ING analysts said in a note.""There will likely be increased noise in the lead-up to the next Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) meeting scheduled for 1 June.""In the US, the oil rig count fell by three to 496 last week, their lowest since November, Baker Hughes said in its weekly report on Friday.","Brent crude futures slid 7 cents, or 0.1%, to $82.72 a barrel by 0624 GMT.

KATHMANDU: Mount Everest saw a record-breaking day Sunday as Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa and Briton Kenton Cool reached the top of the world's highest mountain , extending their records for the most summits by a Nepali and a foreigner.Sherpa, 54, reached the peak for the 29th time and Cool, 50, made his 18th summit .""Kami Rita and Kenton Cool both reached the summit today, making records,"" Rakesh Gurung of Nepal's tourism department told AFP.A guide for more than two decades, Sherpa, also known as ""Everest Man"", first summited the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) peak in 1994 when working for a commercial expedition.He has since climbed Everest almost every year, guiding clients. It was not immediately clear whether he had a client with him on Sunday.""Back again for the 29th summit to the top of the world... One man's job, another man/woman's dream,"" Sherpa posted on his Instagram account from base camp last week.Sherpa climbed Everest twice last year to reclaim his record after another guide, Pasang Dawa Sherpa , equalled his number of ascents.Kami Rita Sherpa has previously said that he has been ""just working"" and did not plan on setting records.He has also conquered other challenging 8,000-metre peaks including the world's second-highest mountain, K2 in Pakistan.Cool, also a guide, was once told he would not walk unaided again after a rock-climbing accident in 1996 that broke both his heel bones, but his mountaineering career has confounded predictions.He told AFP in a 2022 interview after his 16th ascent that his Everest record was ""not that amazing"" in the context of Nepali climbers' achievements.""I'm really surprised by the interest... considering that so many of the Sherpas have so many more ascents,"" he said then.Nepal has issued 414 Everest permits to mountaineers for this year's spring climbing season, which runs from April to early June.Most Everest hopefuls are escorted by a Nepali guide, meaning more than 800 climbers will tread the path to the top of the world's highest peak in the coming weeks after a group of Nepali climbers opened the route to the summit on Friday.China also reopened the Tibetan route to foreigners this year for the first time since closing it in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.Nepal is home to eight of the world's 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds are typically calm.A climbing boom has made mountaineering a lucrative business since Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay made the first ascent in 1953.More than 600 climbers made it to the summit of Everest last year but it was also the deadliest season on the mountain, with 18 fatalities.","Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa and Briton Kenton Cool reach the top of Mount Everest.

'Royal rift': Prince Harry in tears as King Charles honors Prince William',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/royal-rift-prince-harry-in-tears-as-king-charles-honors-prince-william/articleshow/110059418.cms,"Prince Harry was reportedly brought to tears after King Charles conferred a prestigious military honor upon his elder brother, Prince William , heightening the ongoing royal family tensions. According to royal expert Tom Quinn , the timing of the announcement seemed designed to deepen the strain, coinciding with Harry's return to London to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games—an event significantly meaningful to him.On this emotionally charged day, Buckingham Palace declared that William, 41, would be appointed as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps. This role was notably significant as Harry, 39, had served with distinction in the same unit during his deployment in Afghanistan. Quinn described the decision as ""a real kick in the teeth for the son who always felt marginalized and underrated,"" suggesting the announcement was a deliberate snub.The designation of this role to William, whom Harry reportedly views as a central figure in his personal struggles, added an extra layer of hurt. Quinn articulated the symbolic weight of the appointment, saying, ""They [the royal family] have decided the gloves are off and that Harry needs to realize that when you betray the family, you don’t just escape the things you hated doing as a working royal—you also lose the things you loved.""This event underscores the deep divisions within the royal family, with Harry having stepped down as a senior royal in 2020 and now living in California with his wife, Meghan Markle, and their children. His brief return to the UK was marked not only by his absence at family gatherings but also by this poignant military honor bestowed upon his brother, signifying perhaps a final severing of his ties to his former life within the British military and royal duties.Prince William, while not involved in active combat, served as a search and rescue pilot and later as an air ambulance pilot, roles that have endeared him in the public eye. Meanwhile, Harry’s contributions during his second tour in Afghanistan and subsequent veteran advocacy, highlighted by his involvement with the Invictus Games, paint a picture of a prince deeply connected to his military roots, making this latest development particularly poignant.This complex weave of personal achievements, familial duty, and public service continues to unfold publicly, reflecting the challenging dynamics of modern royal responsibilities and personal desires.","Prince Harry was reportedly brought to tears after King Charles conferred a prestigious military honor upon his elder brother, Prince William.

Wildlife trafficking overall has not been substantially reduced over two decades,"" said the body's third ""World Wildlife Crime Report"", with around 4,000 plant and animal species impacted in countries around the world.""The global scope and scale of wildlife crime remain substantial,"" it added, calling for measures, such as more consistent enforcement and effective implementation of anti-corruption and other laws.The proportion reached its highest levels during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, when wildlife seizures made up around 1.4-1.9 percent of global wildlife trade, compared to between 0.5-1.1 percent during the previous four years, it said.""We're not seeing a reduction in that proportion of illegal trade ... so that's why we're saying it's not on track,"" researcher Steven Broad involved in the report told AFP.But in positive news, poaching, seizure levels, and market prices have ""declined solidly"" for ""iconic"" commodities from elephants and rhinoceros over the past decade, the report added.""We have seen a sustained decline over the last 10 years, which shows that it can be done,"" Broad said.UNODC warned that wildlife trafficking can ""disrupt delicate ecosystems"".""Some of the species worse affected like rare orchids, succulents, reptiles, fish, birds, and mammals receive little public attention, though wildlife trafficking appears to have played a major role in their local or global extinctions,"" it noted.The report is based on, among others, 140,000 records of wildlife seizures reported to have taken place between 2015 and 2021.Corals were the most frequently seized, accounting for 16 percent of all seizures, followed by crocodilians with nine percent.The 169-page report is the UNODC's third report on wildlife trafficking following reports in 2016 and 2020.","The proportion of the global wildlife trade that is illegal has risen, the UN reported Monday.

EU countries to seek more power grid funding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-countries-to-seek-more-power-grid-funding/articleshow/110088553.cms,"BRUSSELS: European Union countries will ask Brussels to find ways to increase funding for power grids as concerns mount that ageing electricity infrastructure could hamper Europe's green goals, a draft document showed.Europe's plans to shift to clean energy will require a huge expansion of power grids, transforming the network to connect consumers to massive new offshore wind farms, fleets of local solar panels, and the installation of millions of charging stations for electric vehicles.EU countries will ask the European Commission to assess how current EU funds are available for power grids compared with the far bigger actual investment needs and produce guidance on how to use more EU funds for grid projects, according to draft conclusions for a meeting of EU energy ministers on May 30.The conclusions, seen by Reuters, said the Commission should then ""look for ways to increase overall financing for electricity grid infrastructure"".The document called on the European Investment Bank to also strengthen its support for power grid projects, including by de-risking projects to help attract private finance.Current investments in grids lag far behind the 584 billion euros per year the EU says are needed to meet green goals.The EU added dozens of power grid projects last year to a list of schemes eligible for fast-tracked permits and certain EU funds.Kristian Ruby, secretary general of industry group Eurelectric , said more needed to be done to speed up investments and avoid a situation where newly-built green energy projects have to wait years to be connected to ailing power networks.""We need to make sure that there is an active incentive for the grid operators to make use of public funds,"" he said.More than 35,000 power plants requested new connections to Austria's power grid in 2022, for example—more than three times the number received in 2021, with most requests coming from solar plants.Diplomats said one issue proving particularly difficult among EU governments was how they should share the costs of massive new power projects, such as offshore wind farms, designed to feed electricity to multiple countries.",Europe's plans to shift to clean energy will require a huge expansion of power grids.

UN nears landmark deal on combatting biopiracy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/un-nears-landmark-deal-on-combatting-biopiracy/articleshow/110084604.cms,"GENEVA: The fight against biopiracy plundering genetic resources and the traditional knowledge surrounding them could soon be based on an international treaty, which is being finalized at negotiations that began on Monday. ""Let me be candid negotiations will not be easy,"" warned Daren Tang, head of the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ), as the diplomatic conference in Geneva got underway.After more than 20 years of talks on the subject, WIPO's more than 190 member states are meeting at the agency's Geneva headquarters until May 24 for negotiations on finalizing a treaty. The United Nations agency dealing with patenting and innovation will try to conclude an agreement by consensus. Tang said countries were on ""the cusp of a truly landmark agreement"".""There is no contradiction between a robust and predictable IP regime one that incentivizes innovation, attracts investments and drives game-changing research and one that responds to the needs of all countries and their communities everywhere, including those from Indigenous peoples, as well as from local communities,"" he said.The draft treaty text says patent applicants would be required to disclose which country the genetic resources in an invention came from, and the indigenous people who provided the associated traditional knowledge.""It's about fighting biopiracy that's to say the use of traditional knowledge or genetic resources without the agreement of those who held them and without them being able to benefit from them,"" said Christophe Bigot, who is leading the French delegation.Medicines, seeds, cosmetics while natural genetic resources such as those found in medicinal plants, agricultural crops and animal breeds cannot be directly protected as international property, inventions developed using them can be patented. These resources are increasingly used by companies in everything from cosmetics to seeds, medicines, biotechnology and food supplements.As it is currently not mandatory to publish the origin of innovations, many developing countries are concerned that patents are being granted that either circumvent the rights of indigenous people, or are issued for existing inventions. Such cases can end up in lengthy legal battles. Opponents of the treaty fear it will hamper innovation. But proponents say an additional disclosure requirement would increase legal certainty, transparency and efficiency in the patent system.They say it will ""help ensure that such knowledge and resources are used with the permission of the countries and/or communities from which they originate, enabling them to benefit in some way from the resulting inventions"", according to Wend Wendland, the director of WIPO's traditional knowledge division.Disagreements persist, notably on setting up sanctions, and the conditions for revoking patents. ""The text has been narrowed down a lot in order to arrive at some potential compromise,"" expert Viviana Munoz Tellez of the South Centre, an intergovernmental think-tank representing the interests of 55 developing countries, told AFP.The proposed treaty has ""symbolic value because it's the first time that there will be some reference for example to traditional knowledge in an IP instrument"", said Munoz Tellez.Overcoming North-South clashes More than 30 countries have such disclosure requirements in their national laws. Most of these are emerging economies, including China, Brazil, India and South Africa, but there are also European states, such as France, Germany and Switzerland. However, these procedures vary and are not always mandatory. ""It is important to get beyond clashes that are too sterile"" between the global North and South, said one diplomat, on condition of anonymity.""Several countries in the North have genetic resources, like Australia or France, and several countries in the South have very large laboratories and companies that use genetic resources, like India or Brazil,"" the source added. Two years ago, countries unexpectedly agreed to convene a diplomatic conference in 2024 to conclude an agreement. Only the United States and Japan officially dissociated themselves from the decision, without however opposing the consensus. Japan's mission in Geneva told AFP it hoped the outcome of the conference would be ""clear, reasonable and practical to apply"".",World Intellectual Property Organization meeting in Geneva to finalize treaty on biopiracy.
