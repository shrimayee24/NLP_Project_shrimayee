Legal system acknowledges fallibility of judges: SC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has said that judges are also fallible, and courts should not shy away from accepting mistakes in their orders and rectify them even after a case has been closed.Over a year after SC passed an interim order granting protection to Indiabulls Housing Finance and its officials, and stayed proceedings of debt recovery and in money laundering cases against them, the court admitted ""certain errors crept in its order by oversight"".The apparent mistake was that the restraint order was passed against Enforcement Directorate without granting a hearing to the agency, which sought modification of the order. The order, passed by Justice Krishna Murari and Justice Sanjay Kumar, had another flaw - it asked the parties to approach high court to raise their grievances, but at the same time granted interim protection that would continue during pendency of the case in HC.Normally, Supreme Court's protection remains in place till the parties have approached high court, with the apex court leaving it to HC to take a decision on interim protection.On Tuesday, a bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar and Justice Aravind Kumar acknowledged the twin errors and modified the order, saying the interim protection in recovery proceedings would be till the parties moved HC and then it would be for HC to decide on interim order.""The stay of proceedings granted by this court in the writ petition, in relation to the first three FIRs, was directed to continue till the disposal of the writ petitions to be filed before HCs. When a party is relegated to HC to pursue its remedies, it would not be proper, in the normal course, to bind the said HC with directions in relation to the proceedings to be impugned before such court. Ordinarily, this court would leave all issues open for the party so relegated to raise and pursue before HC,"" the bench said.""Being the court of last resort, this court would not shy away from acknowledging any mistakes in its orders and would be ready to set right such wrongs,"" the bench said, allowing ED's plea, and withdrew the part of the order relating to the money laundering case it had passed on July 4 last year.Referring to the SC judgment in V K Jain vs Delhi HC, the bench said, ""Our legal system acknowledges the fallibility of judges. Though this observation was made in the context of judges of the district judiciary, it would be equally applicable to those in higher echelons of the judicial hierarchy. As courts of record, it is necessary that constitutional courts recognise errors that may have crept into their judicial orders and rectify the same when called upon to do so.""Justice Krishna Murari had superannuated in the interregnum.","Supreme Court said that judges are also fallible, and courts should not shy away from accepting mistakes in their orders.

Delhi airport to get India's first air train by 2027 for seamless terminal connectivity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-airport-to-get-indias-first-air-train-by-2027-for-seamless-terminal-connectivity/articleshow/113614923.cms,"Transiting between Delhi Airport ’s Terminal 3 & T2 on one side and T1 on the other will finally be a breeze before the end of calendar year 2027. Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) has issued the tender to built an air train or automated people mover (APM) that will have four stops — T2/3, T1, Aerocity and cargo city . The GMR-backed DIAL has given the alignment for this 7.7-km route.Once ready, trudging by DTC buses between these two distant terminals from city side will be a thing of the past.Sources say the airport operator is likely to get bids for what will India’s first air train at an airport, in Oct and Nov. The winning bidder will be decided based on the cost quoted by different parties and whether they offer a revenue share model or seek viability gap funding for the project. “If all goes well, contract will be awarded before the end of this fiscal. Work will then begin and it is targeted to be over before end of CY 2027. That is what has been conveyed to the Union aviation ministry by DIAL,” say sources.The tender document says: “DIAL proposes to implement an elevated cum at-grade APM system at Delhi International Airport on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) model. The APM system is intended to provide reliable, fast and seamless connectivity between T1 and T3/2 spanning route length of around 7.7 km via Aerocity and Cargo city. In addition to providing required connectivity between terminals, APM system will enhance passenger convenience, improve ASQ score and reduce carbon footprint.”The aviation ministry in Modi 2.0 had told DIAL it will not allow levy of any development fees to fund this project before the same is ready. While the cost of IGIA air train is not known as the same has been left for bidders to evaluate and quote accordingly, the same could be under Rs 2,000 crore, say sources.Govt had earlier also asked DIAL to drop its plan for six stops on the proposed air train as the same would have been “too long with higher connecting time between T1 and T2/3.”“DIAL’s model for having so many stops, including two at Aerocity, will not only mean higher travel time between T1 and T2/3 but also require foolproof security at the non terminal stops,” a senior Govt official had said last Nov when that plan was discussed.Delhi Airport — India’s busiest hub handles over 7 crore passengers annually at present and is doubling its capacity to over 13 crore within the next 6-8 years — desperately needs the air train. It is estimated 25% travellers at IGIA will be transit flyers , hence the need for ensuring seamless transfers between T1 and T3/2. There is no way these volumes can be handled without an air train between terminals.Air trains globally are free to use for passengers to ensure seamless transit between terminals. However, the cost of augmenting airport infra is recovered through two means — AERA deciding aeronautical charges for airlines like landing and parking fees who accordingly decide fares; and through UDF on passengers. The UDF charged at Mumbai Airport, for instance, used to have a metro component of Rs 20 and Rs 120 per domestic and international departure respectively. This was component was levied from 2016 to February 2023 to raise Rs 518 crore for metro connectivity and was stopped when that target sum was raised.",The GMR-backed DIAL has given the alignment for this 7.7-km route.

Agencies blamed for negligence for Silkyara tunnel collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silkyara-probe-reveals-agencies-negligence/articleshow/113648356.cms,"Silkyara tunnel

NEW DELHI: The final probe report on last year’s Silkyara tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand has found negligence on part of the entity that prepared the detailed project report (DPR), construction firm, supervision consultant or authority engineer (AE), and National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL).It said the fixing of alignment did not meet basic principles of tunnelling, and there was negligence on part of the contractor to address the issue of 21 minor collapses, despite AE flagging them.Sources said the probe panel headed by former Border Road Organisation director general R K Dhiman submitted the report to the road transport ministry last week.Highlighting the lack of coordination and information flow among the stakeholders and how they overlooked responsibilities, the panel has recommended that the govt may initiate penal action against delinquent personnel and officers after carrying out an inquiry.“We will study and take necessary action,” a top ministry official said.TOI has learnt that probe found that the DPR was based on limited geological and geotechnical investigations, the alignment could have been modified to eliminate weak or shear zones, and no expert third party review was done, which was a deviation from normal practice.The report highlighted how the construction company did not conduct a proper investigation, and there were issues with design and execution.It has flagged incompetence of contractor, AE and approving authority NHIDCL, mentioning that evidence showed no measure was taken to address the shear zone issue.Shear zone refers to highly deformed, weak and thinned rocks due to high level of regional stress, and such zones require special attention, greater monitoring of ground behaviour and more support to avoid any mishap.As per the report, incorrect value of rock mass rating (RMR) was adopted to keep the rock mass classification as Class-IV instead of Class-V, which was the primary reason for several minor collapses.It said an adequate monitoring plan was not implemented due to which correct deformation details were not established. The deformations were not being addressed properly, which was one of the reasons for the massive collapse that resulted in 41 workers getting trapped for 17 days.The report has mentioned how reprofiling was carried out in distressed zones without ensuring the safety and safe passage of workers, and how the methodology for reprofiling was not vetted by AE. Senior geologist and material engineer, who play a key role in identifying geology and ensuring quality of work, were also absent during the last one year.For completion of the project, the panel has recommended clearing off debris in the collapsed section and conducting a detailed inspection of inaccessible sections of the tunnel for condition assessment. It has suggested immediate dewatering, and redesign and modification of the construction methodology to align geological conditions.","The final probe report on last year’s Silkyara tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand has found negligence on part of the entity that prepared the detailed project report.

India has invited political and military opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta to attend a seminar in New Delhi, sources said, a significant move by the South Asian power that has maintained ties with the top generals shunned by Western nations.A civil war in Myanmar since its military unseated an elected civilian govt in a Feb 2021 coup now risks destabilising India's 1,650-km border with Myanmar, and some of its key infrastructure projects there.A functionary of an armed group and two sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the parallel National Unity Govt (NUG) and ethnic minority rebels from the states of Chin, Rakhine and Kachin bordering India had been invited to a seminar in mid-Nov.The event would be hosted by govt-funded Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA), whose council includes foreign minister S Jaishankar, said two other sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity..It was not immediately clear if Myanmar's military govt would also be invited to the event, which sources said would be on the topic of ""Constitutionalism and Federalism"". They gave no further details.Widespread protest in Myanmar over the 2021 coup turned into a nationwide rebellion, with an armed resistance movement combining with some established ethnic armies to seize control of wide swathes of territory from the military.The junta has refused to enter into dialogue with the rebels, whom it describes as ""terrorists"".Speaking of the seminar, Sui Khar, vice chairman of one of the ethnic rebel groups, Chin National Front, said, ""We are going to send representatives. This will be the first time, I think, formally, that India will engage with the non-state actors. This is a good, positive approach.""A spokesperson for Myanmar's military did not answer telephone calls to seek comment. Indian govt and ICWA did not respond to requests for comment.The other armed groups invited include Arakan Army, which controls significant reaches of territory in Rakhine bordering Bangladesh, and Kachin Independence Army (KIA), one of Myanmar's most powerful rebel forces, sources added.A spokesperson for president of the shadow NUG govt declined to comment on the seminar. Arakan Army and KIA did not respond to requests for comment.Although the junta has been condemned by Western powers, with most of them having imposed sanctions, India has kept up engagement with the generals through visits to the capital, Naypyitaw, by its govt and defence officials.India has been reluctant to openly criticise the junta, which could push the generals closer to rival China. New Delhi has had no formal engagement with the junta's opponents.It was not immediately clear what the seminar would seek to achieve or why India has made the move.In June, Jaishankar voiced concern about border instability and security risks to India's projects in Myanmar. India was ""open to engaging all stakeholders in addressing this situation,"" he told his Myanmar counterpart.India is involved in developing the $400-million Kaladan port and highway project in Myanmar's west, as well as providing about $250 million for another road project to link its landlocked northeastern states with Thailand, via Myanmar.The seminar plan comes amid a peace effort by Asean grouping of Southeast Asian nations that has made scant progress since its unveiling in April 2021, as some Asean nations have been vexed by the junta's refusal of talks.Last year, former Asean chair Indonesia said it had received positive signals about preliminary dialogue from major parties in the conflict, but there have been no signs advancement yet.The Nov meeting would represent New Delhi's serious effort to approach Myanmar's ""pro-democracy side"" since the 2021 coup, said Angshuman Choudhury, a Singapore-based researcher who closely tracks India-Myanmar affairs.""We also need to see ... whether it is meant to achieve specific foreign policy outcomes or simply relay a signal to Myanmar military to step back,"" he said.","India has invited political and military opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta to attend a seminar in New Delhi, sources said.

Dhaka has lodged a strong protest against the ""highly deplorable"" remarks reportedly made by Union home minister Amit Shah about Bangladeshi nationals during his recent visit to Jharkhand .Bangladesh interim govt's ministry of foreign affairs handed over a protest note Monday to the Indian deputy high commissioner in Dhaka.Through the note, Dhaka conveyed its ""serious reservation, deep sense of hurt and extreme displeasure"". The ministry emphasised that such remarks, coming from responsible positions, against nationals of a neighbouring country, undermine the spirit of mutual respect and understanding between two friendly countries.Shah had accused the JMM-led coalition govt in Jharkhand on Friday of encouraging illegal infiltration for its ""vote bank politics"" and cautioned that if not checked, such immigrants would become a majority in the state in the next 25-30 years. ""There is no place for infiltrators in the state. They are marrying our daughters, grabbing land and destroying rich tribal culture and heritage... we will drive each one of them out... Let the lotus bloom here,"" Shah had said at a rally in Bokaro.He claimed the tribal population in Santhal Pargana division had decreased from 44% to 28% due to infiltration. He also mentioned scams during the current administration, including the Rs 1,000 crore mining scam in Sahibganj district, Army land scam and paper leak scam. "" BJP govt would hang those elements involved in leaking question papers of recruitment examination upside down,"" he had said.","Bangladesh has lodged a strong protest against the ""highly deplorable"" remarks reportedly made by Union home minister Amit Shah.

"""Tom Brady's problem, and ours, is his voice"": Tom Brady Faces Criticism From ESPN Analyst For His Broadcast Skills",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-problem-and-ours-is-his-voice-tom-brady-faces-criticism-from-espn-analyst-for-his-broadcast-skills/articleshow/113619223.cms,"ESPN Analyst Criticizes Tom Brady



Tom Brady , the legendary quarterback who redefined the NFL , has transitioned to the broadcasting booth, and the initial reviews have been mixed. While some appreciate his unique perspective and insights, others have criticized his commentary , questioning his ability to effectively communicate his thoughts.Also Read: “That's the dirtiest s**t I ever saw in football”: C.J. Gardner-Johnson on Khristian Boyd as his hit left DeVonta Smith concussed While Tom Brady's knowledge of the game is undeniable, the same cannot be said for his delivery in the broadcasting style, which has drawn criticism from several quarters.One of the most notable critiques came from ESPN's senior writer Don Van Natta, who pointed out a particular flaw in Brady's broadcasting career.According to Van Natta, no matter how much Brady improves in delivering his commentary, his voice has been perceived as a significant hindrance. It was mentioned by Van Natta that ""Tom Brady's problem, and ours, is his voice. No matter how much his commentary might improve, Brady's delivery system teeters between mildly annoying to nails-on-a-chalkboard."" This has led some viewers to feel disconnected from his insights, despite the depth of his football expertise.Brady's broadcasting journey began three weeks ago, stepping into Greg Olsen's shoes as FOX's top color commentator. Over the past few weeks, he has covered three consecutive Dallas Cowboys games, with mixed reviews about his performance. While some felt he appeared nervous during his debut, with awkward pauses during the broadcast, others noticed a marked improvement in his second week covering the Cowboys-Saints game. However, the criticism resurfaced during his commentary on the Ravens' game, pointing to an ongoing challenge in mastering his new role.Despite the harsh reviews, Brady remains focused on other aspects of his post-NFL career, particularly his fitness. The seven-time Super Bowl champion recently shared images on Instagram, showing off his impressive physique. His caption humorously highlighted his commitment to staying in shape, noting that ""Color analysts have to stay in shape too!"" Brady continues to follow an intense workout regime that includes activities like weighted step-ups, resistance band pushups, and box jumps, with swimming recently added to the routine.While his broadcasting career may be off to a shaky start, one thing remains clear—Brady's dedication to maintaining his physical health is unwavering, showing that even off the field, he continues to strive for excellence in every aspect of his life.Also Read: “I would have booed us too”: Las Vegas Raiders coach Antonio Pierce wasn't happy after his team's 36-22 defeat on Sunday","Brady's broadcasting career began three weeks ago, stepping into Greg Olsen's shoes as FOX's top color commentator.

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal: My job search struggle sounds insane with 65 interviews… but that was my reality when I …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/shark-tank-judge-anupam-mittal-my-job-search-struggle-sounds-insane-with-65-interviews-but-that-was-my-reality-when-i-/articleshow/113585761.cms,"Here’s the full text of Anupam Mittal’s LinkedIn post



I had to make >800 applications and sit through 65 interviews before landing my first job.

Sounds insane but that was my reality when I graduated in the US - during a recession!

The job market was brutal, and every door seemed to be slammed shut—especially in the tech and VC industry, where I desperately wanted to work.

And unfortunately, I wasn’t from Harvard, Yale or Stanford or any other Ivy League.

I watched as others walked into jobs I knew I was capable of doing, and honestly, it drove me nuts. Every application, email, and interview hit a dead end.

But quitting was never on the table although I was dead-broke and finding it hard to make ends meet.

So, when Y2K came around and COBOL became a hot skill, I rolled up my sleeves & taught myself basic mainframe coding.

Eventually, landed an entry-level job as a COBOL programmer with Keane – I hated every minute of it 😥

Fortunately, just before I completely lost my mind, I got a call from

MicroStrategy

in Boston and was quickly hired as a pre-sales consultant.

But I knew the real action was in their Washington D.C. HQ. So, I took a shot in the dark and wrote directly to Michael Saylor the founder & CEO, asking for a role in their new venture Strategy.com

I got the role 😅 > Moved to D.C. > 2 years later, I was Director of Strategic Partnerships at a company that was the toast of Wall Street and darling of the tech world💪🏼

We went from a $100m to $40b mkt cap in that time. Yeah, let that sink in🚀

That job & my time in the US shaped me into who I am today🙏

But here’s the thing - this struggle wasn't just about landing a job- it was also about proving to myself that I was as good as the best.

To every struggler out there, the road is tough, but every ""no"" gets us closer to a yes, and that one ""yes"" has the power to change everything in our lives ✅

So, keep pushing, keep learning, and keep fighting for what you deserve coz our breakthroughs are out there. Sometimes they just need a little time to find us 🤗

Anupam Mittal - founder and CEO of People group has shared a post on LinkedIn, recounting his early career challenges, and how he sat through 65 interviews to land his first job. “I had to make >800 applications and sit through 65 interviews before landing my first job.

It has previously said that it placed ""the highest importance on the well-being of all employees"" and was ""taking the family's correspondence with the utmost seriousness and humility"".Perayil's mother, Anita Augustine, alleged her daughter faced ""overwhelming workload"" in her letter, which went viral on social media. ""She worked late into the night, even on weekends, with no opportunity to catch her breath.""Perayil's family has said she died of cardiac arrest.Pol said his team has also sought details from EY including the company's log book for employee hours, welfare policies and whether Perayil was asked to work excessively during her four months as an associate at the accounting giant.EY said it works with about 100,000 people at its member firms in India.($1 = 83.6390 Indian rupees)","An Ernst & Young office in western India, which employed a 26-year-old who allegedly died after facing a high workload, has operated since 2007 without a state permit which regulates work hours.EY faces scrutiny in India over the death of audit executive Anna Sebastian Perayil.

Now, OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman has also revealed that he has been taking psychedelic drugs.As reported by Business Insider, in a recent interview on the podcast ""Life in Seven Songs, Altman revealed how a weekend retreat in Mexico significantly impacted his life and perspective.Altman described psychedelic drug use as one of the most transformative experiences of his life. He stated that psychedelic experiences can be ""incredibly powerful"" and that they have personally been life-altering.For those unaware, Psychedelic drugs have been used across different cultures for spiritual and healing purposes. Recently, there has been a renewed focus on their potential therapeutic applications, particularly in the areas of mental health and self-discovery.Despite his reputation for confidence and charm, the billionaire revealed that he used to be a ""very anxious, unhappy person."" ""If you had told me that, like, one weekend-long retreat in Mexico was going to significantly change that, I would have said absolutely not,"" said Altman.The CEO stated that while he has tried psychedelics at Burning Man(a week-long large-scale desert event, held annually in the western United States), his most profound experiences have been with guided psychedelic retreats. He characterised his experiences at Burning Man as less transformative and rare occurrences.Altman's interest in psychedelics extends beyond personal experiences. He has served as the board chairman of Journey Colab , a startup focusing on developing clinical psychedelic drugs for addiction therapy.Austen Allred, the San Francisco-based CEO and co-founder of BloomTech claimed that eight Silicon Valley CEOs have resigned from their positions after experimenting with psychedelic drugs. The post, which has been widely shared on X (formerly Twitter), alleges that these high-ranking executives at prominent tech companies decided to leave their jobs following their experiences with psychedelics. While the post does not provide specific names or companies.“Of the Silicon Valley founders I know who went on some of the psychedelic self-discovery trips, almost 100% quit their jobs as CEO within a year. Could be random anecdotes, but be careful with that stuff,” posted Allred on X.Responding to a post by X user Ashlee Vance, the CEO of BloomTech claimed that a venture capitalist had told him, ""Ayahuasca has caused us to lose several promising founders. They came back to work with a lack of motivation.""In the comments section of the post, Allred stated that he was aware of eight CEOs who had resigned from their jobs after using psychedelics. When asked, ""How many do you think are happier now?"", he replied that four of them seemed content after stepping down as CEOs.","Austen Allred, the CEO and co-founder of BloomTech claimed that eight Silicon Valley CEOs have resigned from their positions after experimenting with psychedelic drugs.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

In a recent study conducted by WalletHub, the personal-finance outlet assessed the happiness levels across all 50 states in the U.S. by examining various factors contributing to emotional and physical well-being. While happiness can be subjective, WalletHub's research aimed to quantify it using three main categories: emotional and physical well-being, work environment, and community and environment.This comprehensive analysis utilized a total of 30 metrics, including life expectancy, rates of adult depression, commute times, unemployment figures, and divorce rates, drawing data from credible sources like the U.S.Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The findings revealed a stark reality: many of the unhappiest states are primarily rural, low-income regions, particularly in the Deep South. WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo noted that these states tend to rank poorly not just in happiness but across various economic and socioeconomic metrics. Here’s a look at the 10 unhappiest states in the U.S.Kentucky ranked as the 10th unhappiest state, with low scores in both emotional and physical well-being and work environment. The CDC reports that 25.8% of adults in Kentucky have been diagnosed with a depressive disorder, exceeding the national average. Additionally, the state's life expectancy is notably low at 73.5 years, and its employment rate sits at 57.4%, below the national average.Despite these challenges, Kentucky fared better in community and environment, finishing 16th in this category.Mississippi ranks as the 9th unhappiest state, finishing 41st for emotional and physical well-being and 40th for work environment. The state has the lowest life expectancy in the nation at just 71.9 years and a significant employment rate of only 54.3%.The state's residents also work longer hours on average than the national norm. In terms of community and environment, Mississippi ranked 35th, with low volunteer rates and high divorce rates.In Oklahoma, the emotional and physical well-being index is particularly low, with a ranking of 48th. Approximately 27% of adults report being diagnosed with depression. Nevertheless, the state performs surprisingly well in community and environment, finishing 5th overall, which helps mitigate its lower rankings in other areas.Alabama ranks 7th, performing poorly in both emotional and physical well-being and community and environment. With a life expectancy of just 73.2 years and a depression rate of 24%, Alabama faces significant challenges. The state does show better performance in work environment metrics, where it ranked 33rd overall.Alaska's lowest score of 48th comes from its work environment, with the longest work hours and minimal income growth. While the state's emotional and physical well-being is relatively better, ranking 33rd, it still faces challenges due to high depression rates and a lower life expectancy of 76.6 years.New Mexico is the fifth unhappiest state, particularly struggling with emotional and physical well-being and work environment metrics. Although it ranks 24th in community and environment, it has a low employment rate of 55% and high divorce rates, indicating significant societal challenges.Tennessee has mixed rankings, finishing 24th for work environment but plummeting to 46th for emotional and physical well-being. High rates of adult depression and a low life expectancy contribute to its unhappy status, despite economic growth in urban areas like Nashville.Ranking third, West Virginia has the lowest score for workplace environment and a very low employment rate of 51.7%. The state's economic struggles are compounded by high depression rates and lower life expectancy. Interestingly, it does score well in community and environment metrics, suggesting residents find some solace in their local environments.Arkansas is the second unhappiest state, particularly noted for its low emotional and physical well-being scores. The state has high rates of depression and low life expectancy. Despite these challenges, its community and environment rank is relatively moderate.Finally, Louisiana is ranked as the unhappiest state in the U.S., with concerning statistics for emotional and physical well-being and work environment. The state has high rates of depression and low life expectancy, alongside low employment figures. With significant challenges in community and environment as well, Louisiana's position as the unhappiest state reflects deep-rooted socio economic issues.","Kentucky ranked as the 10th unhappiest state, with low scores in both emotional and physical well-being and work environment.
