NEW DELHI: In anticipation of Cyclone Remal's impending landfall , Kolkata airport authorities on Saturday announced the suspension of flight operations for 21 hours, starting from midnight on Sunday. The decision comes amidst warnings issued by the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) regarding the intensifying cyclonic storm.""The deep depression intensified into a Cyclonic Storm ""Remal"" over the Northwest and adjoining Northeast & East-central Bay of Bengal at 5.30 pm on May 25,"" IMD said in a statement.According to IMD scientist Dr. Somenath Dutta , Cyclone Remal , is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm over your east central and adjoining North Bay today.""It will continue to move further northward. It will intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by May 26,"" Dr. Dutta said.The cyclone is projected to make landfall between Sagar Island and Khepupara, affecting regions of Bangladesh and adjoining West Bengal.The cyclone's formation was initiated by a low-pressure system over the southwest and west-central Bay of Bengal, which has since intensified into Cyclone Remal . IMD forecasts suggest that the cyclone will continue to gain strength, posing threats of heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges along its path.According to the weather agency, a light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places is likely over coastal districts of West Bengal and adjoining districts of North Odisha on 26th and 27th May. Similiarly the light to moderate rainfall will be seen at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places is likely over Mizoram, Tripura and South Manipur on 26th and 27th May.","Kolkata airport authorities have suspended flight operations for 21 hours.

"Flyers face tighter scrutiny at Dubai, Abu Dhabi airports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flyers-face-tighter-scrutiny-at-dubai-abu-dhabi-airports/articleshow/110427947.cms,"CHENNAI: If you are flying to the UAE, ensure you have at least Rs 60,000 in your bank account or a credit card, and a return ticket , as immigration scrutiny has been made stringent at Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports in an attempt to prevent people from misusing tourist visas . Sources said passengers, especially first-time travellers , landing from airports in Tamil Nadu and Kerala are being randomly scrutinised.Travellers to Dubai and Abu Dhabi are facing delayed check-in at the city airport after the UAE deported a few passengers for not carrying return tickets or enough money for their stay with a tourist visa. Airlines have also started to screen solo travellers in the age group of 20-35 with tourist visas and are double-checking before boarding them to prevent passengers from getting deported. It's the airline's responsibility to bring back the deported passengers. The UAE has tightened the implementation of immigration norms after they found that travellers land up without money or accommodation and sometimes misuse the 96-hour transit visa and stay on.Travel and tour operators have started to advise their customers about the strict rules being followed at immigration in UAE airports.Basheer Ahmed of Chennai Metro Travels said, ""The checks are happening because it has been found that people are entering the UAE for jobs using tourist visas. Some of them cancel their return tickets and stay on. Immigration officials were lenient until recently but have now started to tighten scrutiny. There is no problem for genuine tourists, family, and group travellers.""He said check-in at the airport takes time as low-cost carriers are checking passengers to see if they meet immigration norms to avoid deportation.Sources say that at least 10 people have been deported to India for travelling without return tickets or proof of accommodation.Sriharan Balan of Madura Travels said, ""Tourists are not affected. A large number of them are travelling to the UAE. Immigration is checking for two things: people entering the UAE for jobs on tourist visas and the Kuruvi movement. A UAE visa is issued by multiple emirates. They say that a visa issued by Abu Dhabi cannot be used for landing in Dubai, and vice versa. So a lot of scrutiny is going on.""Though summer is not the usual travel season, many have been travelling for holidays to Middle East. Flights are full and fares are high due to the demand.",Travellers to Dubai and Abu Dhabi are facing delayed check-in at the city airport.

Crippling heat wave in India peaks at 50 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan's Phalodi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crippling-heat-wave-in-india-peaks-at-50-degrees-celsius-in-rajasthans-phalodi/articleshow/110427147.cms,"NEW DELHI: Temperatures soared to a searing 50 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan's Phalodi on Sunday, as a brutal heatwave swept through large parts of India, testing the endurance of millions, including those who stepped out to vote in the sixth phase of the ongoing general elections. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), 50 degrees Celsius is the highest temperature recorded in the country since June 1, 2019, when Churu, also in Rajasthan, logged a scorching 50.8 degrees Celsius.Phalodi hit India's all-time high temperature of 51 degrees Celsius on May 19, 2016.The extreme heat affected not only the northern plains and central regions of the country but also the hills of Himachal Pradesh, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.Thousands of voters faced scorching temperatures as they stepped out to vote in the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections, held in 58 seats across eight states and Union territories, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and the national capital.Many stood in long queues without shade for extended periods. In some places, polling booths lacked water, coolers, and chairs for the elderly, exacerbating the impact of the heat.Some voters even fainted due to the extreme heat and hot winds in Delhi, where temperatures exceeded 45 degrees Celsius in six locations.West Bengal's Cooch Behar (40.5 degrees), Assam's Silchar (40), and Lumding (43), and Arunachal Pradesh's Itanagar (40.5) and Pasighat (39.6) recorded their all-time high temperatures.Assam's Tezpur (39.5), Mazbat (38.6), Dhubri (38.2), North Lakhimpur (39.2), and Mohanbari (38.8) also saw record-breaking temperatures for May.Official data showed that at least 17 places in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh recorded maximum temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius or above on Saturday.In Rajasthan, temperatures soared to 48.8 degrees Celsius in Barmer, 48 degrees in Jaisalmer, and 47.2 degrees in Bikaner, prompting the state's disaster management department to direct district collectors to make necessary arrangements to provide relief to people, animals, and birds from the heat.The extreme heat will continue in parts of Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra until May 29. The searing heat will also affect the hills of Himachal Pradesh, Assam, and Meghalaya.A 'red' warning has been issued for Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, west Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat, indicating a ""very high likelihood"" of heat illness and heatstroke for all age groups.The IMD said warm night conditions could further exacerbate heat-related stress in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and Rajasthan over the next four days.High night temperatures are particularly dangerous because the body doesn't get a chance to cool down. Increasing nighttime heat is more common in cities due to the urban heat island effect, where metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings.Akash Vashishtha, founder-secretary of the Society for Protection of Environment and Biodiversity, said that urban regions like Delhi-NCR become heat chambers due to land and surface concretisation, causing a heat multiplier effect.The severe heat wave conditions in Delhi-NCR are not just typical weather for this time of the year but the consequences of extensively concretised land surfaces creating 'urban heat islands', which amplify the trapped heat in the lower atmosphere.Incoming solar radiation, once reflected from the land surface, lacks open space to escape to the upper atmosphere.The heat gets trapped due to horizontal and vertical concretised structures, significantly raising ambient temperatures, he said.Vashishtha said immediate steps are needed to keep ground surfaces vegetated to absorb solar radiation and reduce heat reflection and radiation from land surfaces.The punishing heat in India is straining power grids and drying up water bodies, triggering drought-like conditions in parts of the country.According to the Central Water Commission, water storage in 150 major reservoirs in India plunged to its lowest level in five years last week, exacerbating water shortages in many states and significantly affecting hydropower generation.Water levels in the Delhi stretch of the Yamuna river have dropped amid the sweltering heat, affecting water supply. The city also saw power demand reach a record 8,000 megawatts on Wednesday, with air conditioners, coolers, and refrigerators in homes and offices running at full capacity.Severe and frequent heatwaves are further burdening low-income households, which often have poor access to water and cooling, and testing the endurance of outdoor workers toiling in the searing sun, forcing them to take frequent breaks.Anna Walnycki of the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development said, ""Low-income households have limited capacity to adapt to extreme heat because of poor access to water and electricity.""Additionally, the design and construction of informal houses often mean there is poor ventilation and little shelter from extreme heat.""Experts say outdoor workers, the elderly, and children are at higher risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.According to the World Health Organisation, more than 1,66,000 people died as a result of heat waves between 1998 and 2017.India reported 3,812 deaths due to heat waves between 2015 and 2022, with Andhra Pradesh alone logging 2,419 fatalities, the government told the Parliament in July last year.People are less productive during hot weather, and children struggle to learn.Shyamal Santra of the NGO Transform Rural India said studies show that students perform worse in tests when they experience a 'hot school year' compared to a 'cool school year.'""With 15 per cent of government schools in India not having a functional electricity connection and many being single-classroom schools, heat waves disproportionately affect rural educational outcomes,"" he said.In the absence of adequate cold-chain infrastructure, extreme heat can cause major damage to fresh produce. Studies show India faces food losses worth USD 13 billion a year, with only four percent of fresh produce covered by cold chain facilities.According to a World Bank report, India could account for 34 million of the projected 80 million global job losses from heat stress-associated productivity decline by 2030.","Temperatures soared to a searing 50 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan's Phalodi on Sunday, as a brutal heatwave swept through large parts of India.

"Delhi Temperature: Delhi Heat Index Soars to 50°C, Expected to Reach 56°C Amid High Humidity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/feels-like-50c-in-delhi-may-touch-56c/articleshow/110378782.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mercury in Delhi was at a scorching 41 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal, on Thursday, but the real feel was even more, like 50 degrees Celsius.It's not just the air temperature that affects individuals on a sweltering summer day as high humidity levels can make the heat feel even more oppressive. India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) has begun measuring the heat index or feel-like temperature, which considers both temperature and relative humidity, to provide a more accurate representation of the impact of a hot summer day.The heat index is the apparent temperature that people feel outside, an indication of the discomfort level. This exercise of calculating the heat index began on April 1. Till last year, IMD used to give only a heatwave forecast, based on the maximum temperature and its departure from the normal.The city saw the highest heat index of this season so far at 55.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday against the day temperature of 43.4. Thursday's feel-like 50 degrees Celsius is the second highest.""Easterly winds, which bring moisture to Delhi-NCR, have been prevailing in the city for the past two days. Due to moisture-laden winds, the relative humidity has increased and that's why the feel-like temperature was much higher than the actual temperature,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.However, the heat index is likely to increase on Friday and Saturday as IMD has predicted it to be around 54-56 degrees Celsius in the next 48 hours. ""The wind direction is expected to change to westerly by May 25 evening. The feel-like temperature may dip on Sunday,"" said a Met official.IMD's data shows that the heat index remained below 40 degrees Celsius for the entire April. Since it was low, IMD initially gave the range like 'below 40 degrees Celsius' or 'between 40-50 degrees Celsius' till May 12. It started giving the actual value from May 13. The heat index has remained below 50 on most days so far.As Delhi usually witnesses high humidity in July, the heat index may then rise above 50 degrees Celsius. ""Though it is too early to predict the feel-like temperature for July, the moisture levels are generally high in that month. Heat index is mostly higher than the actual temperature as it takes relative humidity into account,"" said another Met official. IMD will issue the heat index till mid-Aug.The index was introduced by IMD last year on an experimental basis. ""At present, heat index is derived using the heat index equation similar to what is used by National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA. It provides guidance towards additional care to be taken by people to reduce discomfort,"" Union minister of earth sciences Kiren Rijiju stated in a written reply in Rajya Sabha last July.","The heat index is the apparent temperature that people feel outside, an indication of the discomfort level.

and Bangladesh revealed that after the victim's demise, the perpetrator(s) dismembered the body inside one of the washrooms. After killing Anar, the group skinned the body, removed the flesh, and minced it to prevent identification. They then packed the remains into plastic bags and cut the bones into small pieces

The police suspect that after killing Anar, the murderers mutilated the body, segregated the flesh from the bones and mixed those with turmeric powder to delay decomposition.

The remains were then carefully placed into plastic bags for transportation. In an attempt to conceal any evidence of the heinous act, the washroom was thoroughly cleaned using acid before the apartment was vacated.

With help from Bangladeshi security agencies, CID detectives pieced together the events surrounding the murder.

Police suspect that the MP could have been ""lured' into a New Town flat by a woman and then murdered by contract killers.

They discovered that the plan to kill Azim, a representative of Jhenaidah-4 in Khulna division, was made at least a month before the incident.

The main suspect, businessman Md Akhtaruzzaman, also known as Shaheen, is the younger brother of the Kotchandpur Municipality mayor in Jhenaidah. Reports indicate that Shaheen paid contract killers 4 crore Bangladeshi taka to murder the MP.

The investigators have learnt that all the persons involved came from Bangladesh and returned to the country after finishing their job.

Some of them had checked into a hotel in Chinar Park a day before the murder and checked out on May 17 and left the country the same day

NEW DELHI: Investigations have uncovered bone- chilling details surrounding the disappearance and suspected murder of Anwarul Azim Anar , a member of parliament from Bangladesh , who had been missing since May 13 just a day after his arrival in Kolkata.According to the findings, the MP was allegedly killed in a Kolkata apartment, where his body was chopped and then proceeded to dispose the remains by packaging them in multiple plastic bags. Here's what we know so far:The search for the missing MP started when Gopal Biswas, who is a resident of Baranagar in north Kolkata and knows the Bangladeshi politician, reported to the local police. The MP had arrived in Kolkata on May 12 for medical treatment. Anar stayed at the house of Biswas when he arrived.Biswas mentioned in his complaint that Anar departed from his residence in Baranagar on May 13 afternoon to see a doctor. Anar informed that he would return home for dinner.Biswas claimed that the Member of Parliament from Bangladesh has been unreachable since May 17. This led him to report a missing complaint the following day.Also Read: Bangladesh MP Killed","Anwarul Azim Anar, a member of parliament from Bangladesh, had been missing since May 13.

Nasa launches sat to better climate change prediction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-launches-sat-to-better-climate-change-prediction/articleshow/110430998.cms,"A tiny Nasa satellite was launched Saturday from New Zealand with the mission of improving climate change prediction by measuring heat escaping from Earth's poles for the first time. ""This new information - and we've never had it before - will improve our ability to model what's happening in the poles, what's happening in climate,"" Nasa's earth sciences research director Karen St Germain told a news conference.

The satellite, which is the size of a shoe box, was launched by an Electron rocket, built by a company called Rocket Lab. The overall mission is called PREFIRE. It will serve to take infrared measurements far above the Arctic and Antarctic so as to measure directly the heat that the poles release into space. "" The process of getting the heat from the tropical regions to the polar regions is actually what drives all of our weather around the planet,"" said Tristan L'Ecuyer, a mission researcher affiliated with the University of Wisconsin, Madison. With PREFIRE, Nasa aims to understand how clouds, humidity or the melting of ice into water affects this heat loss from the poles.

Until now the models that climate change scientists used to gauge heat loss were based on theories rather than real observations, said L'Ecuyer.

Small satellites like this one are low-cost ""specialitsts"" that will answer very specific scientific questions, said St Germain.

So, today's news about Shaheen declining the vice-captaincy came as a big shock to the selectors,"" he said.However, it was revealed that in March, a selector, acting in his personal capacity, had asked Afridi if he would be interested in the vice-captaincy in the future. The pacer, however, declined the offer outright.It was not surprising either because by that time it was obvious that Babar was going to replace him as the T20 captain after just one series.On Saturday, several reports suggested that the offer of the vice-captaincy was made to Afridi earlier this week.The source termed it as an effort by some outside elements to tarnish the image of PCB and selectors.""Shaheen was obviously not happy when his captaincy term was cut short after he captained in just one series in New Zealand in January,"" he said.","Shaheen Shah Afridi was not offered the vice-captaincy role ahead of the T20 World Cup in the Americas.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Aftermath and safety protocols

Investigations and future precautions

A Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore encountered severe turbulence, causing a rapid ascent and descent of 400 feet within a minute, resulting in the death of one passenger and injuries to at least 30 others. The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

"Baltimore as US overdose capital: Almost 6,ooo dead in 6 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/baltimore-as-us-overdose-capital-almost-6ooo-dead-in-6years/articleshow/110430718.cms,"BALTIMORE: Across the city, the death toll has mounted. Fatal drug overdoses have occurred on one-third of the city's blocks. Bodies have been found in motels and vacant houses, at parks and the football stadium, around the corner from City Hall and outside the health department. In one grim month alone, 114 people succumbed. People in Baltimore have been dying of overdoses at a rate never before seen in a major US city.In the past six years, nearly 6,000 lives have been lost. The death rate from 2018 to 2022 was nearly double that of any other large city in the US.A decade ago, 700 fewer people here were being killed by drugs each year. And when fatalities began to rise from the synthetic opioid fentanyl, so potent that even minuscule doses are deadly, Baltimore's initial response was hailed as a national model. The city set ambitious goals, distributed Narcan (an over-the-counter drug to treat overdose) widely, experimented with ways to steer people into treatment and ratcheted up campaigns to alert the public.But then city leaders became preoccupied with other crises, including gun violence and the pandemic, and many of those efforts to fight overdoses stalled, an examination by The New York Times and The Baltimore Banner has found.Those who lost lives include a cross-section of Baltimore: line cook, lawyer, bus driver, engineer, machinist, teacher, restaurant owner, carpenter, veteran, physician, salesperson and admissions coordinator for an addiction recovery center. There were retirees and the jobless.Some victims were heartbreakingly young: Since 2020, at least 13 children younger than 4 have died after being exposed to drugs, according to the reports. Black men in their 50s to 70s died at the highest rates. A few overdose deaths drew headlines, but most were invisible to the public.For nearly all of the past three decades, Baltimore has had one of the highest fatal overdose rates of any large US city. But for most of that period, the death rate was much closer to the national average than it is today.Beginning in 2006, pharmaceutical companies were inundating pharmacies across the country with addictive pain pills Some patients began selling their pills in Baltimore expanding the illegal drug market. The mayor wrote last week that the current fentanyl crisis had been triggered by the influx of pills from drugmakers and distributors. But the prescription pill epidemic was far less severe in Baltimore than elsewhere in the country. Oxycodone was the cause of relatively few deaths in the city, according to CDC and state data.The death rate remained relatively low until the mid-2010s, when fentanyl flooded illegal drug markets across the country. Dealers began spiking heroin with fentanyl, which is up to 50 times more potent and can be manufactured from cheap chemical compounds. They also began mixing fentanyl in cocaine, pressing it into fake prescription pills and selling it on its own. Drug-testing data shows that it is now all but impossible to buy illegal opioids in Maryland that have not been mixed with it and other dangerous additives like xylazine, which makes naloxone - the generic name for Narcan - less effective. These days, heroin is rarely found.Because fentanyl is combined with other substances, the distribution of the opioid's granules is uneven. One hit may be just enough to get high. The next could be deadly.","In the past six years, nearly 6,000 lives have been lost. The death rate from 2018 to 2022 was nearly double that of any other large city in the US.

Despite being stored in a freezer for a month and a half, the meat was inadvertently served rare due to its darker color. After noticing the meat was undercooked, it was recooked and served again, CBS News reported.Nine family members, mainly from Minnesota but also from South Dakota and Arizona, partook in the meal, with some only consuming the accompanying vegetables.

Boeing to launch starliner with crew without repairing gas leak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-to-launch-starliner-with-crew-despite-helium-leak/articleshow/110420564.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Boeing is planning to launch its first crewed space mission in June without repairing a minor helium gas leak on its Starliner spacecraft , officials announced on Friday.The Starliner, in development since 2010, has faced numerous technical issues and is yet to fulfill its intended role of transporting astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). In the meantime, Boeing's competitor, SpaceX, has advanced with its Crew Dragon capsule.The Starliner was scheduled to take astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS on May 6. However, the mission was postponed just hours before launch due to a faulty valve on the United Launch Alliance rocket.Subsequent inspections revealed additional issues, including a helium leak in the spacecraft's service module, which contains the propulsion system. While the rocket valve has been replaced, Boeing and Nasa have decided to proceed with the ISS mission without fixing a small seal on a leaking joint.Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said that the leak is manageable even if the leak rate increases significantly. The issue affects one of 28 thrusters used to control the spacecraft's attitude. The team plans to monitor the leak closely in the hours leading up to the launch, set for June 1 at 12:25 pm from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.Mark Nappi, Boeing's vice president for the commercial crew program, explained that replacing the seal would be complex and require dismantling the Starliner at its factory. Stich noted that it is not unusual to fly with minor leaks, citing similar instances with space shuttles and SpaceX's Dragon.This mission is critical for Boeing as the company faces challenges within its commercial aviation division. Nasa aims to certify a second commercial vehicle for crew transport to the ISS, a goal set since the last space shuttle mission in 2011. A successful Starliner mission could help overcome the program's past setbacks.In 2019, a software defect during an uncrewed test flight prevented the capsule from reaching the ISS. A second software issue could have caused a catastrophic collision but was corrected in time. In 2021, blocked valves forced another postponement while the rocket was on the launchpad.The Starliner finally reached the ISS in May 2022 during a non-crewed launch. However, other issues, including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin, have caused further delays to the crewed test flight.",Boeing is planning to launch its first crewed space mission in June without repairing a minor helium gas leak on its Starliner spacecraft.

Implementation of all IMF conditions, experts believe,would put an extraordinary burden on the people, and some conditions carry implications for bilateral relations as well.“Based on the preliminary findings of this mission, staff will prepare a report that,subject to management approval, will be presented to IMF’s executive board for discussion and decision,” said Nathan Porter, the IMF mission’s chief, ahead of leaving Islamabad.Porter said Pakistan would have to continue progress towards low and stable inflation by appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies; improve public service provision through state-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring and privatisation; and promote private sector development by securing a level-playing field for investment and stronger governance.The IMF mission had quietly landed in Pakistan on May 10 and held meetings with Pakistani authorities and other key stakeholders, including US ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome.Pakistan’s incumbent govt is struggling to maintain economic stability amid rising political temperatures.

How Rishi Sunak’s small circle forged vote plan that shocked cabinet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-rishi-sunaks-small-circle-forged-vote-plan-that-shocked-cabinet/articleshow/110424814.cms,"LONDON: Rishi Sunak gave his most senior ministers little more than an hour’s notice of what he was about to tell the country and had already told King Charles III, that he had decided to call a snap UK general election for July 4.Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt was among those caught unaware. Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who’d had to cancel a visit to Albania just to make the meeting in Downing Street, expressed surprise, but said the decision “seizes the initiative, sets the agenda and forces the choice,” according to people familiar with the conversation.Others were less convinced. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps shared reservations, the people said. Detecting the shock later in a meeting of the full Cabinet, Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho — a Sunak loyalist since their Treasury days — intervened to say the premier wasn’t a politician who follows the consensus, whether on Brexit, pandemic lockdowns or net zero. Communities Secretary Michael Gove praised the move, quoting the Special Air Service motto: “Who dares wins.”Rishi Sunak kept his decision to call an early general election from all but a select few until just before his rain-soaked announcement outside Downing Street.Sunak ultimately headed into a downpour in Downing Street to speak the cameras. But the fact he presented it as a fait accompli signed off by the monarch, which the people said he did to ensure ministers couldn’t make him change his mind, underscores the scale of the gamble he knew he was taking. Little more than 48 hours later, Gove had joined the scores of Tory MPs announcing that they were standing down after the election.Spokespeople for Sunak, Cameron, Shapps, Hunt and Coutinho declined to comment.The announcement was weeks in the making, and piecing together how it came about reveals that it’s not only the Cabinet with reservations. The premier’s closest aides argued opposing sides, and, while people familiar with the matter say everyone is now on the same page, some still don’t want to be seen as responsible for pushing the snap election idea.It’s far from the ideal basis for what will be a bruising six-week campaign against Keir Starmer’s poll-leading opposition Labour Party. He’s already faced criticism for a presidential style that leaves little room for other Tory voices. If he doesn’t deliver on his strategy to narrow the poll gap early in the campaign, the recriminations will likely engulf him alone.Sunak’s gamble on a summer election on Wednesday stunned British politics. Prime ministers don’t go to the polls when they’re tailing by 20 points, as the Tories are, unless forced to. Sunak could have waited until as late as January, but was widely likely expected to call an election in the autumn to allow more time for voters to notice the UK’s gradual economic recovery.Outside of Cabinet, Tory MPs are openly critical. Going to the polls now instead of holding out hope for a Starmer slip-up has, they say, cemented a defeat. A stuttering campaign, including the drenched launch on Wednesday and the awkward clip of Sunak in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast on Friday, have reinforced the sense that it’s all been a bit rushed.“This is surprising given he had the advantage of deciding when to call the election,” said Will Jennings, associate dean at Southampton University. “He is deeply unpopular with the public, and polls suggest considerable public appetite for change. Turning things around would require something truly dramatic.”The timing has had a tangible impact. Sunak’s signature plan to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda, which the Tories regard as critical to holding off the right-wing Reform UK party, will not begin until after the election. The government also ran out of time to get a landmark smoking ban, predicted to be one of Sunak’s main achievements in office, through Parliament.That’s just the first few days of campaigning. Conflicting briefings by advisers about who was responsible for the snap election idea add to the dangerous backdrop for the weeks ahead.The premier’s inner circle of his 10 or so closest confidants had privately been considering an early election as far back as the turn of the year, people familiar with the matter said. Their “Plan A” had been to use tax breaks, falling inflation and interest rate cuts to hold the vote in the autumn, a strategy devised by the Tory campaign chief Isaac Levido.Yet a “Plan B” was kept on the table: a possible snap election if the right moment presented itself. The idea was discussed seriously in February, though some senior aides were strongly opposed.Around the beginning of April, the thinking began to shift toward a summer vote, people close to Sunak said. That set off weeks of agonizing conversations, with most aides recognizing the choice was far from clearcut. Some vacillated as they weighed the merits of waiting for an improvement against the risk of Tory support tanking further.Sunak himself was the driving force for a snap election, people familiar with the matter said. The premier and his chief of staff, Liam Booth-Smith, had become frustrated that nothing the government did, such as tax cuts at two successive fiscal events, was moving the polls.It was also increasingly clear that more tax cuts, which were part of the plan for an autumn election, were not doable. That reinforced their view that the polls were not going to shift until they called the election, people familiar with their thinking said, at which point they would become less of a referendum on the Tories’ record in office, and more a decision about the future.That’s a line that Sunak started using days before his election announcement.Another key factor in Sunak’s thinking was the expectation that inflation would fall back toward the Bank of England’s 2% target in the summer.By around the end of April, Sunak’s decision was coming into view, the people said. He was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. Levido and James Forsyth, Sunak’s close friend and adviser, were eventually convinced.Over the next six weeks, Sunak and his aides will find out if they were right. They are planning imminent manifesto announcements to try to demonstrate, per the Tory election slogan, that Sunak is willing to take “bold action.”Yet some Tories are starting the blame game early, unconvinced that Sunak’s team has hit on a winning formula. Meanwhile close to 80 Conservative MPs have said they’re calling it quits at the election — more than before Labour’s 1997 landslide victory — a number that is expected to keep on rising.","Rishi Sunak kept his decision to call an early general election from all but a select few until just before his rain-soaked announcement outside Downing Street.

I am told that Kate’s diary for this year is empty. There is nothing planned.

Her close relationship with her parents suggests they may visit during this time.Meanwhile, William is planning to prioritise spending more time with his family over the next six weeks, as the royal family announced their intention to reduce engagements to avoid distraction from an upcoming snap UK general election scheduled for July 4.Addressing concerns about conspiracy theories and speculation due to her prolonged absence, another source suggested that there is the possibility of releasing another video message updating the country on her health to counter such narratives, reported The Daily Beast.The Princess of Wales was last seen on Christmas Day at the Royal Family's annual service in Sandringham where she was pictured smiling with her husband and the rest of her family.It has been five months since Kate was last seen in public but the palace tried to keep updating about her through the photos. On Mother's day, Kensington Palace releases a photo of Kate surrounded by her three children to mark Mother's Day. However, the 'edited' photos didn't go well with the media and later she apologised for the same.Kate disclosed her cancer diagnosis in a video message on March 22, revealing that initial tests following successful abdominal surgery in January had confirmed the presence of cancer, although the specific type was not specified.","The Princess of Wales was last seen on Christmas Day at the Royal Family's annual service in Sandringham.

Fuel poverty is defined as being unable to afford to heat homes to temperatures needed to stay warm and healthy.About 28 million customers are on standard rate tariffs covered by the price cap, which was introduced in 2019 to protect consumers.The cap is set using factors such as network fees and social and environmental costs as well as wholesale energy prices.

The home office will instead focus on regulating agents that recruit international students and bring out tougher compliance standards for institutions recruiting them.It announced Thursday that would it accept the findings of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), published last week, which said the graduate route should not be scrapped.Rogue agents recruiting international students will have their business model “smashed” and universities which do not meet tougher compliance standards risk having their sponsor licence revoked, it said.That includes universities which accept international students who fail to pass visa checks, or enrol or complete their courses.Financial maintenance requirements will be raised, and English language assessments are being reviewed. Restrictions on remote delivery of courses are also being introduced. The route will “remain under review” owing to concerns “it is not attracting the highest earners” after analysis showed a large number ended up on low incomes.A home office spokesperson told TOI: “Govt has accepted all the MAC’s recommendations and introduced more measures to curb fraudulent activities, ensure only genuine students enter the visa system and hold universities accountable for their recruitment process.”In the year ending March 2024, 116,455 Indians were granted student visas.National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK chair Sanam Arora said: “We are delighted and very relieved that the UK govt has taken the right decision.

Indians made up highest number of immigrants to Britain last year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/indians-made-up-highest-number-of-immigrants-to-britain-last-year/articleshow/110373355.cms,"LONDON: Indians made up the highest number of people — 250,000 — to immigrate to Britain in 2023. Of these, 127,000 Indians came to work and 115,000 Indians came to study, and 9,000 came for other reasons. The next largest nationality to immigrate were Nigerian (141,000), Chinese (90,000), and Pakistani (83,000).Net migration to the UK fell 10% last year to 685,000 after hitting a record high in 2022 of 764,000, the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show. In UK, foreigners arriving to study or work are also counted in immigration numbers.Of these, 85% were none-EU arrivals, in sharp contrast to pre-2021 when EU nationals made up the largest component of long-term immigration.The main reason for immigration to the UK among non-EU nationals is now work, rather than study; 423,000 non-EU nationalscame to UK to work in the year ending Dec 2023, an increase of 53% from the year before when there were 277,000. Of these, 219,000 weredependant applicants and 204,000 were for main applicants, meaning the number of non-EU nationals arriving as dependants of those on long-term work visas has overtaken the number of main applicants.

Inside Rishi Sunak’s Hail-Mary plan to win UK general election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/inside-rishi-sunaks-hail-mary-plan-to-win-uk-general-election/articleshow/110370779.cms,"Rishi Sunak said he would begin deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda in the days after the general election on July 4 if he’s still prime minister, setting out his core message for the six-week campaign to try to keep Keir Starmer ’s poll-leading Labour Party from taking power.“If I’m elected, we will get the flights off,” Sunak told LBC Radio early Thursday, hours after surprising his Conservative Party by calling a snap vote almost everyone expected in the autumn. Pressed further on timing, he said: “No, after the election. The preparation work has already gone on.”With polls putting Labour 20 points ahead or more, the campaign battle lines are rapidly taking shape. For Starmer’s party, it’s about underscoring the turmoil of the Conservative Party’s 14-year record in office, via Brexit, the pandemic, Liz Truss and an historic cost-of-living crisis. The Labour leader is tapping into voters’ demand for change, while emphasizing a return to stability and what he calls a “politics that treads lighter on people’s lives.”Faced with skepticism about achieving anything more than damage limitation, Sunak is taking a starkly different approach. He wants voters to look past the turmoil and focus on improving economic data to imagine better times ahead. But he’s also talking up various domestic and geopolitical risks, adopting a Tory attack line from past elections that the UK would be less safe under Labour.People familiar with Sunak’s campaign plans said his focus on Rwanda during a morning broadcast round on Thursday was no accident — despite the awkward acknowledgment that deportation flights would not come before the vote.The prime minister is trying to frame the election as a choice between deportation flights under the Tories or a Labour government scrapping what Sunak regards as a key deterrent, a senior Conservative official told Bloomberg, speaking on condition of anonymity discussing campaign strategy.Sunak has long tried to present himself as tough on migration to try to win over voters attracted to the right-wing Reform UK, which is making inroads in districts the Conservatives desperately wanted to hold onto. Sunak got a boost Thursday when Reform’s founder Nigel Farage said he wouldn’t be a candidate — something Tory strategists feared would trigger a wipeout for their party.The aim now is to try to capitalize. Sunak’s team will use the opening campaign days to tell voters that with Farage out of the picture, Reform is not a serious force in British politics, people familiar with their strategy said.Conservative campaigners led by election chief Isaac Levido hope that repeating that message for two weeks will win back votes lost to Reform, eating into Labour’s poll lead and building momentum up to polling day, the people said.Reform UK leader Richard Tice accused Sunak of running scared over the threat posed by his party, saying he’d “bottled it” by calling an early vote.Using the promise of Rwanda flights immediately after the election was a key factor in the decision to call the surprise summer election, the people said. Over a month ago, Sunak aides pushing for a snap vote had proposed a slogan based on Rwanda deportation flights starting under Sunak and stopping under Starmer, Bloomberg reported at the time. Home Secretary James Cleverly used that line at a campaign event after Sunak called the election on Wednesday.To be sure, with Labour well ahead in opinion polls and against a backdrop of more asylum-seekers crossing the English Channel so far this year, other Tories question whether Sunak’s team has found a winning strategy. One aide said it seemed more like an attempt to reduce the scale of the defeat.Katie Hile, who worked under Sunak at the Treasury as a former head of economy and public spending communications, told Bloomberg Radio the prime minister’s strategy will likely be similar to the Tory leadership contest in 2022, when he lost out to Truss but narrowed her lead as the campaign went on. “He’ll take a similar approach of being the candidate of stability,” she said.Statistics published Thursday also illustrated the challenge facing Sunak to build a campaign around tackling migration. While net migration to the UK did fall from a record last year, it was still at an historically high level. Reform will use that to accuse the Tories of broken promises on migration dating back to 2010.In his own event, Starmer tore into Sunak’s migration lines. He said Labour’s focus would be on tackling the gangs arranging the migrant crossings, and accused the prime minister of misleading the public on his Rwanda plan.“Rishi Sunak clearly does not believe in his Rwanda plan,” Starmer told supporters in Kent, where Labour is targeting seats where the migration issue is prominent. “He’s not going to get any flights off. He has called an election early enough to have it not tested before the election.”Despite the prime minister’s bullishness on Rwanda, he cut a frustrated figure during a morning broadcast round when challenged on his decision to call an early election. Sunak said the moment was right because of economic data showing a decline in inflation to 2.3% and steady growth figures.He also defended his move to announce the election in the pouring rain, which was criticized by colleagues and generated a slew of negative newspaper front pages. “I’m not a fair weather politician,” Sunak said on BBC Radio 4, trying to make light of what many saw as a disastrous campaign launch.Still, Sunak will likely see the absence of Farage as a significant win. Had the Brexit campaigner entered the fray, the flow of Tory voters to Reform would likely have accelerated. For months, there has been the suggestion that Farage was enjoying mocking the Conservatives but that his real interest lies in helping Donald Trump become US president again. On Thursday, he made that official.",Rishi Sunak said he would begin deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda in the days after the general election on July 4 if he’s still prime minister.

STRESA: G7 finance ministers are expected Saturday to agree a broad plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine , paving the way for a potential agreement among leaders next month.The challenge of finding more funds for Ukraine as it battles fresh territorial advances by Russia after more than two years of war has dominated a meeting of finance ministers from the world's richest democracies in the northern Italian city of Stresa.The meeting comes as Kyiv said it had ""stopped"" the Russian advance in the Kharkiv region but Ukraine's General Staff admitted Saturday ""the enemy has partial success"" and said ""the situation is tense"" as fighting continued.President Volodymyr Zelensky has increased appeals for help as his army has struggled.Washington on Friday announced a fresh $275 million package of military aid for Kyiv.And Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko was to attend Saturday's G7 meeting in Stresa seeking to tap interest from frozen Russian assets.Any detailed agreement would require the approval of G7 leaders, who meet next month in Puglia, but observers have suggested that a deal ""in principle"" could be agreed on Saturday.""We need to reach a declaration of principle that marks the overall agreement of the G7 countries to use revenues from Russian assets to finance Ukraine,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.He said ministers aim to ""reach a political agreement in principle, not a turnkey solution"".The European Union's economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, also expressed cautious optimism, saying there was ""a positive convergence"" at the talks towards the concept of tapping profits from frozen Russian assets.Calls have mounted this year in the West to set up a fund for Ukraine using billions of dollars in bank accounts, investments and other assets frozen since Russia's 2022 invasion.Noting there remained ""many details yet to be clarified"", Gentiloni said the discussions ""may lead to an agreement"" at the G7 summit in Puglia on June 13-15.Italian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, too, said he and his counterparts were eyeing ""the basis for a solution for the mid-June summit"".The EU this week formally approved a plan to use interest from Russian assets frozen by the bloc in what it estimates could generate up to three billion euros a year for Ukraine.But the United States has maintained that G7 countries can go further, with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging ministers to consider ""more ambitious options"".The US idea would involve the creation of a $50 billion loan facility for Ukraine backed by future interest generated by the frozen Russian assets.While it would provide a bigger boost to Ukraine, the proposal has raised questions, including who would issue the debt, how risk would be shared between the United States and other G7 nations, and how interest rates could evolve.""We're not going to talk about amounts,"" Le Maire said. ""I think we need to talk about method first.""In February, the United States argued that G7 nations should seize the frozen assets outright, an idea it later backed away from due to the concern of allies that it could be a dangerous legal precedent and that Russia could retaliate.","G7 finance ministers expected to agree a broad plan to use interest from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine.

We’re ready to help India build more N-reactors: Russian nuclear agency chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/were-ready-to-help-india-build-more-n-reactors-russian-nuclear-agency-chief/articleshow/110411107.cms,"New Delhi: In order to expand nuclear cooperation, Russia is ready to help India with the construction of high-capacity nuclear power units at a new site, in addition to the atomic power project at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, Alexey Likhachev, head of the Russian nuclear agency , said on Thursday. He also said that India will get next-generation nuclear fuel this summer.Alexey Likhachev, director general of the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation, made the offer during a meeting with Atomic Energy Commission chairman Ajit Kumar Mohanty at Seversk in Russia. Leaders of Russia and India nuclear industries visited the site of the pilot demonstration energy complex (PDEC) being built in Seversk, Tomsk region, as a part of “Proryv” (“Breakthrough”) strategic industry project. The Russian Atomic Chief showed Mohanty the fourth-generation site that will host the safest atomic reactor in history, RT-India reported.
