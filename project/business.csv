Seeking a lasting solution

Connected care

Nearly a decade ago, K R Balakrishnan, a heart-lung transplant surgeon in Chennai, and Pete Ayre, a bioengineering professor at University of New South Wales, met for dinner in a Chennai hotel. When the discussion turned to artificial heart pumps , they borrowed pencils from the waiter and scribbled some designs on paper napkins.Soon, the drawings from the dining table made it to labs and, in five years, out came some prototypes.A couple of them — one for the left side of the heart and a smaller one for the right — are now being tested in sheep in Australia. If things go as planned, the team — it has patented the technology — will start clinical trials on humans in India and Australia by Dec 2024.“We never thought we’d get this far,” said Balakrishnan, who heads the heart and lung transplant department at MGM Healthcare. “Our discussion started casually. When I left the hotel, I never thought anything would come of it. I was surprised when Pete called me a week later, and things started happening.” The two have founded a company called Cardiobionic .Their plan was simple: To build a heart pump that would be a long-term and affordable solution to heart failure . Heart pumps available in the market now cost US$100,000 (more than 80 lakh). The team wanted to make one that cost one-fourth of that. “The ones available now are bulky, almost the size of a cricket ball,” said Ayre. “While surgeons may place pumps outside the chest cavity, it is not suitable for petite people and children.”Moreover, pumps today support only one chamber of the heart, the left ventricle. Several people who are given these pumps end up in intensive care for life support when the right side of the heart fails.But just when laboratory studies and designs began to show promise, the team hit its first roadblock. “We needed funds,” said Balakrishnan. “I spoke to more than 50 businessmen from across the world. Two Indian investors, whose details I cannot reveal now, agreed to invest. That’s when the project took off.”In five years, they developed a bi-ventricular assist pump that supports both sides of the heart with one console and a smaller device, which would cost about a fourth of the existing device.The pump is made of titanium and inside there’s a non-contact impella — a device that pulls blood from the ventricle and pushes it out into the aorta, delivering oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body. “It floats on blood and spins continuously. That means it may be a permanent solution and not just a bridge to a transplant,” said Ayre.Several heart failure patients across the country die waiting for an organ. “There are many hurdles in organ transplant. With better awareness, we are getting organs from brain-dead patients. But not all hearts are utilised because we don’t have the network to transport them within its shelf life of four hours. In most parts of the world there are no programmes for heart transplant,” he said. “This pump could prevent many deaths.”A smaller pump that supports the right side of the heart in adults can be used as an LVAD, or left ventricular assist device, for a child. “There are no pumps specifically for children now,” said Balakrishnan. However, more research is needed to understand why some hearts fail despite having an artificial pump.The team, meanwhile, is working to convert the pump into a remote monitoring device so that patients can be tracked from anywhere using the internet. They are also looking to make the entire system wireless. “Now, we have a driveline that connects the implanted pump to an external console via a cable across the skin. This can increase chances of infection,” he said.Doctors are pushing the team to make the pump work as efficiently as the human heart. “The heart can increase output by up to 50% during pregnancy, exercise, or emergency. We want to build pressure sensors that help the pump do this,” Ayre said.While the trials in Australian sheep are showing promise, the team is trying for product approval in India, US and Europe.","K R Balakrishnan, a heart-lung transplant surgeon in Chennai, and Pete Ayre, a bioengineering professor at University of New South Wales, met for dinner in a Chennai hotel.

"Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Mark Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs on why companies are making job cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-satya-nadella-mark-zuckerberg-and-other-tech-ceos-on-why-companies-are-making-job-cuts/articleshow/111560240.cms,"Meta’s move towards “year of efficiency”

Job cuts due to “different economic reality”: Google CEO Sundar Pichai

Job cuts at Microsoft for restructuring and investments in key areas

Layoffs at IBM, Salesforce and other companies

The tech industry's layoffs haven't stopped. After starting in 2023, many companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta and Amazon, among others, are still cutting jobs in 2024. Recently, Microsoft laid off a bunch of people in product and program management roles, impacting multiple teams and geographies. Notably, despite these cuts, major tech companies keep releasing new artificial intelligence (AI) features and products.Here we have listed a few reasons that CEOs of these tech giants have provided for job cuts .The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is among the first tech giants that announced job cuts. On the first round of industry-wide layoffs, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview with “Morning Brew Daily” in February that the company overhired during the pandemic and later realised the benefits of a leaner workforce, leading to more layoffs.Thousands of employees were laid off in Zuckerberg's “year of efficiency,” in 2023.""It was obviously really tough. We parted with a lot of talented people we cared about. But in some ways, actually becoming leaner kind of makes the company more effective,” Zuckerberg said in the interview. (via Business Insider)For Google there are multiple reasons, and also conducted multiple rounds of layoffs, with most recent being in its Cloud unit at the end of May.In 2023, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company experienced “dramatic growth” during the pandemic, leading to hiring “for a different economic reality” than what was last year. Then in May this year, Pichai told Bloomberg that the company is removing some teams completely to “improve velocity.”He pointed out that the first half of the year will see more job cuts, which will be at a slower pace in the second half.He noted that the company is also “reallocating people” to its “highest priorities”, which include AI projects, like the creation of ARM-based CPUs, development as well as implementation of Gemini across Google and Google Workspace apps.Google isn't the only one to restructure its workforce to make room for AI – its AI rival Microsoft also has ‘blamed’ the new technology for job cuts.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a memo last year said the company while consumers are also optimising their digital spends, the onset of new technology is forcing the company to take such a stand.“First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we're now seeing them optimise their digital spend to do more with less. At the same time, the next major wave of computing is being born with advances in AI, as we're turning the world's most advanced models into a new computing platform,” Nadella said, adding that the company will continue to hire in “key strategic areas.”In May 2023, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna predicted AI and automation replacing 30% of HR and non-customer facing roles within five years. The company laid off employees in March 2024.Discord CEO Jason Citron mentioned in a January memo that the company's workforce had grown five times since 2020 – which may be linked to recent layoffs.Just like Zuckerberg, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff blamed over-hiring during the pandemic for layoffs in 2023. He stated revenue grew, but the economic downturn required a smaller workforce.Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, in a 2023 layoff announcement, said their next phase needed a different skill set focused on AI and early-stage product development.","Google, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta and Amazon, among others, are still cutting jobs in 2024.

Religious imbalance

'

NEW DELHI: RSS-linked magazine Organiser Weekly , in its latest edition, may have echoed the concerns of opposition on the possible adverse political impact of delimitation on the southern states - which Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin had once described as a ""Damocles Sword"" hanging over the state.An editorial published in the magazine flags both regional and religious imbalances linked to population growth and demands a comprehensive national population control policy .""Regional imbalance is another critical dimension that will impact the delimitation process of the Parliamentary Constituencies in the future. The States from the West and South are doing relatively better regarding population control measures and, therefore, fear losing a few seats in Parliament if the base population is changed after the census . Hence, we need policies to ensure that population growth does not disproportionately impact any single religious community or region, which can lead to socio-economic disparities and political conflicts,"" the article titled ""Demography, Democracy and Destiny"" reads.This is exactly what the southern leaders fear post Census, which is likely to happen in the third term of PM Modi. Union home minister Amit Shah had in September last year asserted that census and delimitation will begin soon after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Delimitation means the process of fixing the number of seats and boundaries of territorial constituencies in each state for Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies based on the population as determined by the latest Census. It also includes determining seats to be reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in these houses. Article 82 and 170 of the Constitution provide that the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies as well as its division into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted after each Census.The first delimitation was done in 1952 following the 1951 census which fixed Lok Sabha seats to 494. The next one came in 1963 following the reorganisation of states in 1956, which saw the number of Lok Sabha seats go up to 522. The third and last delimitation, carried out in 1973, raised the number of Lok Sabha seats to 543, which remains till this day.The debate around delimitation began after the Women's Reservation Bill was passed by Parliament last year. The landmark Bill tied its implementation to the delimitation of the Lok Sabha and all state assembly constituencies based on the first Census data after the law was enacted.Several leaders of the south have voiced concern over losing political heft in Parliament after the process of delimitation. While Stalin had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allay the fears of southern states, K T Rama Rao, former minister of Telangana, had called for united action by all political parties of the south against the ""injustice"" being done through the process of delimitation.These leaders fear the north getting a bigger share of parliamentary constituencies because of their higher population density and the south losing its clout substantially because of effectively implementing population control measures.And while the article highlights the opposition's concerns on regional imbalance, it slams leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee for ignoring the perils of religious imbalance citing the growth of Muslim population in some states.""There is a significant Muslim population growth in certain areas, especially bordering districts. The bordering States of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Uttarakhand are witnessing unnatural population growth due to illegal migration across the borders. In a democracy, when numbers are critical regarding representation and demography decides the destiny, we must be even more cautious of this trend,"" the article reads.The article then goes on to slam some of the opposition leaders for their appeasement politics.""Politicians like Rahul Gandhi can afford to insult Hindu sentiments now and then, Mamata can play the blatant Muslim card even to accept the atrocities on women by the Islamists, and Dravidian parties can take pride in abusing the Sanatan Dharma only because of their confidence in the consolidation of so-called minority vote-bank developed with the population imbalance. Learning from the horrors of the Partition and what is happening with the politically correct but socially and culturally incorrect migration from West Asian and African countries, we have to address this issue urgently, as pointed out by various Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh resolutions and judicial pronouncements,"" it reads.","RSS-linked magazine Organiser Weekly may have echoed the concerns of opposition on the possible adverse political impact of delimitation on the southern states.

The IJMR study said unnecessary prescription of antibiotics in such a case increases the risk of antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions and the cost of treatment; thus, putting the prescription in the category of unacceptable deviation. An acceptable deviation would include incomplete prescriptions with respect to formulation, dose, duration and frequency.In the study, researchers analysed 4,838 prescriptions issued by doctors posted at the outpatient departments of tertiary care hospitals across the country where the 13 Indian Council of Medical Research Rational Use of Medicine Centres are located.All prescribers were post-graduates in their respective disciplines & on average were in practice for four to 18 years.Researchers found OPDs having maximum deviations was community medicine, followed by ENT & paediatrics. ""It's possible that deviations in community medicine were more as such OPDs are run by junior docs,"" the study stated.","Nearly one in every two prescriptions issued by doctors from top govt hospitals deviate from standard treatment guidelines.

The Nov 8, 2016, notification had allowed deposition of demonetised currency notes in banks till Dec 30, 2016.

The bench issued fresh notice to Axis Bank and asked it to respond within three weeks after RBI counsel said court would have to hear the bank and find out whether it had a valid reason not to accept the demonetised notes.

The PSS Central Institute of Vocational Education, a unit of NCERT, had developed comprehensive guidelines to make learning in schools more joyful, experiential and stress-free for students.“Various suggestions were discussed during the meeting, including sensitising students about the local ecology, teaching them to test water purity, recognising local flora and fauna and visiting local monuments. Based on this review, PSSCIVE will further finetune and finalise its guidelines,” a senior education ministry official said.National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommends that all students in Classes 6-8 participate in a 10-day bagless period. During this time, students will intern with local skill experts and engage in activities outside traditional school settings. This initiative aims to help students develop an appreciation for the larger ecosystem in which their school is embedded.“Bagless days will be encouraged throughout the year, encompassing a variety of activities such as arts, quizzes, sports and skill-based learning. Students will gain periodic exposure to activities outside the classroom, including visits to historical, cultural and tourist sites, interactions with local artists and craftsmen, and visits to various educational institutions within their village, tehsil, district or state, as mapped by local skilling needs,” the official said.","National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommends that all students in Classes 6-8 participate in a 10-day bagless period.

""A national scheme would also add to inflationary pressures,"" they said in a note.The suggestion for a national scheme had intensified after Congress promised Rs 8,500 monthly payment in the just concluded general elections.Andhra was the first off the block announcing a scheme in Jan 2020, followed by Assam in Feb 2021 and Himachal and Delhi announcing similar schemes earlier this year. Delhi is likely to roll out the income transfer scheme for women later this year, ahead of assembly polls in early 2025.

Even in quantity, there has been a 45% increase in import of crude last year compared to 2022-23.Officials said the import of fertiliser from Russia helped govt to ensure enough availability of the soil nutrient during the Covid-19 pandemic when the global supply chain was disrupted. Indian companies have continued importing the soil nutrients from the country even after the war in Ukraine and insulated farmers from additional financial burden.The PM's remarks come a day after the United States raised concerns with India about its relationship with Russia. Govt is also looking at the option to increase the import of muriate of potash (MOP) from Russia as the Red Sea crisis continues and has pushed up freight charges for fertilisers imported from Jordan and Israel. Sources said talks are on with Russia and Belarus to import more MOP to meet any fall in shipment from the Middle East. Russia is the largest supplier of MOP to India.","Russia emerged as a major supplier of fertiliser to India with the import increasing by more than 300% in the past three years.

A joint statement said they would focus on increased supplies of goods from India to Russia to address the trade imbalance.While the agenda for the 22nd India-Russia summit was mostly economic, Modi also strongly sought from Putin the release of all Indian nationals serving in the Russian army .Foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra said there was a ""sense of promise"" from Russia on the early discharge of about 30-40 Indian nationals who are still there, after being ""misled"" into joining the Russian army.With the West keeping a wary eye and disappointed over New Delhi not cutting off economic engagements with Moscow, the two sides also signed nine agreement, including one for facilitation of investment by Russian companies in the Indian market. Modi thanked Putin for the continued supply of fertilisers to Indian farmers when the world was facing a crisis in the fuel and energy sector , saying it was because of Russia-India cooperation that India was able to provide for the needs of its citizens.Modi said the world should recognise that India-Russia cooperation in the energy sector ensured stability in the world market. ""In many countries of the world, people face problems with fuel, diesel, but thanks to our agreements with you in this area, in the energy sector, we were able to provide our citizens with fuel. And not only did we provide it, we were able to keep inflation under control and also ensured stability. For this I am very grateful to you,"" he told Putin.Kwatra said India was also looking at energy deals with Russian giants like Rosneft. ""The two leaders, when they spoke of cooperation in energy, they did focus on how exactly to strengthen that partnership... how exactly India in particular through the government-to-government route could also build partnerships with Rosneft and other energy entities,"" the foreign secretary said.While discussing regional and global issues, they expressed deep concern on the situation in Gaza and called for unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip, while also seeking immediate and unconditional release of hostages.On the Ukraine issue, the joint statement highlighted the imperative of peaceful resolution of the conflict ""around Ukraine"" through dialogue and diplomacy including engagement between both parties.Like in the past, the leaders unequivocally condemned terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including the cross-border movement of terrorists, and terrorism financing networks and safe havens. ""They strongly condemned the recent dastardly terrorist attack on an Army convoy in Kathua area of Jammu and Kashmir on July 8, in Dagestan on June 23 and on the Crocus City Hall in Moscow on March 22 and stressed that these terrorist attacks are a grim reminder for further strengthening cooperation to combat terrorism,"" said the joint statement.Modi also raised with the Russian President the need to address the delay in supply of spare parts for Russian-origin defence equipment.

BENGALURU: Flat owners in the city are demanding that the title deeds of the plots on which their apartments stand must be transferred in the name of their association, by way of executing a registered conveyance deed . They claim builders in Bengaluru and elsewhere in Karnataka are deliberately not doing so and this has created room for some promoters to mortgage the land or take up fresh construction activities, even after the passage of several years.Sections 11 and 17 of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act mandates the promoter or the builder should execute a registered conveyance deed of the undivided proportionate title in common areas to the association of allottees.This is required to be done within three months of getting the occupation certificate or the completion certificate.The flat owners were participating in a session organised by Bangalore City Flat Owners’ Association (BCFOWA), a not-for-profit organisation for apartment owners/ associations/ federations/ forums, to spread awareness on ownership, management and maintenance of apartments and properties. Over 30 members from different apartment associations were in attendance.Ganesh A, a flat owner from Uttarahalli, said: “We were first-time buyers of a flat so we weren’t aware of many things. I paid Rs 60 lakh to buy the flat. Except for the sale deed, we don’t have any other rights that talk about our ownership of the land. In the encumbrance certificate, my name is not shown; it actually scared me about ownership right on the flat I bought for a huge amount.”Bharathi Srivastava, a resident of an apartment complex in Whitefield, asked: “Without the conveyance of the title deed for the entire land, how can we ensure that fresh encumbrances aren’t created on the land?”Flat owners wonder why they are being fleeced in the name of common areas when the plot isn’t even in their name.Veena Shantharam Prabhu, who owns a flat in Mangaluru, shared: “The land isn’t in the name of our society and yet I pay maintenance charges every month for maintaining our common areas, which actually belong to the builder. When our association asked me to pay the maintenance, I asked for a registration certificate but they didn’t provide me any such document. Then I said I wouldn’t pay. So they cut off my water and electricity connection, and the matter is in court now.”",Flat owners are demanding that the title deeds of the plots on which their apartments stand must be transferred in the name of their association.

MUMBAI: Rains have made a comeback in a big way. At 268mm, India Meteorological Department’s ( IMD ) Santacruz observatory on Monday recorded the second-highest 24-hour rain in the month of July in the last 15 years, following an intense downpour of 170mm in a three-hour span post midnight.On Monday evening, IMD upgraded its weather alert for Mumbai and Raigad to ‘red’, indicating heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places.The ‘red’ alert is till Tuesday 8.30am.The 15-year highest rainfall for the month is 375.2mm on July 2, 2019, while the all-time record is 944.2 mm when Mumbai experienced a deluge on July 26, 2005.On Sunday night, IMD had issued a ‘yellow’ alert, indicating heavy rain activity at isolated places for 24 hours, but Mumbai saw intense downpour between 2.30am and 5.30am. An IMD official said that an offshore trough strengthened around 12.30am, bringing in the heavy rainfall. “There was no weather system in place to issue an orange or red alert . The rainfall activity was received in a very brief period,” said the official.IMD recordings show that till 2.30am, IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 40.9mm rain, which surged to 210.9mm by 5.30am. The remaining 57mm was recorded between 5.30am and 8.30am. In the morning, IMD upgraded its warning for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar to ‘orange’, indicating heavy to very heavy rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning and gusty winds at isolated places.

Top 11k ranks spread evenly across 800 NEET centres: NTA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-11k-ranks-spread-evenly-across-800-neet-centres-nta/articleshow/111588080.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) has said that only 175 candidates from 12 centres in Patna and eight from two Godhra centres managed to score 640 or above in the NEET-UG exam. None of the candidates from the Godhra centres under scrutiny scored 680 or above, and only 35 candidates from the Patna centres achieved this score, it said.Claiming there was no "" systemic leak "", agency officials told TOI that the top 1000, 5000 and 10,000 students were distributed across the 800-plus centres and were not necessarily from the cohort of centres under scrutiny.NTA said its data analysis did not indicate a ""larger leak"" beyond Patna. It also said the candidate whose test booklet was investigated scored just 103 marks. ""Roshni, whose booklet was confiscated by Bihar Police, scored 103 marks out of 720,"" an NTA official said.Agency officials claimed that data analysis of the top 11,000 ranks showed an even distribution across 800-plus centres. Explaining the analysis, an official said following the alleged leak, NTA examined not just the top scorers but also those beyond the top 100.""We looked into the scoring patterns for each group of thousand candidates and their distribution. For example, the top 1,000 candidates are spread across 800 centres,"" the official said. He added that the top 1 lakh candidates, who are most likely to secure MBBS or dental seats, are distributed across 4,500 of the 4,750 centres, debunking allegations that toppers were concentrated in specific centres. ""If we examine even smaller groups, such as the top 5,000 candidates, they too are distributed across 780 centres,"" he said.Over 13 lakh of the 23 lakh candidates who took the medical entrance test on May 5 qualified. The official argued that if there was widespread irregularities and access to question papers as alleged, the qualification average for Patna and Godhra would have been much higher. ""The qualifying average for Patna and Godhra are not only lower than the national average but also lower than their neighbouring cities and centres,"" the official said.Another concern raised by the petitioners and the SC was the significant increase in the number of perfect scorers.

"World's most expensive insect stag beetle living in garbage costs more than BMW, Audi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/worlds-most-expensive-insect-stag-beetle-living-in-garbage-costs-more-than-bmw-audi/articleshow/111594854.cms,"Interesting facts about stag beetle

Who can fly, male or female stag beetle?

Are stag beetle dangerous?

Have you ever thought that a bug living in the garbage could be as expensive as a BMW or Audi? There is an insect, Stag beetles which is the world’s most expensive insect , whose price can go as high as Rs 75 lakh easily.Merely two to three inches in size, Stage beetles are hard and also expensive to pet. According to the National History Museum , stag beetle numbers are dwindling across the Europe but the Thames Valley region, including London , is emerging as a haven for these impressive and uncommon insects.According to Max Barclay , Senior Curator in Charge of the Museum's beetle collection, ""Stag beetles are rare and threatened throughout northern Europe and the populations in the Thames Valley are some of the largest in the world. London is a particular stronghold.""Barclay emphasises that Londoners are fortunate to have these fascinating and attractive creatures residing in the city's parks and gardens. He encourages residents to create a welcoming environment for these gentle giants and take pride in sharing their living spaces with them.According to Google Trends, stag beetle is capturing significant attention as it is one of the spices which for conservation in the UK.The scientific name of the beetle is Lucanus cervus who are just 36-75 mm long (male) and 30-50mm (female), including mandibles/jaws. Their average life span is of just 3-7 year. These beetles don't eat, but they do drink sweet fluids such as tree sap and the liquid from decomposing fruit. They mostly rely on the energy stores they built up as a larva.Stag beetle larvae feed on dead wood, using their sharp jaws to scrape the fibrous surface for splinters. Wood infested with white rot is a particular favourite as it helps to decompose the wood. The larvae also digest any fungi and other organisms in the wood.As per the National History Museum, female stag beetles possess the ability to fly, with their flight wings concealed beneath their hardened outer wings, similar to most other beetle species. However, you're more likely to encounter them on the ground, searching for an appropriate location to deposit their eggs.These beetles have a tendency to revisit the site where they emerged from their own eggs to lay their brood, sometimes even selecting the same piece of wood. As Max points out, 'The females don't usually move very far unless they have to.'Male stag beetles are more frequently observed in flight, often at an alarming face-level height, which can be quite startling given their substantial size and awkward aerial maneuvers. Witnessing this spectacle is truly a remarkable experience.Stag beetles may look frightening, but they pose no threat to humans. It is perfectly safe to pick them up and relocate them if necessary.Although male stag beetles can slightly move their jaws to deliver a mild pinch, they will only do so if provoked. Females possess stronger jaws that are capable of biting, but they are not naturally aggressive.Max says, 'There really is no need to fear these beetles. They are not dangerous. I've never been bitten by one.'Rest assured, encountering a stag beetle is not a cause for alarm. These fascinating insects are harmless and can be appreciated from a safe distance or gently moved if they are in danger.This story has also been trending on Google Trends, showcasing the public's interest in knowing more about the expensive insects.(This is a highly searched topic on Google trends)","Stag beetle numbers are dwindling across the Europe but the Thames Valley region, including London, is emerging as a haven for these impressive and uncommon insects.

'Barcelona is not for sale': Mass anti-tourism protests erupt as living costs go into a tailspin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/barcelona-is-not-for-sale-mass-anti-tourism-protests-erupt-as-living-costs-go-on-a-tailspin/articleshow/111587604.cms,"Protesters in Barcelona have taken to spraying water on tourists as part of a demonstration against mass tourism . Demonstrators marched through tourist-heavy areas, chanting “tourists go home” and using water pistols, while others held signs saying “Barcelona is not for sale,” CNN reported.Thousands of people joined the protest in the latest outcry against mass tourism in Spain, which has seen similar demonstrations in the Canary Islands and Mallorca.Protesters argue that mass tourism drives up living costs and diminishes the quality of life for locals.The protest was organized by the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turístic (Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth), a coalition of over 100 local organizations. They argue that these tourists increase prices and strain public services, while the tourism industry profits are unfairly distributed, exacerbating social inequality.The group has put forward 13 proposals to reduce visitor numbers and transition to a new tourism model. These proposals include closing cruise ship terminals, increasing regulation of tourist accommodations, and ending public spending on tourism promotion.The discontent in Barcelona mirrors similar protests in other parts of Spain. In April, residents of the Canary Islands protested against excessive tourism, blaming it for making housing unaffordable and causing environmental harm. These issues are common in many popular tourist destinations worldwide, which have seen record visitor numbers as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic.While increased tourism can benefit local economies and hospitality businesses, it also brings significant drawbacks: more noise, pollution, traffic, resource strain, a lower quality of life for locals, and a diminished experience for visitors. Consequently, many tourist hotspots have introduced measures to combat overtourism, such as new or increased tourist taxes, campaigns to discourage problematic visitors, and attendance caps at popular attractions","Demonstrators march through tourist-heavy areas, chanting ‘tourists go home’ and using water pistols.

Quantum Computing Research: India's quantum computing research needs a boost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/times-techies/indias-quantum-computing-research-needs-a-boost/articleshow/111620020.cms,"With the union government’s ambitious Rs 6,000 crore National Quantum Mission to support the research and development of quantum technologies and applications, the state of quantum technology R&D in the country and how we compare with others has come to the fore.A recent report by Itihaasa, a nonprofit co-founded by Kris Gopalakrishnan, shows that India lags when it comes to publishing research papers on quantum technologies.Data analysis shows leading educational institutes and national labs in India have published 1,711 research papers on various quantum technologies between 2000 and 2018, ranking 10th globally. This pales in comparison to the US which ranks 1st with 13,489 papers and China which ranks 2nd with 12,100 papers.If only the top 10% of most cited papers are considered, then the US ranks first, China third, and India twentieth.On the patents front, Itihaasa’s analysis, based on machine learning, shows India stands at 9th with 339 patents in quantum technologies. China leads the pack with 23,335 patents, and the US stands 2nd with 8,935 patents to its kitty.N Dayasindhu, co-founder and chief executive of Itihaasa Research and Digital, said since the technology is in the developmental stage, and India has renewed its focus with the National Quantum Mission, it is possible for us to catch up.But he said the country’s quantum research should assess the local needs of the country and make sure the average citizen benefits from it. “Our focus should address the needs of the population -like finding treatment for a disease which may not be attractive for other countries,” he said.Dayasindu said the National Quantum Mission should prioritise building an ecosystem that includes constructing physical experimental facilities and labs, alongside training students and attracting global talent to jumpstart research and development in the country. “We have to ensure the research translational gap is plugged with the development of devices and products and licensing IPs.”He also stressed the need for central experimental facilities with lithography equipment for fabrication and testing centres.Bijoy Krishna Das, chief investigator of silicon photonics centre of excellence (CoE-CPPICS), said India is quickly catching up by learning from the existing scientific literature. He stressed the need for technical know-how in building quantum technologies for India to be a serious player in the field. “Tomorrow if the technology is ready, we still need foundries for fabricating devices and testing them. We are working with Malaysia-based semiconductor foundry SilTerra.”Das also said that a multi-disciplinary research approach is crucial in the field of quantum technologies. “Putting people together from different competencies to work, making a plan together, and creating an ecosystem are all challenges, but nevertheless needs to be done.”Sunil Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Qnu labs, a Bengaluru-based quantum cryptography startup, said he faced numerous difficulties in his early days when he founded the company in 2016. He said his initial job was evangelisation of the technology itself, rather than bringing commercial products to the market and thinking about product-market fit.The company now has three product offerings in quantum cybersecurity and works with government agencies like the Army and Navy, along with telecommunication and financial service companies and banks. They also have seven patents in the field of quantum technologies and are awaiting approval for a dozen more.Sunil Gupta said the demand for quantum-based cybersecurity products is coming from enterprises, apart from governmental agencies, and puts the quantum-based cybersecurity market size at $200 million in India, based on a study commissioned by the startup.","India has published 1,711 research papers on various quantum technologies between 2000 and 2018, ranking 10th globally.

Cognizant pays Rs 4 crore to settle Dalal's lawsuit with Wipro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cognizant-pays-rs-4-crore-to-settle-dalals-lawsuit-with-wipro/articleshow/111614819.cms,"BENGALURU: Cognizant has paid Rs 4 crore to its CFO, Jatin Dalal, to settle the lawsuit and related arbitration with his former employer, Wipro . Cognizant paid Dalal even though the company was not named in the order from the Bengaluru Civil Court in January, where he invoked his rights to an arbitral tribunal. Cognizant wasn’t named in the arbitration proceedings either.In its press release, Cognizant said that the terms of the settlement, which was reached without any admission of liability by either party, are confidential.It also mentioned that the settlement resolves all pending disputes between Dalal and Wipro. “The settlement was reached without admission of liability by either party. The company’s payment covers Dalal’s settlement payment to Wipro as well as reimbursement of his legal fees,” Cognizant said in a filing with the SEC on Tuesday.Wipro had sought Rs 25 crore from Dalal for breach of contract after he joined Cognizant as CFO immediately after leaving Wipro in November last year. The claim is based on the value of RSUs and PSUs granted to Dalal since he became CFO in 2015.The company had said in the court filing that every one of the grants came with the condition that for a period of 12 months after his last date of employment, Dalal could not directly or indirectly engage with a competitor, could not solicit a Wipro customer to move the existing business to another party, and could not solicit a Wipro employee to be associated with a competitor, supplier, or customer.""I am grateful for my journey with Wipro, and I am pleased to have this matter behind me. I’m looking forward to continuing to drive Cognizant’s growth agenda while delivering value to our clients, employees, and shareholders,” said Dalal in a statement. Saurabh Govil, president and CHRO at Wipro, said, “We are glad this issue has been resolved, safeguarding our contractual rights.” When TOI asked Wipro whether a compromise between Dalal and Wipro was reached, given that the settlement amount is much smaller compared to what Wipro had sought, the company didn't respond to TOI's queries.Some proxy advisory experts have said that this settlement has raised questions about whether it has set a certain precedent in the industry regarding non-compete contractual obligations. Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of the proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services, said it’s not clear why, in the arrangement between Wipro and Dalal, the settlement amount was reduced. “Wipro should inform its shareholders what the eventual settled amount is, in comparison to its claim over its erstwhile CFO.” Cognizant, Subramanian said, has set a bad precedent by poaching a senior executive of a rival company with explicit knowledge of a breach of contract in the non-compete and confidentiality arrangement. “By agreeing to pay the settlement amount, Cognizant has further set a precedent that contracts may be broken by the poaching company paying off the breakage amount. Cognizant would have been aware of the terms of Dalal’s employment contract. It would have taken a conscious decision to hire by breaking a contract, rather than wait out the contract period. Headhunters and search firms should advise their clients against such practices,” he said.In another development, Cognizant said it has entered a similar settlement regarding the lawsuit between Wipro and its former SVP and healthcare head, Mohammad Haque. Wipro moved court against Haque, who then sought arbitration. Wipro has filed a complaint against Haque for violating non-compete clauses in his employment contract by joining Wipro’s direct competitor, Cognizant.Haque took charge as the chief commercial officer at Cognizant on August 1 last year, and he cited that the new role involves a more expansive portfolio of responsibilities, the potential to earn more money, and more opportunity for growth. He relocated to California after taking up the new position with Cognizant. A US court filing on Monday showed that Wipro and Haque have agreed that all claims and causes of action have been amicably adjusted between the parties, and without costs.","Cognizant has paid Rs 4 crore to its CFO, Jatin Dalal, to settle the lawsuit and related arbitration with his former employer, Wipro.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"54-year-old woman, who received pig kidney transplant plus a heart pump, dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/54-year-old-woman-who-received-pig-kidney-transplant-plus-a-heart-pump-dies/articleshow/111621018.cms,"Lisa Pisano , a 54-year-old woman from New Jersey, passed away on Sunday after living for 47 days with a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig . She was the second person to receive such a transplant and was critically ill, suffering from both kidney and heart failure.Pisano underwent the transplant on April 12, just eight days after receiving a mechanical heart pump.Due to inadequate blood flow related to the heart pump, the pig kidney was damaged, and surgeons had to remove it on May 29. Following the explantation, Pisano resumed kidney dialysis but was eventually transitioned to hospice care. Her case was unique, as she was the first person with a heart pump known to have also received an organ transplant , as patients with kidney failure are usually ineligible for heart pumps due to the high risk of mortality.Dr Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, praised Pisano's contributions to the field of xenotransplantation, saying, ""Lisa's contributions to medicine, surgery and xenotransplantation cannot be overstated. Her bravery gave hope to thousands of people living with end-stage kidney or heart failure who could soon benefit from an alternative supply of organs.""Pisano's case follows that of Richard Slayman, 62, who was the first patient to receive a kidney from a genetically engineered pig in March at Mass General Brigham in Boston. Although Slayman was well enough to be discharged two weeks after the surgery, he, like Pisano, had complex medical problems and died within two months.Xenotransplantation has made significant progress in recent years, but the procedures remain experimental. Only patients who are too sick to receive a human organ and are at risk of dying without treatment have been approved to receive animal organs.Biotech companies are striving to address the dire shortage of transplantable organs in the United States, where over 100,000 individuals, primarily in need of a kidney, are on the waiting list. Tragically, many die before receiving a transplant. These companies are focusing on genetic modifications to pigs, aiming to create organs that more closely resemble human ones and reduce the likelihood of rejection by the recipient's immune system.","Lisa Pisano, 54, from New Jersey, passed away on Sunday.
