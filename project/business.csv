Miraj’s sitars find a home abroad but face an uncertain future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mirajs-sitars-find-a-home-abroad-but-face-an-uncertain-future/articleshow/118131011.cms,"The sitars of Miraj still sing. They resonate with the same depth of sound that once captivated the world through Pandit Ravi Shankar’s fingers, enchanted by Vilayat Khan’s mastery, and found an unexpected champion in George Harrison’s “Norwegian Wood”.. For now, the chisels still strike, the polish still gleams, and the strings still hum. But how much longer?The artisans of this small city in Maharashtra’s Sangli district have breathed life into the sitar for 300 years. Today, these same hands, calloused by generations of craftsmanship, struggle to hold on to a tradition that is more inheritance than profession.Inside the timeworn workshops in the narrow alleys of Miraj, the artisans stand at a crossroads. While the craft wavers at home, Miraj’s sitars are finding a market across the oceans. In US, Germany, and UK, musicians cherish the handcrafted instruments.The demand for these instruments is vast — greater than ever, in fact — but the hands that craft them are growing fewer. Where once thousands laboured, only a few hundred remain.Mohsin Mirajkar, a seventh-generation sitar maker, knows this struggle intimately. At 43, he has dedicated his life to carving, stringing, and tuning the instrument that defines his family’s legacy. Yet, he watches helplessly as younger generations turn away.“The effort it takes to make a sitar is immense,” he said. “With less effort, they can earn more in IT or engineering. The demand is huge, but we can’t even meet 25% of it.”The irony is stark. While the world craves the authentic voice of Miraj’s sitars, the very hands that shape them are forced to consider a future without them.“During the pandemic, only doctors and essential workers were in demand,” said Mohammed Saeem Shikalgar, a young sitar maker, who balances the art with his medical studies. “I love making sitars, but I needed a backup. If this tradition fades, I will have something to fall back on.”To the untrained eye, a sitar might seem like just another instrument, its shape familiar, its sound enchanting but distant.Yet, behind its curved frame lies a labour of profound patience.It begins with a kaddu (gourd) — immersed in water, softened, and then dried until the moisture evaporates, leaving behind a hard ened shell. This humble vegetable is carved and shaped into a hollow body, its curves sculpted with an understanding that is more instinct than technique.Craftsman Imran Salim described the process: “The polishing, the carving, the bridge, the turning pegs… everything has to be perfect. Each sitar takes about 20 to 25 days. You can’t rush it. It must be allowed to find its own voice.”But time, the very thing these artisans honour, is now their greatest adversary. The rise of mass-produced sitars — factory-made imitations that lack the warmth of handmade ones — has only added to their woes.Miarj’s fame was built upon its musical heritage, attracting luminaries like Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Pandit Venkatesh Kumar, Ustad Rashid Khan, and sitar virtuosos Shujaat Khan and Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan. Even Hridaynath Mangeshkar turned to Miraj for instruments that carried not just notes but soul.The city’s sitars still travel across borders, finding homes in concert halls, in the hands of maestros, in the quiet corners of music lovers who understand their worth. Yet, one cannot ignore the silence creeping in behind the melodies.","The artisans of Miraj have breathed life into the sitar for 300 years.

The popular Tibetan dish, thukpa, soon became a staple of the region, where Tibetans came as refugees. In no time, Trans Himalaya's produce was being exported to Sikkim and other parts of India as well as to adjoining Bhutan and other countries.While the thukpa produced by Trans Himalaya became a rage, most people in the region were not even aware the 14th Dalai Lama's elder brother lived in Kalimpong.""If we look at the history of noodles in Kalimpong... Gyalo Thondup started it in an authentic Tibetan style. By the 1970s, it had become extremely popular. His noodles were in demand until Covid,"" said trader Subash Pradhan who sells noodles in Kalimpong.Thukpa making involves rolling the dough, cutting it into thin strands with a techno blade, leaving it at room temperature for three days, and then sun-drying it for another day. Lhamo Thondup, an aide of the Dalai Lama's brother, had mastered the art and was the guiding force behind Trans Himalaya. His grandson Tenzing Rigzin now owns Eagle Noodles , another prominent Kalimpong brand.The Tibetan community remembers the leader differently. ""Thondup always had the well-being of his people in mind. He tried his best to negotiate with China for Tibet's freedom and has left behind a great legacy,"" said a businessman.","Dalai Lama's elder brother Gyalo Thondup set up a noodle-making factory in Kalimpong.

WHO: Use low sodium salt to reduce heart attack risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-use-low-sodium-salt-to-reduce-heart-attack-risk/articleshow/118130308.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a renewed effort to reduce sodium intake, WHO has recommended that people should consider replacing regular table salt with Lower-Sodium Salt Substitutes ( LSSS ).LSSS refers to the salt form in which a certain percentage of sodium chloride is replaced with another mineral, most commonly potassium chloride. Use of LSSS when compared to regular salt is linked with reduction in heart attack and stroke risk, WHO said.WHO, in 2012, had issued a guidance document that was later adopted by member states including India which set a global target to reduce mean population sodium intake by 30% by 2030. But current trends suggest slow progress which is why it has come up with this new strategy to promote LSSS, in addition to encouraging member states to reduce overall sodium intake.It is sold by different brands in India and has 15- to 30% less sodium. However, its uptake is very low due to higher cost and low awareness. Pink Himalayan salt, black salt and sea salt, that are growing in popularity, do not fall in this category.WHO recommendation is based on findings from 26 randomised controlled trials in adults in which assignment to LSSS compared to regular salt resulted in reductions in blood pressure over 56 days to five years of follow-up. LSSS is not only low in sodium, but also contains potassium which is associated with lower levels of blood pressure.However, WHO warns, high levels of potassium can be harmful to those with impaired kidney function because their kidneys may not be able to excrete mineral leading to hyperkalemia - a condition that affects heart function and can be life-threatening. WHO guideline on LSSS is, therefore, not applicable for individuals with kidney impairments or with other circumstances or conditions that might compromise potassium excretion. As there is insufficient evidence of the benefits of substituting regular table salt with LSSS in children & pregnant women, these two categories have also been kept out of the ambit of WHO recommendation.Dr Mohit Gupta, professor of cardiology at Delhi's G B Pant hospital said switching to low-sodium salt substitutes can be beneficial for most people in reducing sodium intake and lowering blood pressure, thereby decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases .Dr Kameshwar Prasad, head of neurology at Fortis Healthcare and Dr Kunal Gandhi, senior consultant, nephrology at Amrita Hospital Faridabad, on the other hand, suggested that it may be better to encourage cutting down salt intake instead of promoting LSSS.","LSSS refers to the salt form in which a certain percentage of sodium chloride is replaced with another mineral, most commonly potassium chloride.

NEW DELHI: Observing that a poem recited by Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi did not seem to be against any religion, Supreme Court on Monday asked the Gujarat govt ""to apply its mind"" to the poem and take a stand on the politician's plea to quash criminal proceedings initiated against him in the state for hurting religious sentiments.The court granted two weeks to the state govt to take a decision while highlighting that it was just a poem and creativity was also important for society. The bench said Gujarat high court did not appreciate the meaning of the poem while hearing a plea filed by Pratapgarhi.Appearing for the Congress MP, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, ""The judge (of Gujarat HC) has done violence to the law. That is my worry.""Reading English translation of the poem, which was attached by Pratapgarhi in his petition, the bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said, ""It is ultimately a poem. It is not against any religion. This poem indirectly says even if somebody indulges in violence, we will not indulge in violence. That's the message which this poem gives... that we will quietly suffer the violence but we will not do anything. So that somebody who indulges in violence will be dethroned. It is not against any particular community.""As the state govt sought time to file its reply and sought adjournment, the bench told its lawyer, ""Please apply your mind to the poem. After all, creativity is also important."" The court also extended its interim order by which the MP was protected in the case lodged against him for posting a video clip with the poem 'Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno'.On Jan 17, HC had refused to quash the FIR, saying there was a need for further probe. It had said the poem's tenor indicated something about the throne and that responses to the poem on social media pointed to a potential disturbance in social harmony. It had said all citizens, especially an MP, should behave in a manner that did not disrupt communal or social harmony.After Gujarat HC order, Pratapgarhi appealed in SC which on Jan 21 granted him protection. Noting that he had not been arrested in the case so far, SC had said ""no further steps shall be taken in any manner on the basis of the FIR"".",The court granted two weeks to the state govt to take a decision while highlighting that it was just a poem and creativity was also important for society.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction) became the latest in chorus of political parties slamming YouTuber and podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia for his ""inappropriate"" remark on the show India's Got Latent, calling it ""in poor taste"". However, the party also raised issue against the ""disproportionate outrage"" surrounding the controversy.Party spokesperson Anish Gawande warned that the backlash could be used to justify tighter government control over digital content creators under the proposed Broadcasting Bill.""Ranveer's comments on India’s Got Latent were in poor taste, but the disproportionate outrage risks setting a dangerous precedent,"" he said in a post on X.Gawande said that while Allahbadia’s comments were offensive, the response should not pave the way for increased censorship. “Many of us have spoken out against the proposed Broadcasting Bill, which threatens independent digital creators—we should not let this case become the pivot upon which the bill gains public support,” he said.The proposed legislation, designed to overhaul India's broadcasting regulatory framework, had sparked concerns about classifying independent news creators as broadcasters. Initially intended to focus on OTT platforms and digital news, the scope of the legislation was later broadened to include social media accounts, TOI had earlier reported. ""This law is not about accountability—it’s about control. The government has already scrutinised political YouTubers for their 2024 election coverage, and this bill would make it easier to regulate and silence them. We must be careful. Outrage against one creator should not justify a law that will curb free speech for all,"" Gawande added.Allahbadia, widely known as BeerBiceps, apologised after facing a wave of criticism for his controversial question to a contestant on the show. In a video statement, he admitted his comment was ""not just inappropriate, it wasn't even funny"" and distanced himself from comedy, saying, ""Comedy is not my forte. I am just here to say sorry.""A formal complaint was lodged against Allahbadia, comedian Samay Raina, and influencer Apoorva Makhija with the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra Women's Commission, accusing them of using obscene language to gain online popularity.The national human rights commission (NHRC) has also taken cognisance of the matter, writing to YouTube’s public policy head in India and calling for the episode’s removal. The NHRC’s letter alleged the show contained ""highly objectionable, inappropriate, and obscene remarks,"" which violated various laws, including the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Information Technology Act.Allahbadia, who has collaborated with the government in the past and received a National Creators Award from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has since requested the show’s producers to remove the controversial sections. “All I can say in the end is sorry. I hope you can forgive me as a human being,” he said in his apology video.","Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction) slams YouTuber and podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia for his ""inappropriate"" remark on India's Got Latent.

But when government raised the pay to Rs 524, his earnings quietly built up to nearly Rs 2.8 lakh in his account.When authorities discovered this, Kalaburagi jail chief superintendent R Anitha stepped in. She accompanied Durgappa to a bank, where he withdrew the required amount. He appeared in Raichur sessions court Thursday and paid the fine. The gavel struck again, this time in his favour.

He had been unwell for a few days, down with a bout of diarrhoea, but on January 12, seven-year-old Sai Chavan suddenly fell to the ground, and stopped moving. Mother Noor Jahan and father Suraj rushed him to hospital where doctors were flummoxed: Sai had symptoms they couldn't diagnose. Eventually, he was taken to a private hospital in Pune city and it was there that specialists had answers for the couple - their son had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).By early February, the Chavans' neighbourhood of Nanded Gaon had enough cases to be classified as the ""primary outbreak zone"" - nearly 90 cases would come from this area and nearby localities of Kirkatwadi, Sinhagad Road and Khadakwasla, all that were not long ago merged with Pune Municipal Corporation.On February 4, almost a month after the first cases emerged, health authorities released their findings.

So far, more than 180 people have been sickened; six have died.The Chavans found themselves at ground zero. ""We should never have trusted the corporation's water, it was our mistake,"" said Noor. Near her stood Suraj, trying to get his son to walk again. But Sai's knees buckled; he was still in pain.The family was given a municipal tap connection after Nanded Gaon merged with PMC in 2021, but with a catch: the water they got - for an hour every day - was sourced from a nearby well. The well's water was only chlorinated, unlike the rest of Pune's supply which goes through an elaborate purification process at a treatment plant. Incidentally, the well was also the source of water for households across Kirkatwadi, Nandoshi village, Dhayari, Sinhagad Road and DSK Vishwa township.Vikas Joshi, a resident of DSK Vishwa, whose brother is in hospital on oxygen support with GBS symptoms, says, ""There is no point in having a water filter here at home because the supply itself is so contaminated.

NEW DELHI: Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025 broke tradition with an open-air, informal conversation at Sunder Nursery, replacing the conventional auditorium setup, as students engaged with PM Narendra Modi in a free-wheeling discussion around diet, stress, technology and personal struggles related to examinations.Modi revealed, ""Had I not been PM, I would have liked to work in the skill development ministry."" He advised the young audience to ""break hierarchical barriers"" and emphasised, ""True leadership is about inspiring and guiding others, not just giving orders.""Focusing on skill development, Modi said, ""Degrees are valuable, but skills make you indispensable."" He shared examples of young entrepreneurs and innovators who turned their passions into careers, emphasising that adaptability and continuous learning define success today. ""You are lucky to be growing up in an era with so much technology... but you must decide whether you are using it wisely.""Are you spending hours watching reels, or are you learning something from technology? Technology is not a storm that will sweep you away-it is a tool. If you use it properly, it will empower you,"" PM Modi said addressing a common complaint parents have of their children.Students participated in a candid exchange with Modi, marked by warmth and spontaneity. ""Earlier, we met him on stage, but this time, it feels personal,"" one student shared. Another added, ""No scripts, no formality - just open discussion. It makes us feel heard.""The discussion covered a wide range of topics, from language and culture to health and mindfulness. Akanksha from Kerala praised Hindi, prompting the PM to recite a poem. ""Society wrongly associates success with exam scores. But real success comes from persistence. A good cricketer focuses on the ball, not the noise in the stadium. Similarly, students should focus on learning, not stress,"" Modi said.Traditional food customs were also highlighted as students enjoyed til-gud (sesame-jaggery) sweets. ""Just like we offer guests something at home, he shared with us,"" a student observed. PM Modi underscored mindful living, asking, ""Do you know how many teeth we have?"" to stress proper chewing habits.On exam stress, he reassured students, ""Marks don't define you."" Modi told students that knowledge and examinations are two different things. One should not view exams as be-all and end-all in life, he said.Stress, he said, is like a pressure cooker, and urged students to express their emotions openly. ""Depression often arises due to lack of communication,"" he noted, encouraging them to embrace challenges: ""Every difficulty brings an opportunity to grow.""Encouraging students to balance hobbies with studies, he used an analogy: ""If you have a pet dog at home, do you stop spending time with it just because exams are near? No, because it brings you joy. Similarly, hobbies refresh the mind and keep you balanced.""Urging parents to not use their children as models to ""show off"", he said they should not compare them with others and instead support them. When asked what advice he would give talented students who work hard but don't achieve success, Modi said ""rather than focusing on what someone is lacking, appreciate what they excel at. If you encourage them, they will feel valued. Instead of just studying for exams, students should also write-like poetry or essays-to express their thoughts.""He reinforced the importance of curiosity and lifelong learning, telling students, ""Be inquisitive. Never stop asking questions. Learning doesn't end with exams; it's a lifelong pursuit.""

NEW DELHI: If a convicted person is barred from government employment, what is the rationale behind provisions in the Representation of the People Act that allow a convicted criminal to contest elections and become a lawmaker six years after he has served the sentence, Supreme Court asked on Monday.After two landmark judgments on electoral reforms - mandatory disclosure of assets and criminal antecedents by candidates, and prescribing automatic disqualification on conviction and sentence beyond two years - a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan decided to foray into a possible third by agreeing to test the constitutional validity of parts of Sections 8 & 9 of RP Act - should there be a life ban on the convicted on contesting election?The SC asked government and EC to file replies to the plea by advocate-petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay in three weeks.Supreme Court said if Union government and EC did not file their responses within the stipulated period, it would still proceed with the matter and posted further hearing on March 4.Under the RP Act, a person is eligible to contest elections six years after he has served out the sentence awarded to him upon conviction in a criminal case or one concerning moral turpitude or corruption. Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Vikas Singh gave the example of a convicted criminal not being eligible for a peon's job in government but being eligible, six years after completion of prison term, to be a lawmaker. Drawing the court's attention to rising crimes by juveniles, Singh said even if held guilty for murder, a juvenile aged 17 would not get imprisonment of more than three years. This means, by the age of 26, he would be eligible to contest elections and if backed by a political party, he would stand a fair chance of becoming a lawmaker.Though this example caught the bench's imagination, Justice Manmohan appeared more aware of ground realities and machinations of convicted politicians in getting around even the six-year ban, making their wives either the CM or lawmaker. ""We must not do something that would provide another ruse for politicians to retain control through remote control,"" he said.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria supported the petition and told the court that the time had come to test the constitutional validity of certain parts of Sections 8 and 9 of RP Act that allowed a convicted criminal/politician to enter/re-enter the political arena.Tamil Nadu's additional advocate general Amit Anand Tiwari said the main stakeholders, national and state parties, should be given notice for their responses. The bench said these days SC proceedings were widely reported and it would hear arguments from all stakeholders, whosoever decided to address the court on this issue.In 2003, in People's Union for Civil Liberties case, SC had for the first time directed candidates contesting an election to declare their assets and criminal antecedents. This order was reinforced by another order in 2018, mandating candidates to file affidavits giving details of their criminal antecedents and details of their own and spouses' assets.",Supreme Court asks government and EC to file replies to the plea by advocate- petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay in three weeks.

India to cite recent duty cuts in bid to escape Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-cite-recent-duty-cuts-in-bid-to-escape-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118129430.cms,"25% steel tariff won't hit India's shipments to US

NEW DELHI: As President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US (on top of existing metal duties), India is getting ready to unbracket itself from countries he has called ""worst tariff manipulators"", citing its recent duty cuts to point to a reduction in average duties in recent years.On Monday, Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett said India has high tariffs that lock out imports, and added that Modi had a ""lot to discuss"" with Trump as they meet later this week.Following Budget announcements on tariff cuts for bikes, including the iconic Harley Davidson, and other products in the run-up to PM Modi's meeting with Trump, officials said they have prepared the ground for the PM to point to Trump that his govt is sensitive to White House's concerns and has undertaken a comprehensive look at tariffs to bring them down to Asean rates. They also pointed out that the reduction was a signal to the world that tariff rates were not high as perceived by some trading partners.The reduction in the Union Budget is estimated to have lowered the average duty by a percentage point to 10.6%. Average tariffs on imports from US have also come down over the years. In fact, for the top 30 imports from the US, including oil, gas, diamonds and airplanes, the levy is going up to 7.5% at the most, officials have said.Officials are also laying store by US' strategic requirement to have good strategic ties with India, that Trump may not breach New Delhi's pain barrier on threshold.Though Modi and Trump have enjoyed a good rapport since the latter's first term, the govt recognises that nothing can be taken for granted while dealing with a US president who sees himself as a transactionalist with an unrivalled capability to get the best deals for the US.While the proposed 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has rocked the world, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on India's shipments to the US. During the last fiscal year, India's export of iron and steel was estimated at $475 million, with iron and steel products adding up to another $2.8 billion. Export of aluminium and articles made of this metal were estimated at just under $950 million in 2023-24. The largest sources of US steel imports are Brazil, Canada and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to govt and American Iron and Steel Institute data.In 2018, the previous Trump administration had imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium, citing national security concerns. These tariffs covered most primary steel products, except stainless steel, and included steel pipes and tubes. The tariffs applied to most countries, triggering a wave of retaliatory measures and escalating tensions in global trade. This had also prompted American auto companies to slash production.Trump had clubbed India, along with China, Brazil and Mexico, as a high-tariff country and threatened action. So far, however, India has not faced any specific action and both sides have spoken about strengthening trade and economic relations. Modi's meeting with the US president is expected to only smoothen the process, given the close bond that the two leaders share.Trump's announcement pushed up gold prices, seen as a safe haven during turbulent times, while the dollar inched higher. While the sensex closed 550 points lower on Monday, global stocks seem to have shrugged off the threat. Global markets have been on the edge, wary of a possible trade war. The prospect of higher tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium in particular is, however, not good news for India as the domestic industry is already complaining of cheap imports flooding the markets. This could get worse if Trump goes ahead with his plan, likely Monday, as China would look at the vast Indian market to cover some of the probable losses in the US.The domestic steel industry has petitioned govt to impose 20-25% safeguard duty on steel to shield domestic players from predatory imports. Small businesses and exporters are, however, wary of these levies and have sought a ""balanced response"" so that Indian consumers do not end up paying more. An analysis by GTRI showed that India's iron and steel imports have grown from $10.4 billion in FY2018, when the US-China trade war began, to $18.6 billion in FY2024.","President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US.

The scheme, marketed as a CSR initiative by large companies, claimed to empower women and support low-income households. Women could own a brand-new scooter priced at Rs 1.2 lakh for just Rs 60,000. Laptops, water tanks, fertilisers, and sewing machines were also promised at massive discounts. This generous offer was allegedly devised and executed by Ananthu Krishnan , 28, of Kudayathoor in Idukki district, a self-styled social activist with an eye for deception.The scheme, police sources said, was nothing more than a sophisticated Ponzi operation, rechannelling funds from new investors to fulfil promises to earlier ones - until it all came crashing down.On Jan 30, Ananthu was arrested and police froze the bank accounts linked to the operation, cutting off the flow of funds. An SIT was formed to uncover the full extent of the fraud. By then, the scam had already ensnared between 30,000 and 40,000 people, many of whom had taken loans to invest. Over 3,000 people have filed complaints, with investigations estimating the total fraud amount at Rs 500 crore. In just 34 FIRs, Rs 37 crore was confirmed as swindled.As per investigators, Ananthu lived extravagantly on the bilked money. He rented luxury apartments in Kochi's Marine Drive, spent heavily on a posh lifestyle, and invested in properties in at least five locations across Idukki and Kottayam. Ananthu had carefully built an image of credibility. Fluent in English and active on social media, he posed for photos with celebrities, politicians, and govt officials, adding an air of legitimacy to his scheme.He said large corporations were funding the initiative under CSR obligations, and to make it appear authentic, he even approached companies & NGOs for real CSR contributions, though none materialised. A project named 'Women on Wheels' was the gateway to the scam's success. Initial investors received scooters, fuelling trust & encouraging more bargain-hunters to invest. Soon, the scheme expanded, offering household items at steep discounts.But as with any Ponzi scheme , the money eventually ran dry and left thousands in the lurch. A single complaint to Kerala's police chief triggered the first probe. ""We didn't know the magnitude of the scam when the first FIRs were registered,"" police said. Ananthu's scam was more than just a solo act. It involved a web of NGOs and influential figures. Many organisations unknowingly acted as intermediaries, collecting money from investors and forwarding it to the scam. The scam had also spilled into Kerala's political circles, with accusations surfacing against politicians from multiple parties.","Ananthu Krishnan, 28, of Kudayathoor in Idukki district, was arrested on Jan 30.

The move is aimed at disincentivising people to keep vehicles that were manufactured before the BS-II emission norms came into force. The ministry has proposed that renewal of registration of over 20-year-old motorcycles and cars would cost Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000 respectively.With focus on phasing out commercial medium and heavy vehicles that are over 15 years old, the draft rule has proposed renewal fees to Rs 12,000 and Rs 18,000 respectively. For renewing registration of such vehicles over 20 years would be doubled to Rs 24,000 and Rs 36,000 respectively.While the proposed changes would impact vehicle owners across the country, this will have no effect in Delhi-NCR where it's mandatory to scrap 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles because of the court's order.The road transport ministry in October 2021 had increased the registration and renewal fee of motorcycles, three-wheelers and cars, but had left out medium and heavy passenger and goods vehicles.

While we have proposed revised fees for 15-year-old commercial vehicles, we have sought to increase the renewal charge for the ones which were registered 20 years back,"" said a transport ministry official.Similarly, the ministry has proposed to double the fee for fitness tests of both private commercial vehicles that are over 20 years old.All India Motor Transport Congress said it has opposed ""sudden and excessive hike"" in the fitness test fees. It said the fee for fitness test ranged between Rs 500 and Rs 1,500 for most vehicles, with heavy transport vehicles paying a maximum of Rs 3,000. But in the draft notification, it has been more than doubled, with commercial motorcycles now requiring to pay Rs 1,000 for 8-15 year old and Rs 2,000 after 15 years. Similarly, fitness tests for three-wheelers and heavy vehicles have been proposed between Rs 7,000 and Rs 25,000. It has sought withdrawal of the draft notification.","The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification proposing a steep hike in renewal of their registration. The move is aimed at disincentivising people to keep vehicles that were manufactured before the BS-II emission norms came into force. While the proposed changes would impact vehicle owners across the country, this will have no effect in Delhi-NCR.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118128646,imgsize-1015803,width-400,resizemode-4/118128646.jpg"

To address these issues, the report recommends raising public investment in higher education to 6% of GDP, implementing performance-based funding, and granting greater autonomy to SPUs to improve governance and research capacity.SPUs, which serve as the backbone of India's higher education sector, are struggling with outdated infrastructure and insufficient research facilities, limiting their ability to produce impactful academic work. The report warns that access to digital resources remains a challenge, with only 32% of SPUs having fully functional digital libraries, making it difficult for students and faculty to access global research databases.The report highlights that over 40% of faculty positions remain vacant in SPUs, leading to an unfavourable student-teacher ratio of 30:1, compared to the recommended 15:1. As a result, students receive limited academic mentorship and research guidance, affecting both their learning outcomes and employability. ""SPUs must prioritise faculty recruitment and retention strategies. Without adequate teaching staff, the goal of improving academic standards cannot be achieved,"" states the report.The report notes that tuition fees in SPUs are, on average, 60% lower than those in private institutions, making higher education more accessible to students from socially and economically disadvantaged groups (SEDGs).To revitalise SPUs, the report proposes a multi-pronged reform strategy. It calls for public investment in higher education to be raised to at least 6% of GDP, in line with National Education Policy 2020 recommendations. It also suggests performance-based funding models to incentivise research, greater autonomy for SPUs in decision-making, and stronger academia-industry linkages to enhance graduate employability. Additionally, initiatives such as One Nation One Subscription (ONOS) scheme, which provides free access to over 13,000 global research journals, should be expanded to benefit all SPUs.The report underscores that govt colleges, particularly those affiliated with SPUs struggle with accreditation due to high NAAC costs, restricting their access to quality improvement funds. Additionally, bureaucratic inefficiencies delay curriculum updates & faculty recruitment, affecting academic quality.","State public universities (SPUs), which enrol 81% of India's higher education students, are grappling with severe faculty shortages and outdated infrastructure.

BENGALURU: Imagine taking a leisurely Sunday stroll, only to stumble upon your favourite artiste performing on the street, followed by the shock of him being put on pause. That's exactly what happened when Ed Sheeran treated Bengaluru to a surprise gig on Church Street during his India Tour - a true 'Peak Bengaluru' moment.Just as fans gathered in awe, police unplugged the mic mid-performance, citing lack of permission and footpath encroachment. As officers tried to escort him away, Sheeran told the crowd, ""We've permission to be here, but this policeman is shutting it down. See you later!""Ed Sheeran began singing at 11.51am but was shut down just a minute later. This reignited debates about whether authorities should be more flexible and welcoming to spontaneous artistic expressions. The local Cubbon Park police denied that permission was granted for the performance. When TOI tried to contact the management of Ed Sheeran, they were unresponsive. Ed Sheeran is in Bengaluru as part of his India tour.Sheeran, however, later posted on Instagram: “We had permission to busk, by the way. Hence, us playing in that exact spot was planned out beforehand. It wasn’t just us randomly turning up.”According to Cubbon Park police, no one approached them seeking permission to perform at the site. “No one can perform on the footpaths or roads as it causes inconvenience to others. Our team asked them to stop. When they didn’t heed, the cops at the spot unplugged the mic connection,” a police official said.Sanjay Kumar, president of Church Street and Rest House Association, defended the police action, asserting that rules must be followed. “Even abroad, performances require permission. Sheeran’s team could have approached us, and we would have arranged a private space in a restaurant or an open venue for Bengaluru to enjoy,” Kumar said.But fans and netizens voiced their frustration and disappointment, arguing that stopping a global pop icon from briefly performing was unnecessary and avoidable, especially in a city known for its vibrant music culture. While some called it an embarrassing moment for Bengaluru, others pointed to the lack of public spaces for cultural events.","Ed Sheeran performed on Bengaluru's Church Street during his India Tour.

ClutchPoints predicts the Los Angeles Lakers will target Bamba, who is currently a free agent.wrote ClutchPoints’ Matty Breisch.Mo Bamba, 26, last played for the Clippers this season, averaging 4.6 points and 4.3 rebounds on 46.6% shooting. While his numbers don’t jump off the page, his familiarity with the Los Angeles Lakers organization and the city of Los Angeles could make him a seamless fit. Bamba briefly donned the purple and gold in 2023 before being traded to the 76ers.Breisch added.Bamba’s skill set aligns with the Los Angeles Lakers’ needs. Standing at 7 feet tall, he brings rim protection, rebounding, and the ability to stretch the floor with his three-point shooting. While he may not match the potential of Mark Williams, Bamba offers a cost-effective and available option for a team in desperate need of frontcourt depth.The Lakers’ front office has limited choices as the postseason approaches.

"‘It won’t affect sharks’: Donald Trump pushes for plastic straws, calls paper ones ‘useless’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/it-wont-affect-sharks-donald-trump-pushes-for-plastic-straws-calls-paper-ones-useless/articleshow/118132800.cms,"US President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning the use of paper straws in federal agencies, declaring that they ""don’t work"" and calling for a return to plastic alternatives. The move reverses a Biden-era policy aimed at phasing out single-use plastics from federal operations.“It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said while signing the order, which instructs federal agencies to halt the purchase and distribution of paper straws in government buildings. The decision effectively scraps President Joe Biden’s initiative to eliminate single-use plastics, including straws, from federal food services by 2027 and from all operations by 2035.Trump, who has long criticised paper straws, reaffirmed his stance over the weekend, posting on social media that Biden’s policy was “DEAD!” His 2019 reelection campaign even sold Trump-branded plastic straws as a political statement against restrictions on single-use plastics.Environmental advocates argue that plastic straws contribute to pollution and threaten marine life, with experts warning that plastic waste, including straws, breaks down into harmful microplastics. Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director at Oceana, called Trump’s decision misguided. “The world is facing a plastic pollution crisis , and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today,” she said.Despite widespread bans on plastic straws in various US states and cities, Trump dismissed environmental concerns, stating, “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they’re eating, as they’re munching their way through the ocean.”The plastics industry has welcomed the decision. “Straws are just the beginning,” said Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association. “‘Back to Plastic’ is a movement we should all get behind.”According to the Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network, Americans use over 390 million plastic straws daily, with each straw taking around 200 years to decompose. Environmental groups have urged consumers to reduce plastic use to prevent further harm to wildlife.The global plastic pollution crisis has led to ongoing negotiations for an international treaty to limit plastic production and improve recycling efforts. Talks stalled last year in South Korea but are set to resume as more than 100 countries push for stricter regulations.Meanwhile, US manufacturers have called on Trump to stay engaged in the negotiations while reconsidering Biden’s approach, which emphasized redesigning plastics, increasing recycling, and promoting reusable materials.White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the order to Trump, claimed the push for paper straws had been costly and unpopular. “It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives,” he said.",US President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning the use of paper straws in federal agencies.

Mayo Clinic to provide strategic consultation to Adani hospitals

MUMBAI: Making its foray into the healthcare sector , the Adani Group will set up Mumbai's largest private hospital on a seven-acre plot in Kandivli, with 1,000 beds and a medical college.The group announced on Monday its plans to invest Rs 6,000 crore to construct two 1,000-bed multi-specialty hospitals and medical colleges in Mumbai and Ahmedabad, collaborating with Mayo Clinic , an American non-profit academic medical institution.The group also intends to develop another hospital near the forthcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport in Ulwe.Group chairman Gautam Adani said, ""Two years ago, as a gift to me on my 60th birthday, my family committed Rs 60,000 crore towards improving healthcare, education and skill development."" These facilities, designated as Adani Health Cities , aim to ""meet the cost of bringing affordable, world-class medical care and medical education to people from all strata of society pan India."" They will be managed by the group's not-for-profit healthcare arm, according to the statement.The initial Adani Health Cities in Mumbai and Ahmedabad will include medical colleges accommodating 150 undergraduate students annually, alongside more than 80 resident doctors and over 40 fellows.Adani Group chairman, Gautam Adani, took to social media to make the announcement.“Proud to launch Adani Health City in partnership with Mayo Clinic, pioneering world-class medical research, affordable healthcare & education. Starting with two 1000-bed hospitals and medical colleges in Ahmedabad & Mumbai, we are on a mission to bring cutting-edge medical innovation across India. This is just the beginning for a healthier, stronger India – one campus at a time,” he said.Mumbai’s western suburbs, where the Adani hospi tal is going to come out, have always had a poor bed-to-population ratio. Experts have blamed rising real estate costs and congestion for this.According to recent BMC figures, Mumbai has 15,302 govt hospital beds and 31,076 private hospital beds. Public institutions such as KEM Hospital in Parel and JJ Hospital in Byculla have between 1,500 and 2,000 beds each. Only Bombay Hospital near New Marine Lines and Kokilaben Hospital in Andheri, amongst private facilities, have 800-plus and 750 beds respectively.Central Mumbai, particularly Parel, has the highest concentration of beds due to the presence of public facilities such as Tata Memorial, KEM and Wadia Hospital. But there are very few public or private facilities beyond Andheri.While the Adani Hospital would address this shortage, health activists said that cost considerations remain important.Meanwhile, the Adani statement said that Mayo Clinic would provide strategic consultation regarding organisational objectives and clinical practices.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
