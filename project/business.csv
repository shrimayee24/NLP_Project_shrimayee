In response to an RTI query, National Medical Commission (NMC) stated that of the 11,200 applications for registration received, 91% have not been approved as of Aug 8.Launched with much fanfare by Union health minister on Aug 23, 2024, the NMR portal of NMC for registration of all MBBS doctors eligible to practise in India has failed to take off. NMR was hailed as a move to ""strengthen the digital healthcare ecosystem"", after which similar registers were to be launched for paramedics and other healthcare professionals. Yet, with the register for doctors - who constitute the smallest professional group in the health system - not materialising, it remains to be seen whether the registers for an estimated 35 lakh nurses and for paramedics, who would be more than double the number of nurses, will happen any time soon.In response to a question in Parliament, the health ministry said that 13.9 lakh MBBS doctors are registered with state councils, of which it is assumed that about 80% (over 11 lakh) are available.NMC had issued the Registration of Medical Practitioners and Licence to Practice Medicine Regulations, 2023, on June 8, 2023. According to the regulation, NMC's Ethics & Medical Registration Board shall maintain the NMR, which shall contain entries of all doctors in all state registers maintained by state medical councils. The regulations envisage a unique identification number for every doctor, centrally generated by EMRB, which will ""grant registration in NMR and eligibility to practice medicine in India"".All existing medical practitioners enrolled in the Indian Medical Register or the State Medical Register not having registration number as per the regulation were mandated to update their registration in the web portal of EMRB within three months of publication of the regulation.However, applications have petered out as approvals for 90% of those who applied are still pending. From 6,000 applications in the first three months after launch, applications have dwindled to less than 800 in past four months.The renewal of registration every five years is supposed to happen through state councils and the status of registration in the state registry ""shall automatically reflected (sic) in the National Register"". However, state registries are yet to be linked to NMR.""Even when state councils confirm the membership of a doctor, NMC is rejecting it, as in my case,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist.

NEW DELHI: Air India on Saturday said that a data network outage at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport would cause delays in flight operations, including its own services, from the country's second-busiest airport.The airline noted that the outage, which had disrupted check-in systems at the airport and delayed departures, has since been resolved. However, some flights may continue to be affected for a while as operations return to normal.""A third-party data network outage had impacted check-in systems at Mumbai airport, thereby delaying flight departures of airlines, including Air India.

The IGIA, the country’s busiest airport, handles around 1,300 flight movements daily.The India Meteorological Department had issued a red alert early in the morning for heavy rain accompanied by lightning and thunderstorms across parts of north, west, south, southeast, and central Delhi, but later downgraded it to a yellow alert, advising residents to remain cautious.In the 24 hours ending 8:30 am, Safdarjung, the city’s main weather station, recorded 78.7 mm of rain.

""US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India's biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,"" said the authors - Raka Saxena and Ramesh Chand - of the working paper. Chand is member, Niti Aayog, while Saxena is senior adviser at the think tank.Although the paper used a disclaimer terming the content as personal views of authors, its recent withdrawal from the think tank's website reflects govt's thinking on the issue of GM products.India currently allows commercial cultivation of only transgenic cotton, a non-food farm item.Govt's stand is in sync with RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch's opposition to the cultivation and import of GM farm products. In its opposition to transgenic food items, the SJM has even joined hands with several left-leaning farm groups in the past.The working paper had pitched for a ""dual-track"" approach while negotiating the trade deal on agricultural items with the US and appeared keen on opening the country's market to specific non-sensitive imports of farm products that do not face direct competition from local producers, such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.India has maintained a surplus in agriculture trade with the US and it has increased over time. India's agricultural exports to the US grew nearly fivefold between 2004 and 2024, from $1.18 billion to $5.75 billion, while imports however, grew faster - from $291 million in 2004 to $2,218 million in 2024.","The Niti Aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper, which had suggested opening up import of genetically modified (GM) soybean and corn from the US, has given a peek into India's red-line on transgenic food items.

It is very shameful for any citizen of this country to ask for reservation after 65 years of independence. When our Constitution was framed, it was understood that reservation would remain for a period of 10 years but unfortunately it has continued even after 65 years of independence. The biggest threat, today, for the country is corruption.""Saying that reservations have caused social divisiveness, Justice Pardiwala had observed, ""The parody of the situation is that India must be the only country wherein some of the citizens crave to be called backward.""This anti-quota remark in a judgment incensed many political leaders and 58 Rajya Sabha MPs moved a notice for initiation of his removal from judgeship. Within a few hours of the motion being filed by the MPs, the Gujarat govt came to Justice Pardiwala's rescue by moving an application requesting the judge to expunge the 'offensive' remarks.Justice Pardiwala acted swiftly and expunged the entire paragraph 62 from his judgment. He directed the HC registry to issue a fresh certified copy of the judgment sans Paragraph 62 which had contained the controversial anti-quota observation.","Justice J B Pardiwala was fast-tracked to Supreme Court in May 2022.

ISLAMABAD: Stung by the IAF chief’s assertion, backed with photographs and video images, Pakistan swung into damage control, with its defence minister Khwaja Asif rejecting the statement that India had downed multiple Pakistani fighter jets and one large aircraft in Operation Sindoor. Asif called the statement “implausible, ill-timed and a dangerous distortion of the May clashes”. He also claimed the IAF chief’s statement was made “to serve domestic politics”.In a statement on X, Asif claimed New Delhi was attempting to rewrite the narrative months after the fighting ended. “It is ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by the strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians,” he said.Asif said no such statement on Pakistani losses had surfaced for three months, while Pakistan had immediately shared “detailed technical briefings” with the international media.The minister insisted not a single Pakistani aircraft was destroyed. Instead, he claimed Pakistan’s forces had shot down six Indian jets, including advanced fighters, destroyed S-400 air defence systems, downed unmanned aircraft, and disabled “several Indian airbases”.“If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification — though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure,” Asif said.","IAF chief claimed India had downed multiple Pakistani fighter jets and one large aircraft in Operation Sindoor.

Punjab launches anti-drone systems to tackle cross-border smuggling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-launches-anti-drone-systems-to-tackle-cross-border-smuggling/articleshow/123207440.cms,"AAP National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal with Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann (ANI image)

CHANDIGARH: Chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Saturday announced the launch of anti-drone systems, aimed at curbing the smuggling of drugs and weapons through drones from Pakistan. He declared that Punjab is the first state in India to deploy such a system in its border areas.Mann, along with AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal , unveiled three anti-drone systems during an event in the border district of Tarn Taran.The anti-drone system will be called 'Baaz Akh' (Hawk Eye), the chief minister said, adding that it will be deployed from Pathankot to Fazilka as the second line of defence in the border districts in coordination with the Border Security Force.Mann explained that the second line of defence refers to the deployment of the Punjab Police in border districts, working alongside the BSF stationed at the international border.He emphasised that this initiative marks a significant step for the Punjab government in the fight against the smuggling of drugs and arms across the border. ""In the coming days, we will expand the anti-drone system throughout the state,"" he added.Reaffirming his government's commitment to maintaining peace and harmony in the state, Mann said this initiative will play a crucial role in the government's anti-drug drive, Yudh Nasheyan Virudh (war against drugs).To enhance border security and address challenges posed by drone activities from Pakistan, nine anti-drone units are being established along the international border for Rs 51.4 crore, Mann informed, asserting that the anti-drone system will significantly counter the activities of drug smugglers.""The enemies of the country have turned drones into weapons to harm Punjab's youth, using them to smuggle drugs across the border,"" Mann said, praising the security forces for their relentless efforts to combat cross-border drug trafficking.He said that in 2024, a total of 283 drones loaded with heroin , weapons, and ammunition were seized, and as of 2025, 137 drones have already been recovered.Expressing confidence that the anti-drone system will assist the security forces in combating the smuggling of drugs and weapons, Mann said it will be deployed at specific border points where high drone activity has been observed.Mann claimed that the Punjab Police did not have any such system to neutralise drones previously.Further informing that the anti-drone system is equipped to accurately detect the drone's position and its ground control stations, the chief minister stated that this system comes with an automated alert technology, which immediately notifies authorities upon detecting drone movement, thus eliminating the need for manual monitoring.To ensure effective implementation, coordination will be maintained with the BSF, the Air Force, the Army, and other relevant agencies, Mann stated.During the launch, Kejriwal stated that another chapter has been added to their fight against drugs. He highlighted the AAP government's efforts to tackle the drug menace while criticising previous governments for their alleged collusion with drug smugglers, which he claimed contributed to the state's drug problems.Announcing that a crackdown against drug trafficking has begun, and the 'big fish' involved in this trade have been rounded up, Kejriwal further claimed that a notorious and feared drug lord has been put behind bars by the Bhagwant Mann government.He mentioned that the Punjab Police is actively taking action against drug smugglers, including demolishing properties acquired through drug trafficking as part of their anti-drug campaign.""We know that most drugs enter from Pakistan through drones. Today, the Punjab government is implementing the anti-drone system, which will neutralise any drone that crosses into Punjab from Pakistan,"" the former Delhi chief minister said.Three anti-drone systems were launched on Saturday, with plans to deploy six more. If necessary, additional systems will be purchased, Kejriwal stated, emphasising the government's commitment to eradicating the drug menace in Punjab.",Punjab is the first state in India to deploy such a system in its border areas.

A 26-year-old Indian man is facing deportation from the UK after repeatedly stalking a female colleague at London Zoo.Asish Jose Paul, originally from Kerala, ignored multiple police warnings, court bail conditions, and even a restraining order before being sent back, the Daily Mail reported.Paul bombarded former co-worker Lutaruta Masiulonyte with text messages, flowers and chocolates over six months between July and December last year, despite her making it clear she was uncomfortable.Paul was first arrested and released on bail with instructions to stay away from the zoo. He even proposed to Lutaruta, Southwark Crown Court heard. The very next day, he returned to speak to Masiulonyte.After more arrests, Paul was given new bail conditions banning him from Westminster and from going within 50 metres of London Zoo. Still, he kept showing up, telling Royal Park staff he was ""in love"" with her.Paul had used three SIM cards and a friend’s phone to keep contacting the victim, and that his mother had also tried to reach her.Judge Jas Jandu imposed a six-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months, 20 days of rehabilitation activity, and a ten-year restraining order. He also warned Paul that he met the criteria for deportation once his visa expires in September 2025.“You have to leave her alone, Mr Paul, do you understand? Or it could be up to five years in prison,” the judge told him.In a victim impact statement, Masiulonyte said the ordeal had left her emotionally drained and constantly anxious. “The harassment was going on for so long it drained me. I feel scared and anxious being in London. My friends and family are worried for me and for my safety. I lost my independence through the harassment. I have to rely on someone to be with me to feel safe,” she said.Judge Jandu said Paul obtained Masiulonyte’s number “by means unknown to her” and approached her at work to ask why she was not replying to his messages. “She made it clear that she was uncomfortable and blocked your number,” he said. “A polite smile is not an invitation to anything further. It went from small talk to a declaration of love to a proposal.”The court heard Paul had studied business administration in India before completing a master’s in accounting and finance at Anglia Ruskin University in 2023. His defence barrister, Georgina Lane, said he had reduced responsibility due to a mental disorder and learning disabilities, and that he had “learned his lesson” after time spent in custody.Paul had met the victim while working at the zoo café. Even after being dismissed from his job, he continued trying to contact her, including approaching her colleagues for information. Masiulonyte eventually had to change her work location.The judge concluded that unless Paul is granted a new visa, he is liable to be deported to India.Last month, Jaydeep Patel, another Indian-origin man living in Phoenix, US, was arrested on suspicion of child sexual abuse and was charged with nine counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, according to court documents.Patel used to work at Phoenix Children's Hospital as a behavioral health technician but at the time of his arrest, he was no longer employed by the hospital.","Asish Jose Paul, originally from Kerala, ignored multiple police warnings, court bail conditions, and even a restraining order before being sent back.

Navarro gave an answer and then said he gave a ""really good answer"", but back in the studio, Collins asked former ambassador John Bolton, Trump's NSA between 2018-2019, whether Navarro actually gave a good answer.""China buys more Russian oil than India does, and they have not been targeted for that.

Keep in mind that we have over 50 percent tariffs on China already,"" Navarro said.Collins then countered Navarro and said China's tariff could go up higher as a punishment for buying Russian oil going beyond the existing 50 per cent tariff.""So we don’t want to get to the point where we actually hurt ourselves,"" Navarro said, patting himself on his back for giving a good question.""And I think I’ve given a really good answer to that.

Loudspeakers removed, apps, home speakers replace azan; community debates change",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/why-mumbai-mosques-are-falling-silent-loudspeakers-removed-apps-home-speakers-replace-azan-community-debates-change/articleshow/123178880.cms,"Living Without The Call

Rise Of The Azan App

The Noise Pollution Angle

Enforcing Noise Guidelines

MUMBAI: Right opposite Sunni Badi Masjid in central Mumbai’s Madanpura lives Ayaz Mohammed Hussain’s family — in a two-room house in an old building named Chhota Isa. Hussain, 65, a retired railway guard, and wife Shama never had to check namaz time on their wall clock or mobile.The 127-year-old mosque’s loudspeakers amplified the azan five times a day. Until the night of June 24, when police took them down.Residents of Madanpura and many other parts of the city are now experiencing an unexpected stillness in their immediate environment since police in Mumbai began enforcing noise guidelines two months ago.“We are coming to terms with the new norm. For years, we were used to listening to azan on loudspeakers,” says Hussain, standing in the gallery, gazing at the mosque’s green minarets, no longer mounted with amplifiers. “Even the announcement of maiyyat (deaths) in the mohalla was made on the loudspeakers. This morning, we learnt of a death in the locality only after the janaaza (funeral procession) passed through my lane. ”The city, especially its Muslim pockets, is gradually learning to live without the call for prayer on loudspeakers ever since the Devendra Fadnavis govt, acting on a court order, began to crack down. It’s an initiative that has political overtones, given the sporadic protests organised in the past by right-wing outfits against mosques.This time the tipping point has been a lack of resistance from minority religious groups, who would rather take recourse to law to settle the issue.Bombay high court, through its Jan 2025 verdict, graded the punishment for violation of noise control in three stages — warning, penalty (Rs 5,000 per day) and seizure of loudspeakers. But the cops began enforcing the noise guidelines (55 decibels in daytime and 45 decibels at night) strictly only after BJP leader Kirit Somaiya turned it into a personal crusade.When police teams stopped him from holding protests in the mosques’ vicinity, he would visit police stations to remind them about the court order.For the observant, OnlineAzan, an app, has since become the go-to tool for real-time updates from their neighbourhood place of worship. “We began broadcasting the azan on this app soon after police removed loudspeakers. Initially, many opposed it, as they said it might affect the legal challenge to police action against loudspeakers in Bombay high court,” says Raees Ansari, a member of the Sunni Badi Masjid’s management committee. Nearly 5,000 people in his locality have downloaded the app, and the number is increasing as word spreads, he adds.The increasing use of the free app indicates a significant change sweeping through Muslim neighbourhoods, where the call to the devout, simultaneously from multiple mosques, would often draw complaints, especially from other communities. “Azan on loudspeakers is not mandated by Islam. Muslims here should have voluntarily removed loudspeakers. Globally, many mosques broadcast azan through apps,” says Bandra resident and city Congress general secretary Asif Farooqui.Anti-noise pollution activist Sumaira Abdulali, who had filed a petition in 2004 demanding enforcement against use of loudspeakers by all faiths, said it was in 2016 that the court said, “Religion is not a reason to break noise rules.”Managing trustee of Mahim Juma Masjid, Fahad Khalil Pathan, informs that 72 mosques in the city have switched to the app, partly indicating the community’s willingness to embrace technology for reforms. It also reflects inability of mosque managements to stonewall police action.Pathan says he was the first in the city to download and introduce it at his mosque. “A group in Chennai created this app a couple of years ago. This has been a big source of relief, since we introduced it after many complained that they didn’t have a way of knowing azan time,” he says.What forced many mosques to voluntarily bring decibel levels down to permissible limits or remove loudspeakers was the state additional director general of police (ADGP)’s circular of May 11, 2025. It said all religious places seeking permission for use of loudspeakers needed to submit property cards and registration certificates from the Waqf Board or charity commissioner.“This was deliberately done to discourage mosques from applying for permission to use loudspeakers. The police have no business to ask for property cards or registration certificates because neither high courts in any state nor the Supreme Court mandated it while giving guidelines on use of loudspeakers,” argues former minister Arif Naseem Khan.Khan led a meeting of senior clerics and imams, where it was decided that a legal panel, led by advocate Yusuf Muchchala, would challenge the police action. The matter is sub judice.Some mosques, including Rahe Medina Masjid in Maharashtra Nagar, within the sprawling slum of Mankhurd, have even installed small sound boxes on request in nearby homes to relay the azan and skirt the ban. “We did it soon after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Raj Thackeray began protesting against azan on loudspeakers in 2022.Small speakers linked to the machine inside the mosque broadcast the azan to around 50 homes in the locality. It does not disturb anyone,” says mosque committee member Razzak Shaikh.Non-Muslims have largely cheered the silencing of the loudspeakers. Abraham Mathai, the former vicechairman of state minorities commission and a longtime resident of Kalina, which has a sizable Muslim population, says he used to be quite annoyed by the sound through the day. “I welcome this move by many mosques and request people of all religions to take steps to reduce loudspeaker decibels while they celebrate festivals,” Mathai says.Now, as Ganesh Chaturthi, Maharashtra’s most popular Hindu festival, nears, many feel Mumbai Police will be on test to ensure they are as proactive in enforcing the noise guidelines at pandals as they were at mosques.“The police removed loudspeakers from our mosque at night, refusing to wait for the next morning, when a Muslim delegation was scheduled to meet deputy CM Ajit Pawar. Will the cops show such urgency while they deal with complaints of noise-rule violations by people of other faiths?” wonders Ansari, standing at the Madanpura mosque’s gate.","Mumbai's Muslim pockets are gradually learning to live without the call for prayer on loudspeakers.

"Anand Mahindra reacts to Trump’s tariffs: ""India should seize this moment like 'Amrit' from a global Manthan""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/anand-mahindra-reacts-to-trumps-tariffs-india-should-seize-this-moment-like-amrit-from-a-global-manthan/articleshow/123166411.cms,"Reforms, not reactions: What Anand Mahindra suggests India must do

Unleashing the power of tourism as a forex engine

A broader economic agenda for resilience and growth

Learning from unintended global consequences

Turning adversity into advantage

In the wake of US President Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on Indian imports, industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India. Drawing a powerful analogy from Indian mythology, Mahindra urged the nation to extract 'Amrit', opportunity and growth, from the 'Manthan' or global churn caused by escalating trade wars. He emphasized that instead of viewing the tariffs as a setback, India should treat them as a catalyst for internal reforms, economic acceleration, and a repositioning of its global image as a trusted investment destination.According to Mahindra, incremental reforms are no longer sufficient. He emphasized the need for India to radically improve its ease of doing business, beginning with a truly functional single-window clearance system for all investment proposals. While acknowledging that states control many investment-related regulations, he proposed forming a coalition of willing states that align with a central national platform to demonstrate India’s ability to move with speed, simplicity, and predictability.Such measures, Mahindra believes, will not only help neutralize the impact of tariffs but also transform India into a magnet for global capital. In a world where trusted partnerships are in high demand, India has a unique opportunity to present itself as a dependable, long-term destination for investors.Mahindra also flagged tourism as a massively underutilized asset in India’s economic strategy. He called for the urgent need to accelerate visa processing, improve infrastructure for foreign visitors, and create dedicated tourism corridors around existing hotspots. These corridors, he said, must prioritize security, sanitation, and hygiene to attract international travelers and serve as templates for other regions.Tourism, Mahindra argued, has the potential to generate enormous foreign exchange, boost local employment, and revitalize India’s image on the world stage if treated as a strategic sector.Mahindra did not stop at investment and tourism. He laid out a broader framework aimed at ensuring long-term economic resilience. Key priorities include liquidity support for MSMEs, acceleration of infrastructure investment, and a manufacturing push through the enhancement and expansion of the PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) schemes.He also urged policymakers to rationalize import duties, especially those on raw materials and components critical to manufacturing, to help make Indian products globally competitive.In his remarks, Mahindra highlighted how other countries are using the global tariff war to address long-standing economic inefficiencies. Germany, for example, is rethinking its fiscal orthodoxy, opening doors to greater defense and infrastructure spending, while Canada is making efforts to break down long-standing internal trade barriers.These examples, he suggested, show how external pressure can trigger internal transformation. For India, the question is whether it can also use this moment of global churn to create positive, long-term consequences for its own economy.Mahindra concluded his remarks with a message that balanced realism with optimism. Acknowledging that nations like the US will always prioritize their own interests, he stressed that India should be no different. The goal, he said, should not be to complain but to adapt, reform, and rise. After all, every challenge is just an opportunity in disguise—sometimes wearing a slightly grumpy face. If the world throws tariffs, maybe it's time we throw back innovation.“Just as the 1991 forex reserves crisis triggered liberalization,” Mahindra wrote, “can today’s global manthan over tariffs yield some ‘amrit’ for us?” His call to action was clear: let India use this moment to shape its own destiny intentionally, ambitiously, and decisively.","Industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

New green card rules for non-citizen children in US: How will it affect Indians?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-green-card-rules-for-non-citizen-children-in-us-how-will-it-affect-indians/articleshow/123196395.cms,"USCIS issues new rule for age calculation of a child seeking green card along with parents.

How will it affect Indian families?







The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a new rule for age calculation of non-citizen children applying for a green card on their parents' petitions. It stated that, starting from August 15, the Final Action Date will be used for calculating the child's age instead of the current rule of considering the Dates for Filing. This means more children will age out soon.An unmarried alien child must be under age 21 to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States based on their parent’s approved petition for a family-sponsored, employment-based, or diversity visa. If they turn 21 and age out during the immigration process, they generally are no longer eligible to immigrate based on their parents’ petition.The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) helps certain children remain eligible for a Green Card past their 21st birthday, protecting them from “ageing out” due to long processing delays.In February 2023, USCIS expanded this protection by allowing the Dates for Filing chart, often years ahead of the Final Action Dates chart, to determine when a visa is “available” for CSPA purposes. This let many families file sooner and lock in a child’s age under 21.""If an alien is applying for adjustment of status under a family-sponsored, employment-based preference, or diversity visa, they must seek to acquire lawful permanent residence within one year of when a visa becomes available to benefit from the CSPA age calculation.This update also clarifies that we consider an alien to have satisfied the “sought to acquire” requirement if they demonstrate extraordinary circumstances for failing to seek lawful permanent resident status within one year of when a visa becomes available. If an alien demonstrates extraordinary circumstances for not applying for adjustment of status during the period of the Feb. 14, 2023, policy before August 15, 2025, we will calculate CSPA age under the Feb. 14, 2023, policy,"" the USCIS said.Children could now turn 21 before the Final Action Date is reached, and thereby they have to switch to a separate petition. Since the rule is to be implemented from August 15, Indian families can file adjustment of status applications as soon as the Dates for Filing chart allows, especially before August 15, 2025, to lock in the more favorable CSPA age calculation.","U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a new rule for age calculation of non-citizen children applying for a green card on their parents' petitions.

TCS Salary Hike: Top Points



TCS Layoffs

TCS salary hike: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services firm, has announced salary hikes for approximately 80% of its employees. The salary hikes will mainly cover the IT giant’s junior and mid-level staff. The salary hike announcement comes at a time when TCS has announced that it will lay off around 12,000 employees in the course of this year.The staff reductions at TCS have sparked broader discussions about potential fundamental changes in the IT sector, considering global economic uncertainties, the effects of US tariff policies on outsourcing attitudes, and disruptions caused by artificial intelligence.Currently, leading Indian IT service providers have reported modest revenue increases in Q1 FY26, concluding a challenging June quarter. This performance reflects the impact of unstable economic conditions and political tensions globally, which have affected technology spending and caused delays in client decisions.In an email communication to staff on Wednesday, TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad and CHRO Designate K Sudeep confirmed that the salary adjustments would take effect from September 1.Also Read | TCS layoffs: What will Tata Consultancy Services do for 12,000 employees it will let go this year?
