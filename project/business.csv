"Thirty-nine untapped drains a big challenge ahead of 2025 Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, NMCG steps in to fix the gap",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thirty-nine-untapped-drains-a-big-challenge-ahead-of-2025-maha-kumbh-in-prayagraj-nmcg-steps-in-to-fix-the-gap/articleshow/112792825.cms,"NEW DELHI: As Prayagraj gears up for Maha Kumbh next year, 39 untapped drains out of a total 81 that flow into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in the city have remained a big challenge to maintain cleanliness during the mega event scheduled for January 14 to February 26.Sensing the urgency, the National Mission for Clean Ganga ( NMCG ) — a central agency that implements the Ganga rejuvenation plan - has sanctioned three new sewage treatment plant (STP) projects at an estimated cost of Rs 987 crore to significantly increase the sewage treatment capacity of the city and been working with local authorities to intercept and divert the untapped drains.Multiple other activities, including a detailed sanitation plan and use remote sensing and GIS technologies to map the impact of the temporary population on sewerage infrastructure and river water quality during Maha Kumbh, have also been taken up to make it a memorable event for crores of visitors at Sangam during Jan-Feb 2025.Currently, the city has a combined sewage treatment capacity of 340 million litres per day (MLD) against generation of around 500 MLD. This means 160 MLD of untreated sewage is being discharged into the rivers Ganga and Yamuna. ""This is exactly why the three new STPs have been sanctioned as these projects will increase the city's total sewage treatment capacity to 523 MLD,"" said an NMCG official.The new STPs will come up at Salori (capacity of 43 MLD with a of Rs 325 crore), at Rasoolabad (capacity of 90 MLD with a cost of Rs 476 crore) and at Naini (capacity of 50 MLD with a cost of Rs 186 crore).Since tapping the drains would be important to keep the rivers clean for the holy dip, the executive committee of the NMCG, headed by its director general Rajeev Kumar Mital, had last month sanctioned remediation of 22 untapped drains during the Maha Kumbh period at an estimated cost of over Rs 55 crore. Remaining 17 untapped drains will be managed by the local authorities, using the Maha Kumbh 2025 budget.Under the detailed sanitation plan, the NMCG through its 'Namami Gange' programme has decided deployment of 1.45 lakh community toilets, 20,000 urinals and a number of prefabricated steel toilets and solid waste bins across the city. In addition, five ghats and two crematoria have been constructed to ensure cleanliness and sanitation during the mega event.",39 untapped drains out of a total 81 that flow into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in the city have remained a big challenge to maintain cleanliness.

GenAI will ensure strong hiring growth: Infosys CEO Parekh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/genai-will-ensure-strong-hiring-growth-infosys-ceo-parekh/articleshow/112787130.cms,"When do you see this low single-digit growth environment changing? Hiring too has been very weak. Is it primarily because of global macro conditions?

The American economy is seen to have been relatively strong for some time. Yet, there is this demand slowdown for IT…

In 2015, Infosys had funded OpenAI and ANSR (GCC consultancy and solutions company). But it subsequently did not take that forward or divested. Today, the two words everyone in the Indian tech industry are talking about are AI and GCC. Very recently, Accenture invested a big amount in ANSR. Did you miss the bus on those two opportunities?

There are GCCs that say it’s more efficient to do tech in a GCC, than with an IT services partner. Several seem to be bringing more and more work in-house. They also seem to want to do cutting-edge tech like GenAI themselves, instead of giving it to IT services players. They seem to be taking over the higher value work.

How do you see your progress with GenAI? Where is it having the biggest impact?

Can you provide metrics of improvements in areas where GenAI is being applied?

Nilekani spoke about how AI doomerism has quietened down. With his tech evangelism and boardroom connections and your soft power leadership, how are you rallying forces, especially on the sales and delivery side, to become an AI-first enterprise?

Infosys is in the leaderboard quadrant in terms of use cases for GenAI. Some of your peers have called out the pipeline for GenAI, even though it’s not converted into revenue yet. When do you think you'll move away from POCs to seeing revenues trickle into the books?

But the split between traditional AI and Gen AI, do you think there's value in calling them out separately?

How comfortable are enterprises with chatbots? There are hallucination issues.

How do you position yourself against the big four? They straddle the entire spectrum, while companies like yours predominantly do technology work.

Cybersecurity is a boardroom agenda. In your annual report, you've disclosed how Infosys is under-covered for cybersecurity insurance. Do you want to increase that coverage?

Is there a truce after the GST pre-showcause GST tax notice?

BENGALURU: Salil Parekh looks trim and fit. When we ask him about it, the Infosys CEO & MD says he isn’t getting as much time for fitness as he would like. Infosys probably requires more of his time now. The company, and its peers, are going through a lean phase. Revenue growth is in low single digits for the biggest companies, though the last quarter showed signs of incipient recovery.Global capability centres (tech & operations arms of MNCs) in India look to be taking away business that previously went to IT services partners. AI is disrupting all businesses. Nine years ago, Infosys was the company that invested in GenAI pioneer OpenAI and a GCC consulting company, only to abandon those initiatives two years later. Big miss? In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Parekh answers this and more.I think employee growth is going to be very strong. GenAI is giving us new areas where we can do projects. So, while there are some areas for improvements, overall, we see a positive revenue impact on growth. We’ve called out a guidance of 3% to 4% for the full financial year. We don't have a view at least of what the next financial year will look like in terms of growth. Broadly, we have extremely talented people in India, so I don't see how anyone can really compete with that.Large tech projects need big commitments of capital as you start those programmes, and given the interest rate increases in the last two or three years in Europe and the US, we've not seen such large programmes starting. My sense is companies are being careful. Right now, a lot of the work we see is around cost takeout or efficiency.Those, as you know, happened a while ago. If you look at generative AI, what we are doing today is market leading, and we are quite happy with the outcome there. Regarding GCCs, there are multiple themes. First, we are partners with them as they are growing in India, because many of their parent organisations have been clients of ours for years. Second, we've seen that these GCC investments have a lifecycle. Things that were created 10-15 years ago, with changes within the companies, they want to move to some different areas, and then they move away from it. So, in the last 2-3 years, we have taken over some GCCs which are older. At the start, we help and support, and as they mature, because of our scale, we are much more able to bring efficiency to those programmes. The automation we build is very different from what some of the GCCs employ. So, as they grow in the maturity lifecycle, we see clients saying, can you take that over and make it more efficient, or become partners with us.When a new technology comes, there's a lot of interest with the client to build something which is more within their own organisation. What is the benefit with us? We are doing hundreds of projects in GenAI, across every industry. Our experience, the people that we work with, the knowledge that we build will be much broader based. So, it's very difficult for someone else to have that level of expertise and depth. Because it's new, it's something that many large companies want to make sure that they have some ability to drive themselves. But as you build scale, that knowledge and depth is where we are very good. And we've seen over time that this plays out. As for efficiency, newer GCCs are probably one hundredth, if not one-thousandth of our size. It is difficult with that scale to make the sort of efficiency play we have, or even the automation tools that we use.In GenAI, we are seeing a real expansion of work. We have 270,000 people trained on GenAI, what we call GenAI aware, practitioners and experts. We are working with something like 16 different large language models. There are three big areas where we see impact. One is software development, the second is customer service, especially in operations and tech. And the third is knowledge objects – we're working with a bank in the credit area, with a pharma company in their drug discovery area, and with a telco in their product specification area – so anywhere there's knowledge objects where you can create some value from faster or more insightful ways of looking at that knowledge. We've been using these things ourselves to improve what's going on within Finacle (Infosys’s banking product). And there are several tools we built. One example is, we've taken an open-source large language model, then built a tool for ourselves on it where we can do more efficient work with Java development on a desktop. So, it completely changes the game on what we can do. We rethought all our service lines with generative AI.In software, we are seeing in the range of 15% benefits in what we are developing with our clients. In customer service, we are seeing great benefits in HR functions.Nandan is a tech visionary and he's obviously very active with us. We are fortunate in that. We want to be more aligned with where clients are going, and that was the change we made. AI-first is understanding that clients want to make changes faster internally. Internally, we have an app, InfyMe, which all of us use for internal things. We have an AI assistant that helps us, whether it's with sales, delivery, HR, or training. We feel quite good about this. We want to make sure we're doing what clients are looking for. A few years ago, there was a much stronger move to digital and cloud. That is still very much part of it. Today, there's much more of an interest in GenAI, and that's how we're changing our company. Our view is that technology will change in five years and Quantum might be the big thing. We will be more aligned to that because that's what our clients are looking for.The revenues are already beyond the PoCs. They're not just trial pilots. They're not large projects, but they're real projects with real impact. We have already been tracking what is generative AI, revenue and so on. At some stage over the next few quarters, we will start to call it out externally. I think a lot of things can be broadly put into AI. So, we are careful to make sure we are measuring GenAI the same way we did with digital. Every project is marked internally, so that we know it's an auditable process.Clients view GenAI as transformative. There are more revenue growth opportunities because you can go faster into some markets. You can do cost efficiency because you can do things better. So, there are three big advantages – revenue, cost and time. When we started digital, the cloud was one piece of it. But today it is the biggest piece in digital.The cleaner the data that is training it, the lesser the hallucination. But in normal life, we hallucinate – forget GenAI, we as people, when we are interacting, we may make some mistakes. So, there is nothing unusual about that. The idea is to reduce and not let that error contaminate other things. Today, there is no usage which is coming to what is called critical system usage, because people are waiting to see how the hallucination can be reduced further. But if you're doing it in different areas -- error mapping and making people more productive -- then you're already in a better place.We don't see them when we compete in the tech world. I think our strength, as you said, is we are very tech oriented. So, if you're a CIO looking to make a choice on who to give your technology work to, I think there are very few options outside of Infosys. Very few CIOs are going to pick someone who is not as strong as Infosys in the tech area. For large companies looking to get technology delivery done with the lowest risk, I think Infosys is the best choice going forward.In cybersecurity, we believe we are well covered, but we must highlight all the risks cybersecurity inherently has. We have security operations centres in multiple locations around the world where we support clients. Cyber is a growing area where we see clients have more needs. But there are also continuous threat actors which we must be watchful about.We gave an update a few days ago with the disclosure in the market. There is no new update from that time.","Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys, talks to TOI about the Indian tech industry's focus on AI and GCC.

'U in UPS stands for Modi govt's U-turns': Congress' dig at Centre's Unified Pension Scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/u-in-ups-stands-for-modi-govts-u-turns-congress-dig-at-centres-unified-pension-scheme/articleshow/112777558.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress party criticised the government's announcement of the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) on Sunday, alleging that it signifies another “U-turn” by the Modi administration.The opposition party's criticism came a day after the Union Cabinet approved an assured pension of 50 percent of salary for individuals who joined the service under the National Pension System (NPS) after January 1, 2004.The new scheme, introduced ahead of upcoming assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, assures an assured pension of 50 per cent of the last drawn salary.Addressing the issue, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “The 'U' in UPS stands for Modi govt's U-turns!

Moreover, inflation indexation will apply to the assured pension, assured family pension, and the assured minimum pension.With these additions, the Unified Pension Scheme transforms the National Pension System, which earlier promised pensions based on contributions from both employees and the government.This change comes amidst several non-BJP states reverting to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and similar demands from employee organisations in other regions.NPS was implemented for all government employees, except for those in the armed forces, who began serving the central government on or after January 1, 2004.Under the Old Pension Scheme, retired government employees received 50 percent of their last drawn salary as monthly pensions, which increased with DA rate hikes.

IMD predicted heavy rainfall, red alerts

NEW DELHI: Heavy rains over the weekend caused widespread flooding across Gujarat , blocking state highways and village roads, the continuous downpour over the past 48 hours inundated low-lying areas, disrupted daily life and hindered traffic flow, officials said.Several hundred people were evacuated and moved to safer locations from the districts of Valsad and Navsari as heavy rainfall battered southern Gujarat on Saturday and Sunday, officials added.According to the State Emergency Operation Centre , Vapi taluka in Valsad district experienced the highest rainfall in Gujarat, with 326 millimeters recorded in a 24-hour period until 6 am on Sunday. Khergam in Navsari also received significant rainfall, measuring 248 mm since 6 am.The heavy rains have severely impacted several districts, including Valsad, Surat, Tapi, Navsari and Narmada, as per official reports. As a precautionary measure, over 600 individuals living in low-lying areas of Valsad were evacuated to safer locations due to the heavy downpour.Chief minister Bhupendra Patel , in telephonic conversations with district collectors from the rain-affected areas, directed them to take all necessary steps to provide relief to residents, including timely evacuations and ensuring the safety of livestock.The chief minister said that State and National Disaster Response Forces (SDRF and NDRF) teams were deployed and ready to assist as needed. Due to ongoing rainfall in the catchment areas, the water level of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada dam rose sharply, reaching 135.30 meters on Sunday, just a few meters below its full capacity of 138.68 meters, officials reported.Executive Magistrate (Disaster), Navsari AM Gamit said: ""A total of 17 persons were shifted to Bilimora city after flooding in low-lying areas. The administration is also keeping a close watch on rising water levels of Purna and Kaveri rivers.”According to SSNNL officials , the dam reservoir was receiving 2,65,748 cusecs of water from upstream, leading to the opening of 15 radial gates to manage the discharge.""While 1,75,000 cusecs water was flowing out through the gates, 36,975 cusecs water was being released into the river from the riverbed powerhouse and 23,081 cusecs from canal head powerhouse,"" an SSNNL official added.As of Sunday, Gujarat's 206 reservoirs contained a total of 3.64 lakh million cubic feet of water, which accounts for 65 percent of their overall storage capacity, according to officials. Among these reservoirs, 72 were put on high alert, while 15 were put on alert due to a significant increase in their water levels.This season, Gujarat has received 81.81 per cent of its average annual rainfall. The southern region of the state has received 97.52 per cent, followed by Kutch at 90.18 per cent and Saurashtra at 84.92 per cent.However, data from the SEOC indicates that the northern and east-central regions of Gujarat have experienced lower rainfall compared to the southern part and Saurashtra-Kutch, while north Gujarat has received 64.91 percent of its average annual rainfall so far, while east-central Gujarat has recorded 68.84 percent.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted intense rainfall in several regions of Gujarat until Tuesday morning. According to the forecast, districts in south Gujarat, including Vadodara, Surat, Bharuch, Navsari, and Valsad, along with Amreli and Bhavnagar in the Saurashtra region, are expected to experience 'heavy to very heavy' rain, with isolated 'extremely heavy' rain.Furthermore, the IMD has also forecasted 'heavy to very heavy' rain accompanied by isolated 'extremely heavy' rain in the districts of Anand, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Morbi, Dwarka, and Kutch on Tuesday.IMD had issued a red alert, cautioning that ""extremely heavy rainfall may occur"" in the state on Sunday.In addition to Gujarat, the IMD has also issued red alerts for various other regions across the country.

'Bound to happen but ... ': BJP hits out at Rahul Gandhi over his caste remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bound-to-happen-but-bjp-hits-out-at-rahul-gandhi-over-his-caste-remarks/articleshow/112782690.cms,"'Shedding crocodile tears'

'Shows the poor thinking of Rahul Gandhi'

NEW DELHI: Union minister Giriraj Singh on Sunday said that a caste census is unavoidable and will be carried out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the right time. The Union Minister questioned why Rahul Gandhi continued to demand a national caste census when the Congress government in Karnataka is yet to release the results of the caste census conducted in the state.""Rahul Gandhi stays away from ground reality and does politics of perception. Caste census has been done in Karnataka, yet the Congress government there has not declared it. When it's time for the country, PM Modi will get it done,"" Giriraj Singh said.During an event in Prayagraj on Saturday, Rahul Gandhi had claimed that around 90% of the population remains disconnected from the system, despite possessing the necessary skills and talents, which is the reason behind the demand for a caste census.“90% of the people are not a part of the system. They have the required skill, talent but they are not connected with the system. That's why we are demanding a caste census. BJP leaders are saying that an OBC section will be given after the caste census,” Rahul had said.Singh continued his attack on Rahul Gandhi, claiming that he was out of touch with his own identity and incapable of fulfilling promises made to the backward communities. ""Rahul Gandhi, who cannot tell his religion or caste, cannot declare the caste census done in Karnataka. Only Modi will ensure benefits to the backward and extremely backward communities, not Rahul Gandhi's perception of politics,"" the Union minister said.Union minister Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan) Singh accused Rahul Gandhi of shedding ""crocodile tears"" over the caste census issue. Lalan Singh alleged that Gandhi's concern was not genuine, and said that when Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar carried out a caste census, Rahul did not support it.""Rahul Gandhi is very concerned about the caste census. When Nitish Kumar conducted the census in Bihar and at that time we were in INDIA, then 2 meetings were held, we said that a resolution should be passed on the caste census. But he did not pass the resolution under pressure from Mamata Banerjee. Today he is shedding crocodile tears. When we got the census done, has Rahul Gandhi ever praised it in Bihar to date? He is just giving a slogan to confuse the public,"" he said.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya slammed Rahul Gandhi's remarks about the Miss India list, which Gandhi claimed did not include any Dalit, Adivasi (tribal), or OBC women. Malviya said that these comments reflect the childish mentality of the Leader of the Opposition. According to Malviya, Gandhi's remarks suggest a form of discriminatory attitude that implies women from SC/ST/OBC backgrounds are unable to succeed in beauty pageants like Miss India.""It is understandable that a 54 year old middle aged person is going through the list of Miss India. But it is not understandable that he is looking for caste in it. This childish mentality shows the poor thinking of Rahul Gandhi. A kind of perverse sexism according to which girls of SC/ST/OBC community cannot move forward in competitions like Miss India,"" Malviya said in a post on X.""Those Congress workers who were sitting in front and whistling and enjoying themselves like ruffians were more foolish than Rahul Gandhi who failed for the third time,"" the post added.Rahul while speaking at the 'Samvidhan Samman Sammelan' in Prayagraj had said, ""I have checked the list of Miss India, which did not have any Dalit, Adivasi (tribal) or OBC women. Some will talk about cricket or Bollywood. No one will show the cobbler or plumber.

""Unless we demolish the entire network or chain, we cannot control the illegal trade of narcotics. It's an international problem. In India, we need to create more awareness and fight against it.

Future of Bangladesh's textile industry amidst political uncertainty

Bangladesh's textile industry, a significant contributor to GDP and employment, faces uncertainty following Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Her tenure saw infrastructure improvements, special economic zones, and labour reforms that boosted exports. Political instability now threatens foreign investment, trade relations, and labour peace, raising concerns about the industry's future resilience and growth.

NEW DELHI: Expressing satisfaction over the response to his recent exhortation from Red Fort to connect over one lakh youth without a political pedigree with politics, PM Narendra Modi , in his monthly radio talk ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Sunday said a large number of youth, keen to join politics, were looking for the right opportunity and guidance.“I have also received letters from youth across the country on this subject.Enormous response is being received on social media as well. People have sent me many kinds of suggestions. Some youth have written in their letters that it is truly inconceivable for them. On account of the absence of a political legacy on the part of their grandfather or parents they could not enter politics despite wanting to join,” the PM said.Citing a few responses to his Red Fort call, Modi said some youth had written that they possessed good experience working at the ground level and, hence, they could help solve people’s problems.“Some youth have also written that dynastic politics crushes new talent. Some youth have mentioned that such efforts will lend more strength to our democracy. I thank everyone for sending in suggestions on the subject. I hope that now with our collective efforts, youth who do not possess a political background will also be able to come forward in politics... their experience and their fervour will prove useful for the country,” Modi said.He recalled the freedom movement and said many people without a political background had come forward and took the plunge for the sake of India’s freedom. “Once more, we require the same spirit to attain the goal of Viksit Bharat. I shall urge all my young friends to positively join this campaign. This step of yours will be transformative in terms of your future and the country’s future,” the PM said.He also hailed people for the success of ‘Har Ghar Tiranga’ campaign and said when people join hands to express a sentiment, it lends unparalleled glory to any campaign.","PM Modi discussed India's progress toward a 'Viksit Bharat' and highlighted the positive response to his call for young people to join politics.

Maharashtra becomes 1st state to offer Unified Pension Scheme to employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-becomes-1st-state-to-offer-ups-to-employees/articleshow/112788305.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hours after central government employees ' organisations demanded that state governments implement the Unified Pension Scheme ( UPS ), poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday became the first state to offer a switch to its employees amid expectation that others, especially those governed by NDA, will follow suit.The decision came 24 hours after Union cabinet approved UPS to offer 50% of an employee's average salary for the last 12 months as pension, along with inflation adjustment and other sweeteners to address the demands of govt employees who joined in 2004 and later.While 23 lakh central govt employees stand to benefit from Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), the number may rise to 90 lakh if all states offer it. Urging states to implement the scheme, top representatives of central govt employees said political parties should not politicise the issue. Though they said OPS is the best option as it did not require employees to make any contribution, they are satisfied with UPS.“We should be practical to see what best we can get and govt can provide. UPS incorporates 90% of the provisions of OPS and so we are happy. Govt is working on a lump sum amount that employees covered by UPS will get at the time of their retirement from their monthly contribution,” said Shiv Gopal Mishra of All India Railwaymen’s Federation and secretary (staff side) of national council of JCM.Mishra said in the current scenario, nothing could be a better solution than UPS. He said since state govt employees and their associations are also part of the agitation to get a fair deal for all those recruited from Jan 2004 onwards, they will also pursue state governments to implement this quickly.Cabinet secretary-designate T V Somanathan, who headed the panel to review NPS & held negotiations with staff organisations, said on Saturday that Centre’s UPS template can be replicated by states. He had said that over 99% of the employees covered under NPS would find it beneficial to shift to UPS.JCM chief M Raghavaiah said staff body expected more states to implement UPS and urged Centre and the states to guarantee pension of 50% of the salary for those who have served 20 years in place of 25 years. He said the lump sum amount to be paid at the time of retirement should be one-fourth of monthly pay of past six months.Sources said UPS will benefit over eight lakh railways employees who have joined service in past 20 years. “Welfare of govt employees should be an issue of ‘they vs us’ for political parties as we work for organisations irrespective of which party is in power,” said a senior representative when asked about Congress taking potshots at BJP.","Poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday became the first state to offer a switch to its employees amid expectation that others, especially those governed by NDA, will follow suit.

Not only must the culprit be sternly punished for committing such crimes, but all those who try to protect them must be dealt with an iron hand,"" he said at a ' Lakhpati Didi ' convention in north Maharashtra's Jalgaon.Although he didn't refer to any specific case, his remarks hold weight following the recent rape-murder of a PG resident doctor in Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and the rape of two minor girls in Badlapur. Both sparked nationwide outrage.PM Modi expressed his empathy for the anger and pain felt by women across the country. He warned that police, doctors, and school representatives protecting culprits should not be spared.A message must go from top to bottom that such acts ( crime against women ) will not be tolerated, PM Modi said. He also underlined the responsibility of state govts, political parties and society to prevent crimes against women.“Govts will come and go but crime against women must be tackled with an iron hand at all costs,” he said. He assured that Centre is ready to support state govts in addressing such crimes.PM PM Modi highlighted new provisions in Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) that ensure tough penalties for crime against women, including hanging and life imprisonment. “In my mission of Viksit Bharat, the country’s women are playing an important role and hence, there is a need to further empower them. But there is also a simultaneous need to ensure theirsafety and security ,” the PM said.The event organised by Maharashtra govt honoured women under Union govt’s Lakhpati Didi scheme, which recognises self-help group (SHG) members who earn an annual household income of Rs 1 lakh or more. PM Modi handed certificates to 11 lakh new Lakhpati Didis and released a revolving fund of Rs 2,500 crore for 48 lakh SHG members. Bank loans worth Rs 5,000 crore were disbursed to benefit over 25 lakh SHG members.PM Modi said Lakhpati Didi scheme is designed to make women financially stable. “Compare the work done by opposition in 60 years and initiatives that our govt had taken in one decade. Till 2014, Centre had given bank loans to Sakhi Mandals amounting to Rs 25,000 crore. In contrast, our govt gave bank loans of Rs 9 lakh crore,” he said.“The state is playing an important role in our Viksit Bharat initiative. Mahayuti govt should remain in office for a long time.

However, the work done till July in 2024-25 is 23 crore person-days fewer than in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, marking an improvement this year, according to statistics provided by the Union rural development ministry .Fiscal 2019-20 is considered a normal year under MGNREGS as the employment pattern followed the predictable variables of work demand , before it was upended by the pandemic which resulted in a national lockdown and halting of the economy. It witnessed a record rise in job demand under the distress employment programme.The work done in 2020-21 shot through the roof with a record over 389 crore person-days. It came down marginally in 2021-22 at just over 363 crore, and further to around 294 crore in 2022-23. The improvement, with a dip in MGNREGS work performance, was expected as the economy opened up with rollback of the lockdown, resulting in return of workers to traditional centres of employment.The person-days generated between April-July in 2024-25 stands at 127.9 crore, as against 150.2 crore in the same month in 2023-24. In contrast, 114.8 crore person-days were recorded in 2019-20.Crucially, the 150 crore person-days mark in April-July last year was unexpectedly high as the lockdown had been rolled back over two years ago. The person-days in 2023-24 ended the downward graph, and rose to 308 crore.The budget allocation in 2024-25 is over Rs 19,000 crore less than the expenditure incurred in the scheme in 2023-24, but may be enough to feed the work demand if the present trend holds. However, civil society experts working the ground say the introduction of national mobile monitoring software for marking attendance has hurt workers and played a role in bringing down demand, as has Aadhaar-based payment system.","The work done till July in 2024-25 is 23 crore person-days fewer than in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

Similarly, the monthly pension payment does not factor in the impact of dearness relief, the adjustment for inflation, that govt promised to all employees who joined service from 2004 and are part of NPS.Currently, there are three pension fund managers for govt employees - SBI, LIC and UTI - offering three schemes. Since inception in April 2008, the highest return of 9.75% is offered to central govt employees by SBI pension fund, while for the state govts, LIC Pension Fund offered the highest return of 9.56% since June 2009, according to data on the NPS Trust website.Similarly, UTI Pension Fund has assumed 6% annual return on annuities, against 5.6% to over 7% currently offered by insurance companies.Under existing rules, govt employees have three investment options with the default option, used by 95% of the subscribers, allowing up to 65% investment in govt securities, 15% in equities and the remaining in corporate debt. There is also the option to invest the entire money in g-secs and a third one - Moderate Life Cycle Fund - which allows those up to 35 years to invest 50% of the corpus in equities, 30% in corporate bonds and the remaining 20% in g-secs. The allocation towards equities falls 2% annually once the subscriber turns 35 and by the time she is 55 years, 80% is invested in g-secs with the remaining 20% allowed to be split equally between equities and corporate bonds.Fund managers said that to earn 50% of the average salary for 12 months the corpus needs to be large and with the 14% contribution by govt the objective would not have been met, prompting an increase to 18.5%. Also, employee contribution has been retained at 10%. Going forward, govt may have to increase its share of the contribution in case market returns fall.""UPS is good for retiring employees. But they will miss the opportunity to potentially earn even higher returns,"" said D Swarup, former chairman of Pension Fund Regulator and Development Authority.

Intermodal Bus Station Project: Intermodal bus station project to make headway after a lull in Tirupati,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intermodal-bus-station-project-to-make-headway-after-a-lull-in-tirupati/articleshow/112785919.cms,"TIRUPATI: After facing delays for over two years, the ambitious Intermodal bus station project in Tirupati is finally poised to become a reality.In a significant development, national highways logistics management limited ( NHLML ) CEO Prakash Gaur and project director Pooja Mishra visited Tirupati on Sunday. Accompanied by Tirupati MP Dr M Gurumoorthy, they conducted a review meeting at the existing bus stand and inspected the premises.Following a recent meeting of Tirupati MP with union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, the union minister assured that the tender process of the Tirupati intermodal bus station project will be completed within a month.The project, which aims to address Tirupati's growing transportation needs , has been redesigned from its initial 15-storey plan to an 11-floor structure. This adjustment came in response to objections raised by the municipal corporation of Tirupati's town planning department, which had previously stalled the project's groundbreaking ceremony.The proposed intermodal station will be built on a 13-acre centrally located site, designed to alleviate road congestion by integrating various transit modes. The facility will feature a passenger terminal, bus terminal, parking facilities for cars and two-wheelers, a helipad, and a ropeway. Additional amenities will include retail zones, a food court, hotel, passenger lounge, devotee counters, medical facilities, and an EV charging station.Dr Gurumurthy emphasized that the new bus stand is being designed with future passenger needs in mind, incorporating modern features and spiritual elements. He also mentioned that a foot-over bridge and sky walk would connect the bus stand to the railway station, enhancing inter-modal connectivity.The project's necessity is underscored by the current RTC central bus station 's overcrowding, which serves an average of 1,70,000 passengers and 4,000 buses daily. With Tirupati's ever-increasing pilgrim footfall, the existing infrastructure can no longer meet the growing demand.","The ambitious Intermodal bus station project in Tirupati is finally poised to become a reality.

The administration's appeal highlights a dual commitment to both patient care and the safety of healthcare professionals .AIIMS Director Dr. V Srinivas remarked, ""The entire AIIMS family stands behind the cause of safety of all healthcare professionals at the premier hospital and across the country.""""However, as doctors, our supreme duty is also to ensure that patients visiting our portals do not go unattended,"" he added.To address the security concerns, AIIMS has decided to conduct a comprehensive internal security audit.Dr. V Srinivas stated, ""The administration has decided to undertake a collaborative internal security audit at AIIMS, New Delhi with regard to the safety and security of healthcare professionals, staff, patients, and visitors and to facilitate the same, a 15-member committee has been constituted.""This committee, led by Dr. Puneet Kaur, Head of the Department of Biophysics, includes representatives from FAIIMS, the Resident Doctors Association, the Students Union, the Nurses Union, and the Society of Young Scientists.The committee will visit various AIIMS campuses, including outreach locations like NCI Jhajjar in Haryana, NDDTC Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, and CRHSP Ballabgarh in Haryana, during both day and night time to inspect and evaluate current security measures.They aim to identify any additional safety protocols needed and will submit their recommendations promptly.In the meantime, AIIMS has announced the installation of AI-enabled CCTV cameras at critical entry and exit points of the Mother and Child Block.An office order elaborated,""The Director AIIMS has taken multiple rounds of the hospital campus and has noted that many times same external persons are found entering and exiting various buildings under the garb of patient attendants, delivery agents, etc. thereby arousing suspicion of such persons being touts or impersonators visiting the campus frequently.""The order also noted that current security staff face challenges in identifying frequent unauthorized visitors due to shift work, which can lead to inconveniences for genuine guests and patients.The new AI-enabled CCTV cameras will utilize facial recognition technology to help security staff monitor and control access, identifying frequent visitors and unauthorized personnel more effectively.The office order specified, ""It has been decided to install AI-enabled CCTV cameras at key entry and exit points of Mother and Child Block on a pilot basis. Such cameras shall be able to recognize all visitors with facial recognition technology and shall help security staff to identify which all persons are entering and exiting frequently thereby helping them in access control of unauthorized personnel.""In addition to these measures, a four-member committee consisting of the Dean (Academic), Dean (Research), Medical Superintendent, and Chief Security Officer has been formed to address immediate security concerns raised by AIIMS healthcare professionals.The resident doctors’ strike, now in its tenth day, has led to the suspension of elective services in several government hospitals across New Delhi.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Musk in the White House? Trump floats Elon as US government 'fat cutter' extraordinaire; Watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-in-the-white-house-trump-floats-elon-as-us-government-fat-cutter-extraordinaire-watch-video/articleshow/112791990.cms,"In the latest twist in the ever-evolving relationship between former President Donald Trump and tech titan Elon Musk , Trump has revealed his interest in having Musk help ""cut out some of the fat"" in government if he wins the upcoming election.While it’s unlikely that Musk will serve in a Trump cabinet due to his commitments at Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), Trump has expressed a desire to involve Musk in some capacity—particularly in streamlining government operations and addressing the challenges of artificial intelligence.During a recent interview with former Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan, Trump discussed Musk’s potential role in his administration. “We have to cherish our geniuses,” Trump said, referring to Musk. “He’s a brilliant guy, and what he really would like to do is get involved in cutting some of the fat.”However, Trump also acknowledged that Musk’s responsibilities with his companies might prevent him from taking on a formal cabinet position. “He’s running big businesses and all that, so I don’t think he could be cabinet,” Trump said, suggesting instead that Musk could serve as a consultant.Trump highlighted Musk’s potential contributions in the realm of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the importance of staying competitive with other global powers. “He could consult on AI ... It’s very important for the country. If we don’t do it, China’s gonna do it, or somebody else,” Trump said.So, what exactly would Musk do? According to Trump, Elon would serve as a sort of high-level consultant, focusing on streamlining government operations and tackling the ever-looming AI challenge. “He could consult on AI... It’s very important for the country. If we don’t do it, China’s gonna do it, or somebody else,” Trump warned, leaning into the competitive narrative that has increasingly defined his pitch to voters.“Elon and I have a great relationship. He’s great,” Trump also said, adding with typical flair, “He’s a totally unusual character...But he is a brilliant guy.”This marks a significant development in the relationship between Trump and Musk, who had previously engaged in public disagreements but have since aligned more closely, particularly as Musk has become more involved in right-wing politics. Musk recently endorsed Trump and played a role in forming a pro-Trump super PAC earlier this year.","Former President Donald Trump has expressed interest in having tech titan Elon Musk help ""cut out some of the fat"" in government if he wins the upcoming election.

Harris uttered those words to his young daughter more than 50 years ago, he was encouraging her to whip freely through the parks of Oakland, California, not seek the highest elected office in the country. But in her address accepting the nomination as the Democratic presidential nominee , Vice-Prez Kamala Harris said it was these words that helped inspire her.""From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless,"" Harris said.It was a rare homage to her father, a prominent economist but fleeting figure in her life who has largely been a footnote in her personal and political story. The first black scholar to receive tenure in Stanford University 's economics department, Donald Harris remains a professor emeritus there, and turned 86 the day after his daughter gave the most important speech of her life at the Democratic National Convention. He was not among the family members who accompanied Harris to the convention.Her relationship with her father is a closely guarded part of Harris' life about which she has spoken only sparingly. Her 2019 memoir, ""The Truths We Hold"", referenced him only a handful of times. But in presenting herself as a nominee who understands the American dream through the complex lenses of personal, familial and social struggles, she tapped into the totality of the experiences that forged her.Harris has been clear, however, that she is her mother's daughter.

"Hurricane Hone: Hurricane Hone lashes Hawaii's Big Island with furious waves and flooding, thousands lose power",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hurricane-hone-lashes-hawaiis-big-island-with-furious-waves-and-flooding-thousands-lose-power/articleshow/112790821.cms,"Officials report minimal damage

Forecast and community response

Hurricane Gilma remains a concern

Hurricane Hone passed within 60 miles of Hawaii's Big Island early Sunday, bringing heavy rain , causing power outages for thousands of customers and damaging native vegetation. About 15,000 residents in a region with a roughly 206,000 population were left without electricity.Mitch Roth, the mayor of Hawaii County , reported there were no injuries or major damages.Kazuo Todd, the fire chief for Hawaii County, highlighted that nearly 18 inches of rain had fallen around the southern island volcanoes, although the winds and flooding had not been severe.Adding further, Todd said, “We do live on an island in the Pacific where the water can drain off into the ocean relatively quickly,”.Forecasters anticipated Hone, a Category 1 storm moving westward below the islands, could still deliver up to 20 inches of rain in some regions. The storm’s progression is expected to slow and accumulate moisture over the islands, which could heighten the risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding statewide.For many residents, Hone did not prompt significant worry. On Saturday evening, a local baseball league primarily composed of older adults held its banquet at Kamehameha Park in Kapaau, shielding attendees from gusts with windscreens.Other residents paid closer attention to the rain. Kumiko Mattison drove from her home in Kaumana to Keaukaha near the water. Despite observing swollen water bodies and rising tides during her drive, she found no damage to wetland areas and fishponds upon her arrival.In Nanawale Estates, roughly 20 miles south, Sean O’Phelan was concerned about potential tree uprootings around his small cabin due to the rain and wind. O’Phelan, who lives off the electrical grid and utilises solar power and a rainwater storage tank, had tree damage his carport during a storm less than a year ago.“We’re all pretty confident that we’ll be able to share aloha with our neighbours and make sure that everybody’s safe,” O’Phelan stated, noting the community’s readiness to support one another during disasters.On Friday, Hawaii Electric, the state’s primary electricity utility , prepared to shut off power in high wildfire-risk areas to prevent potential fires fueled by strong winds. However, by late Saturday, the National Weather Service had lifted the wildfire warning, leading the utility to retract potential power shut-offs.Residents also monitored Hurricane Gilma, a Category 3 storm east of Hawaii, although forecasters expected it to weaken to a tropical depression before reaching the state.Meteorologist Ian Morrison from the National Weather Service in Honolulu expressed hope that Gilma’s rainfall would be distributed over a day or two rather than in a rapid downpour.","Hurricane Hone passed within 60 miles of Hawaii's Big Island early Sunday.

At the time, Nepali officials said that they had resorted to the ban after TikTok declined to address concerns about troubling content.A spokesperson for TikTok expressed satisfaction with the move, saying, ""We're excited to be able to continue enabling Nepali voices and creativity.""The decision to reinstate TikTok signalled Oli's belief that, amid the geopolitical bickering between China and India, Nepal's neighbour to the south that also banned the app, the Himalayan country was better off aligning with China.TikTok and many other Chinese apps have been banned in India since 2020, amid historically fraught relations between the two countries and more recent efforts to dominate the South Asian region.Prithvi Subba Gurung, a Nepalese govt spokesperson, said TikTok would now have to abide by certain directives, such as naming a point of contact in the country. ""We have set a few conditions such as TikTok to be used for promoting Nepali tourism, supporting us for digital safety, digital literacy and digital education and curb hate content,"" he said.On Thursday, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, Chen Song, wrote on social media platform X, ""Today is a good day,"" which many Nepalese took to mean that the talks to reinstate TikTok had been finalised.","The popular social media app, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, was banned for its refusal to curb what the previous Nepalese govt had described as hate speech.

""It is a great relief.""The elevated train network was closed in mid-July during the student-led protest.In the deadly violence -- which would see hundreds of people killed until Hasina quit and fled the country by helicopter on August 5 -- the stations were vandalised by a mob.- Return to normal -The resumption of metro services is a key sign of a return to normal daily life.Its reopening was ordered by the new caretaker government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus , 84.""In the absence of the metro I had to take the bus to work,"" said Kaosar Khan, a speech therapist at a private hospital in the city.""I faced massive traffic snarls,"" Khan, 25, added. ""It used to take two hours on the bus, but with the metro, I can reach my destination in 15 minutes"".Hasina's government was accused of widespread abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of political opponents.But Dhaka's metro, inaugurated in 2022, is seen by many as one of the most significant infrastructure endeavours of Hasina's otherwise tarnished tenure.It was an instant hit in the congested city where commuting by road is a source of massive frustration.- 'Why hurt the nation?' -Local researchers say the capital's economy loses upwards of $3 billion each year in lost work time due to traffic jams , often worsened by regular street protests and monsoonal downpours.Pictures released by Hasina's office while she was still in office showed her weeping at the sight of a vandalised metro station in an outlying Dhaka suburb.Hasina had called the line a ""matter of great pride"" when she opened it in December 2022, and during the protests, she was furious that it had been attacked.""Who has benefitted... Do I ride on the metro?"" she asked at the time.But others said Hasina's government had exploited the attack on the metro, to shut it down as a warning.""They wanted to say if you go against us, you will have to suffer the consequences,"" said Mohammad Hridoy, 28, a technology worker waiting at the platform.""The shutdown seemed more deliberate than necessitated by circumstances.""On Sunday, some passengers said the metro attack was a blot on the reputation of the protesters.""Why hurt the nation and destroy public property?"" said Sharmin Sultana, 55, a housewife travelling with her young daughter, a yellow scarf covering her head.""We should protect our national property, irrespective of party politics.""",Bangladesh's metro railway in the notoriously congested capital Dhaka resumed Sunday.

'Brace for tough times ahead': UK PM Keir Starmer prepares nation for a difficult road to recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/brace-for-tough-times-ahead-uk-pm-keir-starmer-prepares-nation-for-a-difficult-road-to-recovery/articleshow/112770516.cms,"In a pivotal speech set for Tuesday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer will address the nation with a stark message: the path to resolving Britain's deep-seated issues will be long and arduous. The newly elected leader, who swept into power in July, plans to offer an unvarnished assessment of the challenges ahead, warning, ""things will get worse before we get better.""Since his landslide victory, Starmer has not shied away from laying blame for the country's dire circumstances at the feet of the previous Conservative government.He argues that their mismanagement and neglect have created a breeding ground for social unrest , including the recent wave of anti-migrant riots . These riots, sparked by the false attribution of three young girls' deaths in northern England to an Islamist migrant, have exposed the fractures within British society—a situation Starmer has said will be addressed head-on.Starmer's speech will outline the extensive problems his government is inheriting, from overcrowded prisons to the beleaguered National Health Service (NHS), plagued by lengthy waiting lists. But he will caution that any meaningful change will require time.""I said change would not happen overnight. When there is rot deep in the heart of a structure, you can't just cover it up. You can't tinker with it or rely on quick fixes. You have to overhaul the entire thing,"" Starmer will say, Reuters reported quoting excerpts of his speech provided by his office.This candid approach is expected to set the tone for Starmer's premiership, one defined by transparency and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths. According to excerpts from his speech provided by his office, he will emphasize the need for honesty about the difficult choices ahead. ""Frankly, things will get worse before we get better,"" he will state, signaling a government prepared to make tough decisions in the face of public discontent.The Prime Minister's warning comes on the heels of a turbulent month in British politics. Earlier this August, Starmer was forced to cancel his summer holiday to address the riots that gripped parts of the nation. The violence, which targeted Muslim and migrant communities, was a grim reminder of the societal divisions exacerbated by years of what Starmer describes as ""populism and failure.""In a pointed critique of the previous government, Starmer will argue that the rioters who took to the streets did so not just because they were angry, but because they knew the system was broken. ""And those people throwing rocks, torching cars, making threats, they didn't just know the system was broken. They were betting on it, they were gaming it, they saw the cracks in our society after 14 years of populism and failure and they exploited them. That's what we have inherited,"" he will assert.Despite the daunting task ahead, Starmer will appeal directly to Britain's working people—teachers, nurses, small business owners, and firefighters—who he believes are the backbone of the nation. He will argue that his government has already begun to take the first steps towards the change that voters demanded in July. However, he will also stress the gravity of the country's financial situation, with an expected overspend of £22 billion ($29 billion) this year, which will necessitate some unpopular measures.","Keir Starmer, Britain's new Prime Minister, will address the nation on Tuesday.

Prince Andrew Eviction: Why King Charles want to evict Prince Andrew from Royal Lodge?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-king-charles-want-to-evict-prince-andrew-from-royal-lodge/articleshow/112757073.cms,"There is speculation that the Royal Lodge could become home to another royal if Prince Andrew faces eviction from his Windsor residence. Amid financial concerns over the costs of maintaining the 30-bedroom home, thought to be worth £30 million, King Charles is reportedly planning to withdraw private funding for security on the estate, which currently costs £3 million a year, the Daily Mail reported.This could force the Duke of York to move out unless he can generate the financial resources needed for repairs and security.King Charles' decision to stop funding security adds to the financial pressure that Prince Andrew, 64, faced last year when struggling to meet the £400,000-a-year upkeep costs for the Royal Lodge.The Crown Estate , which owns the property, deems it appropriate for Royal Lodge to remain under the Royal Family 's occupancy. This situation has led to friends of the Yorks suggesting another reason behind the eviction.Daily Mail’s editor, Richard Eden , wrote in his column, ""Intriguingly, more than one friend of the Yorks has suggested the same theory to me as to why this eviction ‘campaign’ has begun,” the Daily Mail's diary editor wrote. “Could it be that the King sees Royal Lodge as a potential future home for Queen Camilla , were she to outlive him?""Back in 2003, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson paid £1 million for a 75-year lease on the property. Despite their divorce in 1996, the couple still live at Royal Lodge, each occupying different wings. The Duke and Duchess of York are currently atBalmoral Castle with King Charles for the annual summer retreat. Richard Eden, speaking on Palace Confidential, hinted at potential tension among the royals during this summer period in Scotland.""The crown estate owns the property, there's no great reason to get rid of him other than the costs of security which the King is paying for,” Eden said. “But, the King has a lot of money and it just seems petty that he is trying to get rid of him.""As the royals spend their time engaging in activities like grouse shooting, salmon fishing, and picnics, the future of Royal Lodge and Prince Andrew's residence there remains uncertain. The Duke and Duchess of York's presence at Balmoral for the retreat might prompt discussions on the matter between Prince Andrew and King Charles.","King Charles is reportedly planning to withdraw private funding for security on the estate, which currently costs £3 million a year.

Is Prince Harry growing angry and frustrated in US? Here's what his friends have to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-prince-harry-growing-angry-and-frustrated-in-us-heres-what-his-friends-have-to-say/articleshow/112754354.cms,"Prince Harry , the Duke of Sussex , has been described as “an angry boy” living in America, according to one of his close friends. The 39-year-old royal has resided in the United States for over four years since he and his wife, Meghan Markle , 43, stepped away from their roles as senior members of the British royal family . However, according to those close to him, Harry’s once robust circle of friends is slowly dwindling.In a recent interview with The Sunday Times of London, one of Harry’s oldest friends shared insights into the prince's state of mind.“He’s an angry boy,” the friend said. “Things haven’t turned out how he wanted. I think he misses being over here [in Britain] desperately and wants to be admired more. Anyone who knows him feels he’d rather be top of the pops here with everyone loving him, as they do with [his older brother] William and Kate.”The friend added that Harry is one of the few who still receives “the odd WhatsApp” message from the Duke, indicating how much his social connections have thinned out since relocating to California.Harry and Meghan’s decision to leave royal life behind and move to the US was followed by a series of high-profile projects, including their six-part Netflix documentary, their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, and Harry’s revealing memoir, Spare. These public ventures have sparked considerable controversy, particularly within the UK, and have reportedly strained Harry’s relationships with many of his former friends.Another of Harry’s friends expressed dismay over the Duke’s willingness to share private details about his life within the royal family. “I can’t believe he’d stoop so low,” the friend said. “It’s outrageously disloyal. Oprah, Netflix, and then the book? Three strikes and you’re out.”The friend continued, “Harry and Meghan could have left with dignity and decency and not trashed the institution. The conclusion is they’ve made money from trashing his family.”The fallout from Harry’s actions has been noticeable. As one source close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed, “Harry and Meghan could have left with dignity and decency and not trashed the institution. The conclusion is they’ve made money from trashing his family.”In his Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan, Harry himself admitted to the personal cost of his choices, stating, “I miss my friends … I’ve lost a few friends in this process.” Earlier this year, Harry made headlines again when he officially renounced his British residency and declared America his home in legal paperwork.As Prince Harry continues to navigate his new life in the US, the future of his relationships with old friends and family remains uncertain.","Prince Harry's once robust circle of friends is slowly dwindling, according to friends.

G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. They called for safer working conditions for women - not just in Indian hospitals but all workplaces in India - and for the mindset towards women in India to change.Many at the London protest-vigil, held in front of the Gandhi statue in Parliament Square, were Indian-origin doctors now working in the NHS, who had trained in hospitals in Kolkata.They said safety for women was far better in Kolkata decades ago and had gone downhill and that security and facilities for female doctors in hospitals across India was terrible. They also wanted to see swifter justice handed to the culprits.One doctor spoke of how an on-call room at an AIIMS hospital in India that she visited earlier this year had a rickety bed with bed lice, rats, no lockable bathroom and no running water.“There are no restrooms in Indian hospitals and security is not effective. The police disappear when needed. The CCTV needs to be monitored. We need proper restrooms for doctors,” said Dr Tina Gupta, who studied at Calcutta National Medical College. “We never felt unsafe 20 years ago. The attitude towards women in India has changed. Men were more respectful to women before.” She also said the culture of working 36 to 48 hour shifts in hospitals needs to change.Rudra Baidyaray, an NHS surgeon, said: “When we were working in Kolkata, these things didn’t happen in the hospitals then.”His daughter Ritisha (17) said: “Nothing has improved, it has got worse. We are here to show solidarity with people in India.”India-born Sneh Sunny blamed it on the “mentality of men”. She said “They need to stop treating women as objects. I feel vulnerable in the evenings in India. I have a son and I taught him women are equal. It is our duty to teach them. We need more safety in the workplace in India, and the security cameras need to work and be monitored.”Anurag Rag (36) from UP, said: “My family, especially my mother, taught me to respect women. I have seen women treated badly in my state and it has made me want to protect women more. We want the Indian government to do something. The culture in India needs to be improved.”Dipti Jain, the organiser, said: “This is war cry – we want justice for the victim and the real culprits to be caught. We know how safe it was before in these hospitals and how much it has changed in 30 years unbelievable.”India-born Dr Annapoorna Sharma said doctors in India needed safe private restrooms with running water and separate bathrooms. She said it was disgusting it was left to the doctor’s parents to file the complaint, which should have been done by the principal of the medical school and she was concerned forensic evidence had not been collected properly.",Indian-origin men and women gathered in multiple cities across Britain on Thursday night to demand justice for the trainee female doctor raped and murdered at R.
