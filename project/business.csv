Amit Shah to launch 'Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag' for instant regional language translation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-to-launch-bharatiya-bhasha-anubhag-for-instant-regional-language-translation/articleshow/113339408.cms,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah will launch the ‘ Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag ', a special initiative of the department of official language under the ministry of home affairs, at the 4th Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan here on Saturday, enabling instant translation of official communication between the Centre and the states, from Hindi or English to regional language of the relevant state and vice versa.“Just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speeches in (non-Hindi speaking) states get instantly translated and can be heard by the public in their respective regional language, the ‘Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag’, in collaboration with Centre for Deployment of Advanced Computing ( C-DAC ), will put in place a universal translation system for official communication. For instance, if the chief minister of Tamil Nadu writes a letter to the Centre in Tamil, the Union minister here can read it in his language and have the reply sent in Tamil. This will help bring the regional languages on to the centre-stage,” secretary in department of official language Anshuli Arya told a press conference here on Friday.Arya added that the recommendations of the parliamentary committee on official language — contained in 12 reports, three of which are pending with the President of India — will, as per the procedure, be forwarded to the ministries concerned and after their comments are received, a considered decision will be taken on the way forward. She said all the recommendations are designed to uphold India’s composite culture and lay emphasis on adopting a persuasive or motivational approach, rather than a punitive approach, towards promoting the official language. It was with this spirit that the department of personnel and training (DoPT) had turned down the parliamentary panel’s recommendation to record adverse comments in annual confidential report (ACR) of officers who failed to meet targets for official communication in Hindi, informed Arya.Shah, who will address the inaugural session of official language’s diamond jubilee celebrations and 4th Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan here on Friday, will also launch the diamond jubilee special issue of 'Rajbhasha Bharti' magazine, besides releasing a commemorative postage stamp and coin, said a home ministry release.He will present the 'Rajbhasha Gaurav' and 'Rajbhasha Kirti' awards on the occasion.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been constantly emphasising on the development of Hindi and Indian languages and better coordination between them, the MHA release said.The home minister had conceptualised organising Hindi Diwas on a large scale in various cities in 2019. Varanasi had hosted Hindi Diwas and the first Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan in 2021, followed by Surat in 2022 and Pune in 2023.During the two-day conference starting here on Saturday, an in-depth discussion will be held on the progress of Hindi as an official language, public language and contact language in the last 75 years. Additionally, there will be discussion on 'India's cultural heritage and Hindi' and a session on three newly launched criminal laws -- Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita 2023 and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023.","The ‘Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag’, in collaboration with Centre for Deployment of Advanced Computing ( C-DAC ), will put in place a universal translation system for official communication.

"Satellite-based toll system to have factory-fitted unit, phased launch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/satellite-based-toll-system-to-have-factory-fitted-unit-phased-launch/articleshow/113335203.cms,"Satellites will track distance

Using pre-installed device

And virtual toll booths

With dedicated lanes at first

That will start with trucks

The govt this week set the ball rolling for toll collection based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) coupled with on-board units (OBUs) installed in vehicles. The new system, once fully operational across highways , will ensure nonstop travel and remove the need for physical toll plazas or toll gates. The full rollout will need a couple of years, but the system promises a better experience during highway travel.Here's how it will work:The key highlight of the new toll system is that a satellite or constellation of satellites will track the movement of vehicles and calculate the toll or user fee based on the exact distance travelled. That means vehicles will no longer have to stop at barriers for the electronic deduction of toll. The road transport and highways ministry amended the NH Fee Rules to allow toll collection using the GNSS-OBU system earlier this week. Officials said the toll system will use NavIC, India's satellite-based navigation system.Each vehicle will need to be fitted with a non-transferable GNSS-OBU unit. This unit, which works as a tracking device, can either be installed externally (retrofitted) or come installed from the factory. This unit will communicate digitally with a 'centralised/zonal toll charger' software that will be installed along designated highway stretches. This 'toll charger' will receive inputs regarding distance and time travelled from the OBU fitted in vehicles. These OBUs will be onboarded with the 'toll charger' by fintech companies, which will serve as the ""issuer entity"", just like there are issuer banks under the FASTag system.The installation of OBUs will be checked at the time of registration, re-registration and fitness test.Tracking of the entry and exit of vehicles will be done using virtual gantries (a kind of signal infrastructure) that are to be installed along the tolled highway network. These will communicate with GNSS-enabled vehicles. These gantries will thus serve as a virtual toll booth that will gather information such as vehicle registration number, type, and bank account details. When the GNSS-OBU vehicle passes through this virtual toll booth, the system will automatically deduct the user fee from the user's account using the existing FASTag ecosystem for payment.User fee will be calculated real-time whenever a vehicle crosses the designated length of toll plazas, makes a U-turn, and leaves the GNSS stretch. The user will get an SMS of the toll deducted on every occasion. The 'toll charger' will calculate the user fee based on toll parameters defined by NHAI such as type of structure, that is, bypass, expressway, or flyover, etc.To begin with, the existing toll plazas will have dedicated 'GNSS lanes' where the barrier gates will normally stay open to allow uninterrupted passage of vehicles fitted with GNSS-OBUs. These lanes will have the advanced readers to track such vehicles while allowing them to zip through without stopping. Subsequently, more lanes will be brought under this system.NHAI will bring out the bid document in the next two months and the target is to make the first stretch under commercial satellite-based tolling operational by April-June 2025.Indian and global technology majors, including TCS, Infosys, Accenture, RailTel, TCIL, Sky Toll, Kapsch, BEMobile and Movyon, have expressed interest and submitted applications to develop the system for GNSS-based tolling.GNSS-based tolling will start with trucks, buses and vehicles carrying dangerous goods since these already feature the Vehicle Location Tracking (VLT) system and don't involve privacy issues. Other commercial vehicles will be the next segment to be onboarded. Private vehicles will be brought under GNSS tracking as part of the last stage in 2026-27.The highway-owning agencies of Central govt have completed the geo-fencing of almost the entire length of national highways. Geo-fencing is crucial for marking the exact entry and exit points for toll calculation. The GNSS tolling agency will do geo-referencing of highways before commencing GNSS-based tolling. The total length of national highways in India is around 1.4 lakh km with user fee being collected on approximately 45,000km.Initially, GNSS-based tolling will be rolled out on 2,000km of national highways by June 2025. It will be extended to 10,000km in nine months, 25,000km in 15 months, and 50,000km in two years.","The new system will ensure nonstop travel and remove the need for physical toll plazas or toll gates. The full rollout will need a couple of years, but the system promises a better experience during highway travel.

The perception stuck and came back to haunt the premier investigating agency when Justice Ujjal Bhuyan used the expression to question the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal It was the then CJI, R M Lodha, who coined the term while hearing the coal scam case during UPA govt and pulled up the agency for working under the Centre's influence.Questioning CBI's motive and timing in arresting Kejriwal immediately after he was granted bail in the ED case, Justice Bhuyan said, ""When CBI did not feel the necessity to arrest the appellant for 22 long months, I fail to understand the great hurry and urgency on its part to arrest the appellant when he was on the cusp of release in the ED case.""He further said, ""CBI is the premier investigating agency of the country. It is in public interest that CBI must not only be above board but must also be seen to be so. Rule of law, which is a basic feature of our constitutional republic, mandates that investigation must be fair, transparent and judicious. This court has time and again emphasised that fair investigation is a fundamental right of an accused person under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution. Investigation must not only be fair but must be seen to be so. Every effort must be made to remove any perception that investigation was not carried out fairly and that the arrest was made in a high-handed and biased manner.""Justice Bhuyan added, ""In a functional democracy governed by the rule of law, perception matters. Like Caesar's wife, an investigating agency must be above board. Not so long ago, this court had castigated CBI, comparing it to a caged parrot. It is imperative that CBI dispel the notion of it being a caged parrot. Rather, the perception should be that of an uncaged parrot."" He also emphasised that power to arrest should be used by probe agencies sparingly and an accused could not be arrested for being evasive in his response to a query.""The respondent is definitely wrong when it says that because the appellant was evasive in his reply, because he was not cooperating with the probe, therefore, he was rightly arrested and now should be continued in detention. It cannot be the proposition that only when an accused answers the questions put to him by the investigation agency in the manner in which the investigating agency would like the accused to answer, would mean that the accused is cooperating with the investigation. Further, the respondent can't justify arrest and continued detention citing evasive reply,"" Justice Bhuyan said.The judge said an accused has the right to remain silent and he cannot be compelled to make inculpatory statements against himself. ""This court, while emphasising the need to sensitise police against high-handed arrest, deprecated the attitude to arrest first and then to proceed with the rest...While emphasising that police officers should not arrest the accused unnecessarily and that the magistrate should not authorise detention casually and mechanically... The exercise of the power of arrest must be pursued sparingly. This court reiterated the role of the courts in protecting personal liberty and ensuring that investigations are not used as a tool of harassment,"" he added.","Justice Ujjal Bhuyan used the expression to question the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.

While granting him bail in the ED case, the apex court had barred Kejriwal from going to the Delhi secretariat but allowed him to send those files to the LG which require the latter's approval.""Arvind Kejriwal is the chief minister of Delhi, who heads the council of ministers and oversees governance via ministers of various departments. He is fully empowered to give directions to all his ministers so that work can be done in public interest,"" AAP said in a statement. ""The only files that are signed by the chief minister are those that have to be sent to the LG for which he has permission from Supreme Court. Therefore, no work of the people of Delhi will stop,"" it added.Several important policy decisions, including the flagship Mahila Samman Nidhi Yojana - a scheme to provide financial assistance of Rs 1,000 to all women aged above 18 - which was announced in the Delhi budget this year; dearness allowance for daily wagers; Delhi Start-Up Policy; Dilli Bazaar Portal; Cloud Kitchen Policy; Food Truck Policy; City's Logistics Plan; Delhi Electronic System Design, Manufacturing, and Refurbishment (ESDMR) Policy 2022-27; and Industrial and Economic Development Policy 2023-33 are ready and need approval of the cabinet which is headed by the CM.The appointment of a new minister against a vacant position in the cabinet and the appointment of a presiding officer for the mayoral polls are also awaiting Kejriwal's nod. Rolling out these schemes and policies are crucial for the AAP govt in view of the assembly elections in Delhi. He also needs to take a decision on calling a session of Delhi Assembly as the last session was held in April this year. Transfer and posting of Group 'A' officers, along with a decision on disciplinary action, will also have to be set in motion by calling a meeting of National Capital Civil Services Authority (NCCSA), which is chaired by him.AAP MLA and lawyer Somnath Bharti said the court has allowed the CM to sign all those files that require the approval of the LG.

The 22-year-old was accompanied by three other young men from Karnataka - all deceived by a fraudulent agent and slyly drafted into a private Russian army to fight Ukraine.According to them, at least 60 Indian youth fell prey to this job fraud , with many among them still languishing in foreign land. They were all shipped out of India in Dec 2023, with a promise to get them work either as security personnel or helpers in Russia.But life took a turn for the worse once they landed in Russia. ""We were treated like slaves,"" Narayanpet's Sufiyan told TOI soon after landing in Hyderabad a little past noon on Friday.The young man recalled his harrowing past few months. ""We were woken up at 6 am every day and made to work 15 hours straight - with no rest or sleep. The conditions were inhuman. We were given meagre ration. Our hands were blistered, our backs ached and our spirits were broken. Yet, if we showed any signs of exhaustion, bullets were fired at us to force us back into the laborious tasks,"" Sufiyan added, his voice trembling.Their assignments were no mean jobs. They had to dig trenches and fire assault rifles. They were also trained to fire Kalashnikovs such as the AK-12 and AK-74, along with hand grenades and other explosives.But the toughest challenge was to stay disconnected from the rest of the world. Sufiyan and his companions recalled how they never knew with certainty where they were - or were being taken to - and were not allowed to communicate with their families back in India.""Our mobile phones were seized. For months during the training, I could not talk to my family,"" said Abdul Nayeem from Karnataka, fighting back tears.The psychological toll of living in an alien war zone was immense on the men. Syed Ilias Hussaini, a resident of Kalaburagi in Karnataka, described the constant fear of being caught in the crossfire and the unrelenting pressure to perform under life-threatening circumstances. ""Every day we woke up not knowing if it would be our last. The sound of gunfire and explosions became a constant backdrop to our lives, and we lived in perpetual fear,"" Ilias said, his eyes welling up.The only way to cope, the men said, was to pray and imagine a day when they would set foot back in India and reunite with their families. ""We longed for the comfort of our families and the safety of our homes. The thought of never seeing them again haunted us every day,"" Sufiyan said, tightly holding onto his brother Mohammad Salman who, along with his father, mother and others, were at the airport to receive him.The sight of other ""soldiers"" dropping dead only added to their trauma. ""Hamil, a very good friend of mine from Gujarat, was blown to death in a drone attack. He was part of a team of 24 soldiers, including one Indian and one Nepali. It shook me up,"" recalled Sufiyan. He added: ""It was only after Hamil's death that we told our families about our situation, who then requested Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar to rescue us from the warzone. I am glad to be able to see this day.""","Mohammad Sufiyan, 22, returned home to Hyderabad on Friday. Video of him pleading to be rescued from the war-hit Russia-Ukraine border surfaced.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday approved health coverage to all senior citizens aged 70 years and above irrespective of income under the flagship scheme Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), regardless of their socio-economic status.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw while announcing the Cabinet's decision while addressing the media said that this will benefit approximately 4.5 Crore families with six (6) crore senior citizens with 5 Lakh rupees free health insurance cover on a family basis.The eligible senior citizens, under this initiative, will receive a new distinct card that entitles them to the benefits of the scheme.Additionally, for those who are already covered under AB PM-JAY, an additional top-up cover of up to ₹5 lakh per year will be provided exclusively for the senior citizen, without the need to share it with other family members below the age of 70.Meanwhile, senior citizens aged 70 and above who are already benefiting from other public health insurance schemes, such as CGHS, ECHS, or Ayushman CAPF , have the option to either continue with their existing scheme or switch to AB PM-JAY.Senior citizens in this age group who are covered under private health insurance policies or the Employees' State Insurance scheme are still eligible for benefits under AB PM-JAY.Prime Minister Narendra Modi following the announcement, in a post on X, said that the government is committed to ensure accessible, affordable and top quality healthcare for every Indian.""In this context, the Cabinet today has decided to further expand the ambit of Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY to provide health coverage for all citizens above 70 years. This scheme will ensure dignity, care and security to 6 crore citizens!,"" said PM Modi.The expansion of coverage to senior citizens aged 70 and above was initially announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April 2024.AB PM-JAY, the world's largest publicly funded health assurance scheme, provides a health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to 55 crore individuals, corresponding to 12.34 crore families. The scheme covers all family members, irrespective of age, and has already covered 7.37 crore hospital admissions, with 49 percent of the beneficiaries being women. The public has benefited to the extent of over Rs 1 Lakh crore under the scheme.The Cabinet also approved Rs 12,461 crore outlay to support the development of 31,350 MW hydropower projects that will be implemented over an eight-year period from FY2024-25 to FY2031-32. As per the official statement, the budgetary support for the cost of enabling infrastructure has been rationalized based on the project capacity.For projects up to 200 MW, the limit of budgetary support is set at Rs one crore/MW. For projects above 200 MW, the limit is set at Rs 200 crore plus Rs 0.75 crore per MW exceeding 200 MW.The Cabinet also approved the PM E-Drive Scheme, which has been allocated a budget of Rs 10,900 crore for a period of two years to promote the adoption of electric vehicles in India and will replace the FAME programme, which had been in operation for nine years until March.The government under the scheme will provide support to 24.79 lakh electric two-wheelers, 3.16 lakh e-three wheelers, and 14,028 e-buses.

"IAF wants Tejas jet production to be ramped up, even as supply of delayed US engines to begin from Nov",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-wants-tejas-jet-production-to-be-ramped-up-even-as-supply-of-delayed-us-engines-to-begin-from-nov/articleshow/113301206.cms,"NEW DELHI: Grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle China and Pakistan, the IAF has called for majorly ramping up the production rate of indigenous Tejas fighter jets , even using the public-private partnership route.The good news is that US company General Electric is now likely to begin from Nov onwards the much-delayed supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines, which power Tejas Mark-1A fighters, after defence minister Rajnath Singh flagged the matter during his visit to Washington last month.IAF wants to induct around 300 Tejas fighters over the next 15 years, which will require defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ) to step-up its production rate in a major way.“The issue is matching production capacity with our requirements. The way forward is to diversify production lines, have more public private partnerships or joint ventures with private partners to have multiple weaponry lines as well as multiple production lines,” IAF chief Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari said, on the sidelines of the multi-nation Tarang Shakti exercise in Jodhpur.On the supply of aero-engines, HAL is slated to get delivery of at least two GE-F404 engines per month from Nov onwards, as per the fresh commitment given by General Electric, officials told TOI.“The assurance is there. But whether the delivery of the aero-engines actually begins in Nov remains to be seen,” an official said. The delay in the delivery timeframe of 99 GE-F404 aero-engines, which were to begin in March, is one of the major problems that has hit the production schedule of the first 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets, which were contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal inked in Feb 2021, as was reported by TOI earlier.All these 83 “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jets were to be delivered to IAF in the February 2024-February 2028 timeframe. “Under the contract, the first jet was to be delivered by Feb-March this year, but it will probably come only by Nov now. At best, HAL will be able to deliver only eight of 16 jets that were to be delivered in the 2024-25 fiscal. All this will have a cascading effect down the line,” the official said.Another Rs 67,000 crore contract for 97 more Tejas Mark-1A fighters is also now being finalized, with the defence ministry issuing the tender to HAL earlier this year.India and the US, of course, are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and HAL for the Tejas Mark-2 fighters in India, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.The cabinet committee on security in August 2022 had cleared the over Rs 9,000 crore development of the Tejas Mark-2 fighters with the more powerful GE-F414 engines. IAF plans to induct six squadrons (108 jets) of Tejas Mark-2, which will have a longer combat range and greater weapon-carrying capacity than the Mark-1A variant.Under the long developmental saga of the Tejas, IAF till now has only got 35-36 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters that were ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in March 2006 and Dec 2010.","IAF wants to induct around 300 Tejas fighters over the next 15 years.

Will be able to start or stop rain in 5 years: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-develop-mausam-gpt-in-5-years-to-share-weather-info/articleshow/113306697.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian weather scientists hope to have enough expertise in the next five years to not only enhance rain but also suppress it, along with hail and lightning, in certain areas at will. This means, if Delhi or any other city wants to suppress rains during, say, Independence Day celebrations, scientists would be able to do it through interventions.Similarly, rain/hail can be suppressed in cities during floods.“We want to go for initial experimental artificial rain suppression and enhancement. Lab simulations (cloud chambers) will be done in the next 18 months, but we’ll definitely go for artificial weather modification in the five-year time scale,” said M Ravichandran, secretary, earth sciences ministry (MoES), on Thursday elaborating on Mission Mausam which got the Cabinet’s nod a day earlier.On whether rains could be suppressed on August 15, Ravichandran said: “We can think of it (through weather modification)”. Under the Mission Mausam mandate, scientists will also work on incremental improvement of weather forecast systems in the country in terms of further raising short- and medium-range forecast accuracy by 5-10%.Under the Mission, which aims to make India climate smart and weather-ready by not letting any weather phenomena, including even cloud burst, remain undetected, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) along with other scientific institutions of the MoES will also develop and launch ‘ Mausam GPT ’, a chatGPT like application, that will help users to get quick weather related information in both written and audio form in the next five years.Suppression and enhancement of rain techniques are already being used through cloud seeding, using aircraft, in a limited way in the US, Canada, China, Russia and Australia among others. There have beencloud seeding projects, called overseeding, aimed at reducing hail in order to prevent damage to fruit orchards and grain fields in a couple of these countries.“Cloud seeding and cloud modification is a complex process. We have done a lot of experiments with cloud seeding to enhance rain with limited success. But not much has been done on cloud suppression,” Madhavan Rajeevan, former MoES secretary, told TOI.He said though there is a scope in India for weather modification, its science is not well understood and technology is complex. “In my opinion, we should start doing research in weather modification and we need investments,” said Rajeevan.The government has initially approved Rs 2,000 crore over two years for the Mission Mausam to create a more ro bust forecasting system for dealing with the impacts of extreme weather events and climate change . Later, more funds will be earmarked for it.Critical elements of the mission include the deployment of next-generation radars and satellite systems with advanced sensors and high-performance supercomputers, the development of improved earth system models and a GIS-based automated Decision Support System for real-time data dissemination.India is already experimenting with artificial rain making techniques, involving cloud seeding using aircraft, and have done some pilot projects in Maharashtra and elsewhere. It is being done to study cloud microphysical characteristics through a research programme, called Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX).","Indian weather scientists hope to have enough expertise in the next five years to enhance rain and suppress it, along with hail and lightning, in certain areas at will.

Moin Khan opens up on India refraining to visit Pakistan for Champions trophy | Cricket Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Moin Khan has raised concerns about India's hesitation to travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025. He urged the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) to adopt a firm stance if India continue to refuse, reflecting the wider frustration within the cricket community over the lack of bilateral matches between the two countries.Speaking on Cricket Pakistan, Khan highlighted the importance of Indian cricket legends intervening to convince the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) to separate sports from politics.He stated, ""Former India cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Kapil Dev, Rahul Dravid, etc., should tell their cricket board to keep politics away from cricket. Cricket should not be obstructed by political issues. The fans would love to see India and Pakistan play. It will not only benefit Pakistan, but overall cricket will be benefited.""Khan also questioned the role of the International Cricket Council (ICC) if India do not participate and called on the global cricket body to ensure India honour their commitments.He added, ""India ought to honour their commitments with the ICC. And if they do not come, then Pakistan should reconsider their decision to participate in any future events slated to be held in India.""The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is set to take place in Pakistan, but India’s participation remains uncertain due to ongoing political tensions. India have not toured Pakistan since 2006, and diplomatic relations show no signs of improvement, making an Indian tour to Pakistan highly unlikely.","The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is set to take place in Pakistan, but India’s participation remains uncertain due to ongoing political tensions.

The Union Cabinet recently announced several key initiatives aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility, boosting renewable energy, and promoting electric mobility across India. Among these, the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) now offers comprehensive health coverage to all senior citizens aged 70 years and above, regardless of income or socio-economic status.In addition, the government approved substantial outlays for hydropower projects and introduced the PM E-Drive Scheme to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, replacing the FAME programme.Here's all you need to know about the new insurance coverage under Ayushman BharatThe union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , has given the green light to the new initiative designed to offer extensive health coverage to senior citizens aged 70 and above.

Under this program, each family will receive free health insurance coverage of up to 5 Lakh rupees.The AB PM-JAY extends financial protection to approximately 55 crore people, equivalent to 12.34 crore households, by providing a health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. Since its inception, it has facilitated 7.37 Crore hospital admissions, with women constituting 49 percent of the beneficiaries. The cumulative financial benefit availed by the public under this scheme has surpassed Rs. 1 Lakh crore.The key advantage of this top-up is that it is exclusively available to the senior citizen and does not need to be shared with other family members below the age of 70.

Retirement age raised

'An inevitable choice'

NEW DELHI: In a major indication that alarm bells are going off in Beijing due to an impending demographic crisis that could potentially have severe impact on its economy , healthcare and social welfare systems, China's top legislative body on Friday announced plans to raise the country's retirement age .The development also comes as reports have highlighted that over 22,000 kindergartens have been closed across China in the past two years due to plummeting birth rates, with some turning into nursing homes to tend to the elderly.A slowing economy, shrinking government benefits and a decades-long one-child policy have created a creeping demographic crisis in China. China's pension pot is also running dry and the country is running out of time to build enough of a fund to care for the growing number of elderly.Over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce . This is the country's largest age group, nearly equivalent to the size of the US population.Significantly, the national population fell in 2023 for the second year in a row.Reform is urgent with life expectancy in China having risen to 78 years as of 2021 from about 44 years in 1960 and projected to exceed 80 years by 2050.The number of people aged 60 and older is projected to rise dramatically, with estimates suggesting that this demographic will account for about 30% of the population by 2035, up from 14.2% in 2021.At the same time, the working population needed to support the elderly is shrinking.The decision to raise the retirement age, marks the first such adjustment since the 1970s and accelerates an overhaul of decades-old laws to tackle the economic pressure of a shrinking workforce.China's retirement ages are currently among the lowest globally.The retirement age will be raised for men to 63 years old from 60, while for women in white collar work it would be raised to 58 years from 55. For women in blue collar work it will be adjusted to 55 from 50.The changes will come into effect from January 1, 2025 and will be implemented over the next 15 years with incremental adjustments occurring every few months.""Starting 2030, the minimum year of basic pension contributions required to receive monthly benefits will also be gradually raised from 15 years to 20 years at the pace of an increase of six months annually,"" said news agency Xinhua. By 2039, they would have to clock 20 years of contributions to access their pensions.The new rules will also allow Chinese people ""to postpone retirement to an even later date if they reach an agreement with employers"".Retiring before the statutory age will not be allowed, state news agency Xinhua reported, although people can extend their retirement by no more than three years.The demographic crisis poses severe risks to China's economy, particularly regarding the pension system. A report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences projected that the state pension fund could be depleted by 2035 if no reforms are enacted. The increasing number of retirees, coupled with a declining birth rate, places immense pressure on the pension system, which relies on a robust workforce to support an expanding elderly population.By extending the retirement age, the government aims to alleviate some of this pressure. Delaying retirement can help stabilise the labour force participation rate and reduce the financial burden on the pension system. Moreover, it allows for a larger tax base to support social welfare programs, which is crucial as the population ages.But delaying pension payouts and requiring older workers to stay at their jobs longer may not be welcomed by all.""In the next 10 years, there will be another bill that will delay retirement until we are 80,"" one user wrote on a Chinese social media site Weibo.Further, many younger workers fear that an expanded labour pool will intensify competition for jobs, particularly as youth unemployment rates have soared to alarming levels. In July 2024, the jobless rate for those aged 16 to 24 reached 17.1%, raising concerns about the economic prospects for younger generations""What a miserable year! Middle-aged workers are faced with pay cuts and raised retirement ages. Those who are unemployed find it increasingly difficult to get jobs,"" another chimed in.However, Mo Rong, director of the Chinese Academy of Labour and Social Security, told the People's Daily that raising the retirement age was ""an inevitable choice for our country to adapt to the new normal of population development"".","China's top legislative body on Friday announced plans to raise the country's retirement age.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
