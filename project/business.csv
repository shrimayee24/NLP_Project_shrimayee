NEW DELHI: Indian carriers have been compelled to cancel or reroute several flights to ensure operational safety, Union minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on Tuesday, in the wake of the Middle East crisis.Naidu also said that the ministry of civil aviation is continuously monitoring the situation and coordinating with airlines to give the real time update.""Given recent geopolitical developments and the closure of airspace over countries, Indian carriers have been compelled to cancel or reroute several flights to ensure operational safety. The Ministry of Civil Aviation is continuously monitoring the situation and coordinating with airlines to provide real-time updates.

According to a report of Reuters, it also added that the US base was far from urban facilities and residential areas in Qatar. It also asserted that the action doesn't pose any threat to ""our friendly and brotherly"" neighbour Qatar.","Indian carriers have been compelled to cancel or reroute several flights to ensure operational safety, Union minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on Tuesday.

New Delhi : Disregarding Congress brass’s frowns, its MP Shashi Tharoor has said PM Narendra Modi ’s energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a “prime asset” for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.“The diplomatic outreach following Operation Sindoor was a moment of national resolve and effective communication. It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms,” Tharoor wrote in an article published in The Hindu.“While the immediate military action was decisive, the subsequent diplomatic outreach was equally, if not more, vital in shaping global perceptions and consolidating international support,” the Thiruvananthapuram MP said in the article that was referred to by PMO on its X handle.Tharoor had earlier raised his party leadership’s hackles by praising Operation Sindoor and by agreeing to head one of the parliamentary delegations to sensitise global opinion to the necessity of India’s military retaliation following the Pahalgam terror attack . His party had questioned govt picking members of the delegation.His fresh praise for the PM can only widen the MP’s gulf with the party brass. It also coincides with a fresh flurry of Congress attacks on Modi, this time for not “unequivocally condemning” the US for bombing Iran.Some in the party said Tharoor, unlike many of his colleagues, did not repost on X an article by Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Gaza and Iran.In contrast, BJP highlighted Tharoor’s praise for the PM. Reflecting on his experience of leading the delegation that visited the US and other countries, Tharoor said the very composition of the delegations, featuring MPs from diverse political parties, different states and varied faiths, was a potent message in itself.“It underscored that when it comes to national security and confronting terrorism, India speaks with one voice. This transcended domestic political differences, imbuing our message with greater credibility and gravitas in the eyes of our international interlocutors,” he said.","Shashi Tharoor said PM Narendra Modi’s energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a ‘prime asset’ for India on the global stage. “The diplomatic outreach following Operation Sindoor was a moment of national resolve and effective communication,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122037074,imgsize-669861,width-400,resizemode-4/122037074.jpg"

Israel-Iran conflict: Air India halts all flights to Middle East; Europe and US east coast also affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-conflict-air-india-halts-all-flights-to-middle-east-europe-and-us-east-coast-also-affected/articleshow/122032920.cms,"NEW DELHI: The closure of UAE and Qatar airspace late Monday night as missiles were fired from Iran towards US bases in Qatar and Iraq threw commercial air traffic completely out of gear. Hundreds of lights to and from the region — that houses mega hubs like Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi along with multiple smaller ones like Sharjah — were impacted.Flights headed there from across the world, including multiple Indian cities, were diverted, returned to origin or were put on hold. Flights headed from Lucknow to Dammam; Mumbai to Kuwait and Amritsar to Dubai were among those that turned back to the origin from over the Arabian Sea. And aircraft supposed to take off from there, remained on the ground.Early on Tuesday morning, Air India said it has ceased “all operations to Middle East as well as to and from the East Coast of North America and Europe with immediate effect, until further notice. Our India-bound flights from North America are diverting back to their respective origins and others are being diverted back to India or re-routed away from the closed airspaces.”AI says this due to “the developing situation in the Middle East. ”“We request the understanding of all passengers who may be affected by this disruption that’s beyond an airline’s control. Air India is in continuous consultation with its external security advisors and is vigilantly monitoring the evolving situation. We will keep our passengers informed of any updates. The safety and security of our passengers and staff remain our number one priority,” said an Air India spokesperson.The India market is served by biggies including Emirates Group, IndiGo, Air India Group, Qatar Airways, Etihad and multiple smaller airlines like Akasa, SpiceJet and Air Arabia. Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi are key transit points for travel between India and rest of the world. Dozens of flights to and from India alone were impacted on Monday night itself.In a statement, IndiGo said: “In view of the evolving situation in the Middle East, some of our flights may experience delays or diversions. These adjustments are being made to ensure operations remain within safe and compliant airspace. We recommend checking your flight status regularly. If your flight is impacted, alternate options can be easily explored through our website. We continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with the relevant authorities. We appreciate your patience and understanding.”An AI Express spokesperson said: “As a result of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and suspension of Qatar airspace, Air India Express has diverted our Doha bound flight from Kochi to Muscat and returned our flight bound from Kannur. Air India Express has no aircraft on the ground in Qatar. We are monitoring the situation closely and will take all necessary precautions for the safety and security of our guests and crew, with inputs from the relevant authorities… regret inconvenience. ”The airspace closure in the region started around 9 pm (IST) when Qatar closed its airspace for commercial airliners “to ensure safety of citizens, residents, and visitors.” As a result, a large number of flights headed to Doha — including many from Indian cities — were impacted. The enroute ones diverted to other nearby places like Abu Dhabi or Bahrain; some returned to their origin cities in India; boarding for those about to depart was put on hold and others were suspended till the airspace restrictions remain in force.The point-to-point trafic between India and Doha is rather low, with the majority being one-stop transit flyers. IndiGo, the biggest Indian operator to Doha, saw the maximum impact. Its enroute flights to Doha from Delhi and Hyderabad were diverted to Bahrain and one from Kochi went to Abu Dhabi. Comments were sought from Qatar Airways and awaited till the time of going to press.Air India’s three flights were immediately impacted: one was diverted to Abu Dhabi, other returned to India and the third was put on hold. AI Express put boarding of its Doha-bound flights on hold at Indiana airports. AI Express has flights between Doha and six Indian cities — Kannur, Kochi, Kozhikode, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchchirappalli. Multiple flights headed from the west to Doha diverted to nearby cities including Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.Within an hour, the UAE airspace was also closed. That threw flights completely ot of gear. “At this point, there’s utter chaos and we can’t even guestimate the impact,” said senior official of multiple airlines.","The closure of UAE and Qatar airspace late Monday night as missiles were fired from Iran towards US bases in Qatar and Iraq threw commercial air traffic completely out of gear.

Bilawal Bhutto Zardari threatens India over Indus Waters Treaty suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bilawal-bhutto-zardari-threatens-india-over-indus-waters-treaty-suspension/articleshow/122033312.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning on Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.Speaking during the budget session of the National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers.” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the April 23 terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.The remarks came nearly two months after India suspended the IWT. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan-based militants for the assault, triggering fresh tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said.He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict. “We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon,” he said. “Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he claimed.Bilawal also urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will only increase in both countries,” he warned, adding that Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.The former FM also accused India of misusing global platforms to target Pakistan. “When we got off the FATF grey list, India tried hard to reverse it through lobbying and misinformation. But our diplomacy prevailed,” he claimed.He questioned the logic of what he called “PM Modi’s new abnormal”, where any terror incident is met with immediate threats against Pakistan. “We suffer terrorist attacks far more frequently than India — many traced to Indian funding or involvement. Should we adopt the same policy of automatic retaliation? That would mean surrendering our future to the agenda of terrorists,” he said.Bilawal insisted that peace in South Asia was not possible without dialogue and mutual trust. “We are not only fighting for Pakistan’s future, we are fighting for regional stability, for the people of both countries,” he said.The IWT, one of the few surviving agreements between India and Pakistan, allocates water from six rivers in the Indus basin. Under the treaty, India has control over the eastern rivers – Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers – Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.

The byelection, held on Thursday, saw a voter turnout of 69.85% by 5pm and was largely peaceful, aside from a few isolated incidents.Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed gratitude saying, ""People of all religions, castes, races and walks of life in the area have blessed us immensely by exercising their right to vote in the by-elections to the Kaliganj Assembly constituency. I humbly express my gratitude to them. The main architects of this victory are mother, soil, and people. My colleagues from Kaliganj have worked tirelessly for this. I also extend my heartfelt congratulations to them. """"My greetings and salutations to everyone. In memory of the late MLA Nasiruddin Ahmed, I dedicate this victory to the motherland and people of Bengal,"" she said.Alifa, a 38-year-old engineer, left her corporate role at a Kolkata-based IT company to enter politics, drawing inspiration from Mahua Moitra, the Trinamool MP from Krishnanagar—under which the Kaliganj Assembly segment falls. Like Moitra, who traded her career in investment banking for the political arena, Alifa chose grassroots engagement and legislative advocacy over her former profession.Meanwhile, a blast in Kaliganj in Naida district killed a 13-year-old girl prompting CM Mamata to take strict action against the culprits.","All India Trinamool Congress candidate Alifa Ahmed secured a sweeping victory in the Kaliganj Assembly bypoll.

House in Mumbai: Richest 5% need 109 years' savings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-in-mumbai-richest-5-need-109-years-savings/articleshow/122035515.cms,"This is an AI image

Even for the top 5% of urban families by income in Maharashtra, buying a house in Mumbai would take more than 100 years of saving to fund. In Haryana and Odisha, it would take over 50 years of saving by the richest 5% to buy a house in their biggest cities. Chandigarh, by contrast, is the most affordable capital.These numbers have been arrived at by comparing the income of the top 5% households in a state/UT with average price of a 110sq m (1,184sq ft) house in its capital city - the middle of the three house size categories for which National Housing Board (NHB) compiles data. In 2022-23, India's gross savings to GDP ratio was 30.2%, and the same ratio has been applied to calculate savings of the richest 5% households.The income of the top 5% of urban families is derived from the average Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) of the top 5% of urban folks in a state. The rural MPCE is considerably lower.In Maharashtra, for instance, the urban MPCE for the top 5% is Rs 22,352 per person per month. For a family of four, the income would be Rs 89,408 per month or Rs 10.7 lakh per annum.Applying the 30.2% saving rate to Maharashtra's top 5% families, their annual savings would be around Rs 3.2 lakh.NHB's data on house prices shows that the per square foot price for a house with a carpet area between 645 sq feet and 1,184 sq feet was Rs 29,911 in March 2025.This means a 1,184 square feet house on average cost over Rs 3.5 crore in Mumbai. With a saving of Rs 3.2 lakh per annum, the top 5% urban families of Maharashtra would have to save for 109 years to afford this house.NHB's average carpet area price is based on the registration data collected from sub-registrar offices (SROs) as well as the valuation data collected from primary lending institutions.A similar calculation shows that for the top 5% urban families in Haryana, it would take 63 years to afford a house of similar size in Gurgaon. In Bhubaneswar, it would take more than 50 years of savings for Odisha's richest 5% urbanites to afford a house.Of the 21 state capitals for which carpet area price data was available from NHB, in 10 it would take more than 30 years of savings to buy a house. Chandigarh is the most affordable, as 15 years of savings will be enough to buy a 1,184 square feet house. Jaipur is the only other city where less than 20 years of savings would suffice.","The top 5% of urban families by income in Maharashtra would have to save 109 years to afford a 1,184 sq ft house. In Haryana and Odisha, it would take over 50 years of saving by the richest 5% to buy a house in their biggest cities. Chandigarh, by contrast, is the most affordable capital.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122035629,imgsize-318185,width-400,resizemode-4/122035629.jpg"

Epilogue: From Fallout to Future



There’s a running meme on X, the hellhole formerly known as Twitter, where a doctor asks a patient: “Do you have a history of mental illness in your family?” To this, the patient replies: “I have an uncle who believes Iran is close to a nuclear weapon for the last 50 years. ”Perhaps that’s why Operation Midnight Hammer – a blow-by-blow remake of– was carried out with such haste that even half of Donald Trump’s base were still railing against it as the bombs dropped on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan.While Iran’s Godot-like wait for nuclear weapons continues, it’s illustrative to see how India, a nation that didn’t evoke very warm feelings from Uncle Sam in the past, became a nuclear superpower. How did a newly freed, partition-bruised, socialist-leaning, and largely illiterate country go from famine queues and imported milk powder to becoming one of the world’s most improbable nuclear powers?The truth is that politicians of various vintages played a part, irrespective of their worldview or political leanings. Every one of them was of the opinion that the Ayatollahs of Potomac (a delightful term coined by TOI legend K Subrahmanyam, the father of the current external affairs minister) couldn’t be the only ones with the power of the sun in the palm of their hands.As George Fernandes, the erstwhile Defence Minister of India in the Vajpayee government, summed up this grit: “I am not a former socialist; I am a socialist. I am not a former pacifist; I am a pacifist. I am even today an anti-nuclear weapon man. But as a defence minister of the country, I will do whatever is best to protect its border, and if that means nuclear bomb, then why not?”When pressed on how one could do so at the risk of contradicting oneself, Fernandes dug deep into the Lord Krishna rationale that one’s dharma trumps all contradictions, pointing out: “Yes, even at the cost of contradicting oneself, even at the cost of dying.If the security of the country requires me to die, I shall die. It’s about being realistic. It’s about being patriotic.”While with the benefit of hindsight, it might seem inevitable that the land that gave the world the Bhagavad Gita would come up with nuclear weapons, here’s the tale of how it went down.Let’s say you haven’t seen, skipped physics class, and think “fusion” is what happens when you have tandoori gravy momos.To understand nukes, we need to rewind to 1905, when a wild-haired Swiss patent clerk named Albert Einstein wrote four papers that changed science forever.One of them suggested that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. A few months later, he dropped a tiny but terrifying equation: E = mc². That means energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Since light travels really fast — about 300 million metres per second — squaring it makes even a small amount of mass release a huge amount of energy.So, how do we turn that into a weapon? That’s where nuclear physics steps in.Certain heavy atoms like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are naturally unstable. If you shoot a neutron at them, they split — releasing heat, radiation, and more neutrons. Those neutrons hit other atoms, which split too. It’s called a chain reaction — kind of like a viral WhatsApp message, but instead of arguments, you get a mushroom cloud.That’s how atomic bombs work. The ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki used two designs:Both use Einstein’s idea: a little mass disappears, and a huge burst of energy takes its place. There’s also the hydrogen bomb, which is even more terrifying, but beyond the scope of this piece.By the 1960s, nuclear weapons were the privilege of a select five—America, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China—enshrined as permanent members of the global atomic aristocracy, the kind that liked to invade Vietnam in their spare time and host disarmament conferences in their downtime.There is something about nukes and their miasma. Once you have them, you don’t want others to get them. You start doing everything in your power to stop anyone else from joining this super-exclusive club, because deterrence is always more comfortable when it’s a monopoly.And then in 1974, India came knocking—with Smiling Buddha, gatecrashing the party with a silent explosion in the Rajasthan desert. If Israel was the nuclear sphinx, India was the grinning intruder who didn’t wait for an invitation.How did a socialist, beggared and non-aligned country acquire nuclear weapons? It all started with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Fabian socialist who wasn’t beyond making a Faustian deal if it was for the nation’s betterment. While he publicly championed atomic energy for rural electrification, privately he laid the groundwork for a weapons programme.Enter Homi Jehangir Bhabha—part physicist, part institution-builder, all ambition, played with élan by Jim Sarbh in the heavily fictionalised Rocket Boys, whose cheekbones are capable of setting off a different sort of chemical reaction.A Cambridge-trained genius with a velvet accent, Bhabha envisioned a self-sufficient Indian nuclear complex. He set up the Atomic Energy Commission in 1948 and Trombay’s Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) soon after.His three-stage nuclear plan was audacious: heavy water reactors for plutonium, fast breeder reactors for more fissile material, and eventually, thorium-based systems.In 1955, India obtained the CIRUS reactor from Canada, with heavy water courtesy the United States—both under the Atoms for Peace programme. It was a masterclass in strategic procurement.Enter the dragon. In 1962, Chinese troops stormed Indian posts in Ladakh and Arunachal. The result wasn’t just military humiliation; it was psychological trauma. Nehru aged a decade overnight. And two years later, when China tested a nuclear bomb in Lop Nur, India realised it wasn’t just behind—it was vulnerable.And then came the prodigal daughter. Indira Gandhi had no qualms about the world or any delusions about power. By the early ’70s, the scientific community—led by Raja Ramanna, P.K. Iyengar, and M.R. Srinivasan—had weaponised the plutonium harvested from CIRUS.On May 18, 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test in Pokhran, Rajasthan. Codenamed Smiling Buddha, because what better name for a nuclear bomb than the progenitor of peace, the device yielded around 8 kilotons, billed as a “peaceful nuclear explosion”. Canada fumed and threw a Trudeau-level fit. The US imposed sanctions. But much like she did when Richard Nixon threatened her during the Bangladesh Liberation War, Indira Gandhi didn’t flinch.From 1974 to 1998, India lived in nuclear ambiguity. We had tested a bomb—but never declared a doctrine. This era, later dubbed ""recessed deterrence"", saw India perfect the art of silent readiness.Prime Ministers like Morarji Desai were openly anti-nuclear. Others, like Rajiv Gandhi, were more nuanced—calling for universal disarmament while funding missile programmes.In this period, India commissioned the Dhruva reactor for weapons-grade plutonium. Ballistic missiles like Prithvi and Agni were tested under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, overseen by Dr. Abdul Kalam.Still, New Delhi avoided another test. The 1985 NPT Review Conference slammed the door shut on India’s membership. But India refused to sign a treaty that said: “You can’t have nukes, but the P5 can.”By the 1990s, India was ready. And P.V. Narasimha Rao, India’s philosopher-king of pragmatism, knew it. In 1995, with the Clinton administration distracted by Yeltsin’s vodka diplomacy and Pakistani warlords, Rao greenlit preparations for Pokhran-II. Shafts were drilled. Scientists were mobilised. Dr. Kalam, Dr. R. Chidambaram, and their teams stood by.Then, American satellites picked up movement. The CIA raised alarms. A New York Times exposé spooked Washington. Clinton dialled Delhi. Rao, deadpan as ever, stonewalled. The tests were paused.But he didn’t stop the programme. Instead, he ensured everything stayed intact—ready for a more audacious successor.As legend has it, Rao whispered to Atal Bihari Vajpayee before leaving office: “Everything is ready. You just have to press the button.”Rao never took credit. But when the mushroom clouds rose in 1998, they bore his blueprint.On May 11 and 13, 1998, India conducted five nuclear tests. Codename: Operation Shakti.This time, it wasn’t a “peaceful” explosion. It was a declaration. Fission and fusion devices were tested. Thermonuclear capability was claimed (though some scientists later debated the yield).Prime Minister Vajpayee announced: “India is now a nuclear weapons state.” Sanctions came. Condemnations followed. India shrugged.The team that delivered this feat:Pakistan tested six devices in response. South Asia was officially a two-bomb region. But India’s message was clear: deterrence, not domination.Having proven its capabilities, India now wanted respect.In 2005, under Manmohan Singh , India signed the Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement with President George W. Bush. It was historic. For the first time, a non-NPT country gained access to civilian nuclear trade.The deal was backed by the US Congress, the IAEA, and the NSG. It marked India’s transformation from global pariah to trusted partner—without dismantling a single warhead.Critics cried foul. Proponents hailed it as a realpolitik victory. For India, it was simple: we earned the bomb. Now we wanted the fuel.The bomb was never the endgame. It was the insurance policy. A radioactive reminder that India wouldn’t be bullied into compliance or bribed into silence. The scientists were the magicians, the politicians their illusionists. But behind them stood a civilisation that never wanted conquest—only the right to decide its destiny. From Bhabha’s lab bench to Vajpayee’s launch pad, India’s nuclear odyssey was built on a foundation of paradoxes: peaceful atoms turned potent, idealism wrapped in pragmatism, and restraint forged through power.Today, India’s nuclear arsenal isn’t about posturing. It’s about posture—calm, calculated, credible. We built the bomb not to drop it, but to make sure no one else could.So the next time someone scoffs at Indian statecraft, remind them: we cracked open the atom, outfoxed the CIA, kept our doctrine unspoken, and still walked into the world’s nuclear club with our head held high. We didn’t explode to destroy. We exploded to exist. And that, in the final analysis, is how you detonate a dream.","How did a newly freed, partition-bruised, socialist-leaning, and largely illiterate country go from famine queues and imported milk powder to becoming one of the world’s most improbable nuclear powers?

"Mughal Road gets tunnel, Omar Abdullah says ‘major achievement of my govt’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mughal-road-gets-tunnel-omar-abdullah-says-major-achievement-of-my-govt/articleshow/122033386.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Union government’s approval on Monday of 19 major road and tunnel projects worth Rs 10,637 crore, including a key tunnel on the historical Mughal Road linking Shopian, in the Kashmir Valley, with Poonch in Jammu, has caused widespread excitement across Kashmir.The proposed Peer Ki Gali tunnel, which will turn the 84-km Mughal Road into an all-weather road providing a crucial alternative to the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, has excited political leaders across the board. “It is a major achievement of my government,” Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said.Construction of a modern road on the old Mughal Road began in the 1970s, during the government of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, but the project saw little progress. It was revived in 2003 under Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s government, and by 2009 traffic was allowed during the tenure of Omar Abdullah. Though the road is now operational, it remains open only during summer as heavy snowfall on the key stretches of Peer Ki Gali and Bafliaz forces its closure in winter.Over the past eight months the National Conference government has been pushing for the tunnel project on the Mughal Road.“We have been working hard on this and held several rounds of discussions with government of India, particularly the ministry of road transport and highways. Finally, these major projects have been sanctioned,” CM Omar Abdullah told TOI. “The tunnel on the Mughal Road is of crucial importance as it will provide year-round connectivity between Kashmir and Jammu. It holds both strategic and commercial value.”Omar said that ever since he first drove on the Mughal Road in 2009, his party and his government have been advocating for construction of a tunnel. “We’ve been pursuing this for years, and I am glad it has finally received approval,” he said.Among the sanctioned projects is also the Sadhana Tunnel, which will connect Kupwara with the border region of Karnah, at an estimated cost of Rs 3,330 crore. Omar said he will also pursue a tunnel project for Gurez Valley in north Kashmir and intends to raise the matter with the Union government.The Mughal Road also holds historical significance. It was used by Mughal emperors in the 16th century to enter Kashmir. Emperor Akbar took this route to conquer the region in 1586, and his son, Jahangir, is believed to have died near Rajouri while returning from Kashmir.In a separate statement issued in Srinagar, both LG Manoj Sinha and Omar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari for approving these major projects.National Conference was quick to take credit, stating that “under the leadership of J&K CM Omar Abdullah our government has successfully convinced government of India to take up key infrastructure projects like the Mughal Road tunnel and the tunnel to Tangdhar.”A senior NC politician said the projects were sanctioned because J&K’s elected government pursued them with the Union government.","The proposed Peer Ki Gali tunnel will turn the 84-km Mughal Road into an all- weather road providing a crucial alternative to the Srinagar-Jammu national highway. “It is a major achievement of my government,” Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said.

NEW DELHI: After a campaign for assured pension, there is only a small proportion of central govt employees who have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme , offering assured 50 per cent pension, with several seeking further clarifications to exercise the one-time option.As a result, govt has extended the June-end deadline by three months. Employees want to be absolutely sure about the terms of the agreement before deciding to switch to UPS.A concern for employees who joined national pension system from 2004 is the lack of clarity on death benefits. While an assurance was given last week, there are still a few issues that are to be resolved.Under the UPS, while an employee will contribute 10 per cent of his or her salary towards pension, a matching contribution will be made by the Centre, which was 14 per cent under NPS. Under the new scheme, apart from the 10 per cent pension payment, another 8.5 per cent contribution is to be made by the Centre which will not reflect in the balance of the subscriber’s account. While most employees understand the change, there are some who believe that the payout may be lower.Further, some of the all India service officers want to know about the difference in contribution between the Centre and states, which don’t have a scheme yet.An IAS, IPS or Indian Forest Service officer spends time in the state with some of them also opting for central deputation. While the rules are quite clear, some of the officers have raised doubts.Meanwhile, fund managers, who have been asked to conduct outreach programmes, are smelling a rat and allege that some private players are sowing doubts as they stand to lose out on the annuity business under UPS.Employees now have time to exercise the switching option up to the end of September. The option can be exercised by 23 lakh government employees.",Only a small proportion of central govt employees have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme.

NEW DELHI: The statistics ministry will conduct a household income survey in 2026 and it has set up a technical advisory group (TEG) for it under the chairmanship of former executive director at the IMF Surjit Bhalla.This is the first of its kind household income survey that the ministry will undertake to get a better picture of income distribution and welfare and aid in datadriven policy making.“The TEG will guide the national statistics office towards conducting an all-India income distribution survey, tentatively scheduled for 2026. The expert group will provide guidance with regard to finalisation of concepts and definitions, preparation of the survey method and instruments, sampling design and method of estimation, and incorporate best country practices as adopted across the world,” said an official statement.It said that the survey will also strive to assess the impact of adoption of technology on household income (wages). The TEG will also provide guidance for finalisation of the survey results and report, the statement added, “The household income survey is another important initiative of the ministry to generate vital information for deriving income distribution and welfare thereof,” said the statement.In the past, MoSPI made efforts for collecting information on household income along with the consumer expenditure surveys on experimental basis in the 9th round (May 1955 to Sept 1955) and 14th round (July 1958 to June 1959) though no information was released.Later, it undertook collection of data on receipts and disbursements as part of Integrated Household Survey (IHS) in its 19th round (July 1964 to June 1965) and 24th round (July 1969 to June 1970) with the aim of obtaining a complete picture of transactions of household income.The statement said that however these efforts were not continued as it was found that the estimates of income were lower than the estimates of consumption and savings put together.In 1983-84, the NSS again attempted a pilot inquiry on household income to explore the possibility of evolving an operationally feasible collection of data on household income. This too could not transform to an all India survey.“Experience from these surveys showed there were difficulties in collecting reliable income data in the field and to overcome all these issues and having more clarity in the surveys procedures and to oversee the overall activities of the Household Income Survey and in view of the experiences of survey conducted by countries like Australia, US, Canada and South Africa. MoSPI has constituted a technical expert group (TEG). ..,” the statement added.The national sample survey (NSS) has taken a number of initiatives to plug gaps in data in different spheres of social and economic interests. It has started annual surveys on unincorporated sector enterprises, services sectors, forward looking surveys on private sector capital expenditure, etc. with a view to make available data on important macroeconomic indicators, it added.",The statistics ministry will conduct a household income survey in 2026.

The flooded rivers, rivulets, and nullahs of Abujmarh significantly hinder anti-Maoist operations by restricting movement, disrupting logistics, and reducing visibility - factors that provide the Maoists, many of whom are local tribals, a tactical edge.Key rivers like Indravati, Parlakota, Pamulgautam, Godavari, and Pranhita near the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, along with Dina and Bande in Gadchiroli, and Kotri and Doodh in Kanker, severely limit commando mobility. Godavari's tributary, Shabari, and several nullahs in Gadchiroli and adjoining areas make it tough to penetrate deep into Maoist zones.Combat boots sink in wet soil and slip on slushy terrain, said an officer involved in operations. Another warned that sudden torrential rains could maroon troops or cut off rescue routes. Parts of Abujmarh in Bastar are impacted by the Indravati and Godavari rivers, while Kanker's side faces isolation due to Doodh river and other rivulets. In Gadchiroli, Bhamragarh taluka, the gateway to Abujmarh, is often rendered inaccessible.Despite the hurdles, govt, relying on tech & improved infrastructure, is determined to deny Maoists their monsoon advantage and meet the March 2026 deadline to dismantle remaining guerrilla strongholds.","Monsoon fury will pose a major challenge for security forces as they continue operations in Maoist stronghold Abujmarh.

A division bench of Chief Justice G Narendar and Justice Alok Mahra sought a detailed explanation from the authorities in this regard.The court pointed out that the state EC had gone ahead and announced poll dates last week even though related legal proceedings were still pending. The elections were scheduled to be held in two phases - on July 10 and 15 - with results on July 19. Around 47.7 lakh voters were expected to cast their votes across 12 of Uttarakhand's 13 districts (Haridwar district had been excluded from the process).The case had reached the court through petitions filed by Ganesh Dutt Kandpal and others from Bageshwar, who objected to the govt's decision to revoke the old reservation rotation system and introduce new rules on June 9 and 11, respectively. The petitioners argued that this move allowed certain seats - already reserved for three consecutive terms - to remain reserved for a fourth term, which they said was ""unfair and against the spirit of rotation, as it restricted opportunities for other candidates"".The court agreed that this contradicted its earlier instructions on fair reservation practices. While govt said a single-judge bench was already looking into related issues, the petitioners' counsel pointed out that their challenge was focused on the June 9 notification and had been specifically placed before the division bench.The single bench, they added, was examining the June 11 order separately.Meanwhile, chief standing counsel, CS Rawat, told TOI, ""The court noted that govt went ahead with the election process without issuing a gazette notification.

Stamp paper worth Rs 100 was illegally used to register the agreement between the company and National Highways Authority of India, sources said.The alleged fraud came to light after the chief secretary wrote to all district magistrates on Sept 26 last year, asking them to review the agreements being registered by toll collection agencies operating across the state. The circular was based on complaints that many of them might have short-changed the state govt by evading stamp duty.The circular cited the Supreme Court's July 19, 2024, order on a dispute between Rewa Tollway Pvt Ltd and the Madhya Pradesh govt.

Is single OBC mother's child entitled to OBC tag?

A Supreme Court bench of Justices K V Viswanathan and N Kotishwar Singh agreed to examine the issue raised by a single OBC mother for her son.Significantly, additional solicitor general S D Sanjay, representing the Centre, also favoured the apex court looking into the important issue thrown up by the petition by a woman who is separated from her husband and lives with her child. He had initially said the issue of how to determine one's caste was the prerogative of states.Not inclined to leave it to individual states to decide such cases, the bench said, ""We will lay down guidelines.""The petitioner challenged the current guidelines that provide for consideration of grant of OBC certificate to a person if he shared paternal blood relationship with a man who is already recognised as an OBC.""Considering the important issue raised by the petitioner, and subject to the orders passed by the CJI, let the matter be placed for final hearing in the month of July,"" the bench said. It also wondered whether children of an OBC woman, who had an inter-caste marriage, would also be entitled to OBC certificate.In testing the validity of the patriarchal guidelines, the SC may have to refer to a 2012 judgment of the top court which had dealt with a case relating to a tribal woman marrying an upper caste man. In its judgment in 'Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika vs Gujarat', a two-judge bench of the SC had ruled, ""The determination of caste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in complete disregard of attending facts of the case.""In an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, there may be a presumption that the child has the caste of the father. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, the husband belongs to a forward caste.""""But by no means the presumption is conclusive or irrebuttable and it is open to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show that he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. By virtue of being the son of a forward caste father, he did not have any advantageous start in life but on the contrary, suffered the deprivations, indignities, humiliations and handicaps like any other member of the community to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, he was always treated as a member of the community to which his mother belonged not only by that community but by people outside the community as well,"" it had said.In the current case under consideration, Centre said the petitioner, Santosh Kumari, is a retired teacher from Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The Union govt said it was of the view that any child born to an OBC parent, whether the parents are separated or divorced, should be entitled to an OBC certificate based on the credentials of either the OBC father or OBC mother, depending on who has custody or is actively raising the child.""In cases where an OBC certificate is to be issued based on the mother's credentials alone, it must be clearly established that the child has been living with and has been brought up solely by the mother. Additionally, a preventive mechanism should be in place to prevent any potential misuse of this benefit,"" the ministry of social justice and empowerment said in its affidavit.""OBC castes and its related subjects are matters of individual states in the country and the states need to roll out the mechanism for the same.

Legal troubles add fuel to the fire

After years of red-carpet glam, family vacations, and public admiration, the once-adored friendship between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift has reportedly come to a painful end—this time, for good. According to multiple insider sources, the fallout is not only personal but now tangled in legal drama, forcing Lively to surrender private texts to the legal team of actor Justin Baldoni . The emotional toll appears to be heavy on Lively, while Swift remains distant—and firmly supported by her current inner circle, including NFL star Travis Kelce The bond between the ""Gossip Girl"" actress and the global music sensation had been iconic. Taylor Swift, godmother to Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ three children—James, Inez, and Betty—was often seen vacationing and celebrating milestones with the couple. But those memories have now faded into silence.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out. She’s heartbroken, but she knows it’s time to let go. Taylor’s not coming back,” a source told Radar Online.Another insider close to Swift confirmed the emotional rupture: “The friendship is done.” The source alleged that Lively “exploited the Godmother of her children and manipulated the public into thinking that she was watching out for her best interests.”The emotional heartbreak coincides with a troubling development in the legal arena. Blake Lively has been ordered by a judge to submit her text exchanges with Swift in connection to Justin Baldoni’s ongoing sexual harassment case.The ruling stems from Lively herself identifying Swift as someone with whom she discussed workplace grievances.Reports also suggest Lively may have allegedly used her connection with Swift as leverage. Rumors swirled that Lively had threatened to release past messages unless Swift publicly supported her during the controversy.Taylor Swift, who was dramatically subpoenaed in the case, has attempted to maintain her distance. Yet, her silence has been interpreted as a deliberate break from the actress she once trusted.Through the storm,Swift isn’t alone. Kelce, her current partner and Kansas City Chiefs star, has remained low-key but steady in his support. While Kelce hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation, insiders close to the singer say he’s been a “calming force” during the fallout.With Taylor Swift preparing to release her next album, rumored to address themes of betrayal and trust, Kelce’s presence has reportedly been “grounding” for the Grammy-winner.Also Read: Taylor Swift breaks from Blake Lively after shocking betrayal as Travis Kelce becomes her emotional shield While the headlines continue to swirl, one thing is certain—this is no longer just celebrity gossip.

While the details are sourced from credible insights, it’s important to note that these are not confirmed moves or official statements. Readers are encouraged to take this analysis with a grain of salt and stay tuned for official updates as the offseason unfolds.)

Why the Boston Celtics Must Make a Move

The Porzingis Dilemma: Risk vs. Reward

Pros of Trading Porzingis

Cons of Trading Porzingis

The Celtics’ front office must weigh two paths:

The Boston Celtics are entering an offseason unlike any other. Fresh off their 2024 NBA championship, the team now faces tough financial choices—including a potential $140 million decision involving Kristaps Porzingis.Most championship contenders focus solely on upgrading their roster, but Boston’s situation is different. With a looming luxury tax crisis, the Celtics must shed salary to avoid financial penalties that could hamper future flexibility.As ESPN’s Bobby Marks points out, trading Porzingis could save the team $135-140 million in luxury tax next season. In a recent trade mock-up, Marks proposed a three-team deal:- Celtics receive: Brandon Clarke, Jay Huff- Chicago Bulls receive: Kristaps Porzingis, Xavier Tillman- Grizzlies receive: Talen Horton-Tucker (via sign-and-trade), Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls’ 2030 second-round pickWhile this trade would ease Boston’s financial burden, it comes at a cost. Kristaps Porzingis has been a key piece for the Boston Celtics when healthy, but his injury history makes him a gamble. Trading him now, while his value is high, could prevent future financial strain.

Islanders may trade Noah Dobson as Red Wings enter talks with major offer

Noah Dobson’s contract demands could be the trade tipping point

NHL trade rumors are heating up as the Detroit Red Wings reportedly make a push for Islanders defenseman Noah Dobson. With the 25-year-old entering restricted free agency and seeking a major payday, the Islanders may be open to moving him—and Detroit is among the first teams to inquire. Reports suggest the Red Wings have offered a package including J.T. Compher, Jonatan Berggren, and draft picks. A potential deal could shake up both teams’ blue line plans heading into the 2025 season.Following earlier reports by NHL insider Elliotte Friedman that the Islanders were exploring the trade market for their top blueliner, more specifics are starting to surface. According to Stefen Rosner of The Hockey News, Detroit has formally inquired about Noah Dobson’s availability, and they’ve already floated a package in hopes of landing the 25-year-old restricted free agent.Stefen Rosner confirmed the interest via X (formerly Twitter), noting, “The Detroit Red Wings have inquired about New York Islanders pending restricted free agent defenseman Noah Dobson. Reporter Bob Duff cites that Elliotte Friedman stated that Detroit's offer includes forwards J.T. Compher and Jonatan Berggren, with draft picks also likely being part of the discussion.”If accurate, the Red Wings' offer appears to balance veteran experience with young potential—a strategy GM Steve Yzerman has leaned into during Detroit’s rebuild.But whether it will be enough to entice the Islanders to part with their top-pairing defenseman is far from certain.Dobson is coming off the final year of a three-year, $12 million extension signed in 2022 and is now a pending RFA. What’s fueling the trade buzz even more is his rumored contract ask.According to Frank Seravalli of Daily Faceoff, “We mentioned his initial ask was $11 million per season, which will obviously come in quite lower on the next new deal… But will it be on the Island?”Currently, only Erik Karlsson, Drew Doughty, and Rasmus Dahlin make $11 million or more per year among NHL defensemen. While Dobson has flashed elite offensive upside—scoring 70 points while logging 23 minutes per game—his price tag and the Islanders’ recent draft lottery win may force GM Mathieu Darche to make a bold decision.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Connor McDavid’s Stanley Cup Final struggle may be pushing him toward change Nothing is finalized yet, but the pieces are in motion.

New Delhi: The closure of UAE and Qatar airspace late Monday night as missiles were fired from Iran towards US bases in Qatar and Iraq threw commercial air traffic completely out of gear. Hundreds of lights to and from the region — that houses mega hubs like Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi along with multiple smaller ones like Sharjah — were impacted. Flights headed there from across the world, including multiple Indian cities, were diverted, returned to origin or were put on hold. Flights headed from Lucknow to Dammam; Mumbai to Kuwait and Amritsar to Dubai were among those that turned back to the origin from over the Arabian Sea. And aircraft supposed to take off from there, remained on the ground.The India market is served by biggies including Emirates Group, IndiGo, Air India Group, Qatar Airways, Etihad and multiple smaller airlines like Akasa, SpiceJet and Air Arabia. Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi are key transit points for travel between India and rest of the world. Dozens of flights to and from India alone were impacted on Monday night itself.In a statement, IndiGo said: “In view of the evolving situation in the Middle East, some of our flights may experience delays or diversions. These adjustments are being made to ensure operations remain within safe and compliant airspace. We recommend checking your flight status regularly. If your flight is impacted, alternate options can be easily explored through our website. We continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with the relevant authorities. We appreciate your patience and understanding.”An AI Express spokesperson said: “As a result of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and suspension of Qatar airspace, Air India Express has diverted our Doha bound flight from Kochi to Muscat and returned our flight bound from Kannur. Air India Express has no aircraft on the ground in Qatar. We are monitoring the situation closely and will take all necessary precautions for the safety and security of our guests and crew, with inputs from the relevant authorities… regret inconvenience. ”The airspace closure in the region started around 9 pm (IST) when Qatar closed its airspace for commercial airliners “to ensure safety of citizens, residents, and visitors.” As a result, a large number of flights headed to Doha — including many from Indian cities — were impacted. The enroute ones diverted to other nearby places like Abu Dhabi or Bahrain; some returned to their origin cities in India; boarding for those about to depart was put on hold and others were suspended till the airspace restrictions remain in force.The point-to-point trafic between India and Doha is rather low, with the majority being one-stop transit flyers. IndiGo, the biggest Indian operator to Doha, saw the maximum impact. Its enroute flights to Doha from Delhi and Hyderabad were diverted to Bahrain and one from Kochi went to Abu Dhabi. Comments were sought from Qatar Airways and awaited till the time of going to press.Air India’s three flights were immediately impacted: one was diverted to Abu Dhabi, other returned to India and the third was put on hold. AI Express put boarding of its Doha-bound flights on hold at Indiana airports. AI Express has flights between Doha and six Indian cities — Kannur, Kochi, Kozhikode, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchchirappalli. Multiple flights headed from the west to Doha diverted to nearby cities including Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.Within an hour, the UAE airspace was also closed. That threw flights completely ot of gear. “At this point, there’s utter chaos and we can’t even guestimate the impact,” said senior official of multiple airlines.","Hundreds of lights to and from the region — that houses mega hubs like Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi along with multiple smaller ones like Sharjah — were impacted.

'Luggage to be delivered to passengers home addresses'





PATNA: Passengers arriving on two Air India Express flights at Patna's Jayprakash Narayan International Airport on Saturday morning were stunned to find that none of their checked baggage had made it to the city.What began as a routine landing turned into chaos as weary flyers circled the empty conveyor belts only to realise their belongings were missing entirely.The incident involved flights IX-2936 from Bengaluru and IX-1634 from Chennai, which landed at 8.23am and 8.50am, respectively. Passengers were directed to collect their luggage from belts 4 and 3, but after prolonged waits, it became clear that no baggage was arriving.""I waited for more than an hour, but the belt was empty,"" said Vivek Sharma, a passenger from Bengaluru.""Airport staff informed us that due to bad weather in Bengaluru, our luggage was not loaded. Despite repeated enquiries at the airline's counter, we were given no clear answers about where our bags were or when we would get them back,"" Sharma added.Tempers flared as frustrated travellers confronted airline staff.One furious flyer shouted that the airline should be shut down if it could not handle basic operations. Another demanded same-day delivery. ""All my medicines are in that luggage. I can't wait another day,"" he said.CISF personnel and airline staff had to step in to manage the crowd, assuring passengers that arrangements were being made to bring the baggage on subsequent flights. Airline representatives blamed the issue on bad weather in Bengaluru and Chennai, compounded by Patna airport's short runway. They also cited weight restrictions and safety protocols as reasons for not loading the baggage.""The luggage will be delivered to your home addresses once it arrives,"" airline staff told the crowd.Airport officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the primary issue was the aircraft's load factor. ""This happens occasionally when departing from Patna where airlines are forced to unload checked baggage to meet the maximum take-off weight. The airport's shorter runway makes it more likely,"" said an official.As of Saturday evening, Air India had not issued an official statement. Airport authorities, however, indicated that the missing luggage would likely reach Patna by Sunday.Affected passengers remained stuck with little more than their cabin bags and mounting frustration.The episode has once again placed Air India in the spotlight, raising questions about its operational preparedness and passenger communication.","Two Air India Express flights landed at Patna's airport on Saturday morning.

Yes, absolutely No, they're unnecessary





MUMBAI: Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed, an RTI response has revealed.The number of people who remained unidentified after losing their lives in train accidents on the suburban network make up 31% (14,513) of the total people (46,969) who died. They could not be restored to their next of kin despite efforts of the Govt Railway Police (GRP).Data obtained through the RTI plea by orthopaedic Dr Sarosh Mehta shows the percentage of unclaimed bodies started to rise from 2019 onward.Establishing the identity of a railway accident victim is challenging, said police personnel. Sometimes the bodies are mangled beyond recognition and belongings like phones or identity cards are not found.The GRP used to run a website called Shodh, where pictures of unidentified victims were put up along with their details and helped their families find them. But the project was wound up. The GRP also started a campaign where banners with pictures of accident victims were put up at railway stations in a bid to identify them, but passengers found them to be disturbing and they were taken off.""Typically when the victim's identity is not known, the body is kept at a morgue for 15 days to a month. The victim's photograph is sent to police stations across the metropolitan region to find out if a missing complaint has been registered by his/her family. If a claimant does not come forward, then the body is cremated or buried as per the victim's faith (if it is known),"" said a police officer. A piece of clothing or the victim's personal belongings are retained in the police records along with the victim's photo in case his/her family is traced later. Despite challenges, police teams sometimes track down the next of kin through tatoos on the victim's body or tags on his/her clothing.Dr Mehta said often the morgues are full and unclaimed bodies cannot be kept beyond a few days.Between 2002 and 2024, over 72,000 people lost their lives on railway lines due to various reasons, a majority run over while crossing tracks.Data shows overall fatalities have been decreasing every year since 2012. The only exception was 2022 when people stuck at home due to the pandemic started returning to work on the city's lifeline.Dr Mehta said that incidents like track crossing and falling off trains were preventable with measures like boundary walls and closed-door coaches.The Railways have been constructing foot over-bridges and installing escalators to discourage track crossing. But with the number of annual deaths still in four-figures, there is a long way to go to achieve the Railways' mission of zero deaths.","Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed.

With the ongoing wave of layoffs, fear of AI-driven job losses ripple through the professionals around the globe, however, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky is suggesting a more balanced perspective. He emphasises that AI will undoubtedly bring ‘a ton of disruption’ , but it will also reshape the nature of work and will create more opportunities. In an interview with Bloomberg, Roslansky linked the present technological shift to Industrial Revolution. He stressed on the fact that despite initial problems, AI will ultimately create more industries and multiple new job opportunities .Ryan Roslansky emphasised that the rise of AI doesn’t mean the end of work—it means the evolution of work. “We’re seeing a shift in the skills employers are looking for,” he noted, pointing to LinkedIn data highlighting increase in demand for AI literacy, human-AI collaboration skills and prompt engineering.""There's going to be, over time, more and more options to build careers without having to go work for a big company,"" Ryan Roslansky suggested. He also said that the skills needed for the same jobs are also evolving. For instance in India, the job skills required for the same job have changed by 40% since 2015 and he expects this figure to rise to 70% by 2030.Roslansky's views align with those of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , who has also publicly stated that people are underestimating the impact of AI on jobs but rejects the notion of a ""bloodbath."" Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, has direct advice for those who claim artificial intelligence (AI) isn't useful and yet to find practical applications for the technology, suggesting that a lack of perceived utility stems from insufficient effort. He also shared examples of how he uses the tool effectively in his daily life.“Frankly, if you haven’t found something where it's useful to you, about something you care about, then you're not trying hard enough, you're not being original enough,” Hoffman stated during an interview on The Economist podcast, broadcast this week (via Business Insider).Both LinkedIn executives emphasise on the fact that it is important for workers to shift their focus from static jobs and master their tasks by learning new skills.","LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky says AI will reshape the nature of work and create more opportunities.

NOIDA: A city businessman who had booked a cab to go to Delhi airport at dawn died after the driver allegedly fell asleep and crashed into a truck.Rakesh Kumar, CEO of TechnoConcept India Pvt Ltd, had booked an Uber at 4am on June 11 to reach IGI Airport for a flight to Bengaluru. But the car allegedly crashed into a stationary truck on the DND Flyway within minutes of the trip. Kumar died on the spot.The family of the 59-year-old businessman has now accused the ride-hailing company of negligence. They claimed the company neither alerted them about the accident nor flagged a long halt in the trip. They also said the app showed a different destination after the crash.According to his daughter, Shriti Arora, both she and her mother received a crash notification from his iPhone around 4am. ""We initially didn't understand what it meant. My mother tried calling my father several times. There was no response. I checked his location, and it showed he was still on the DND flyover,"" she told TOI.They rushed to the spot and found the car mangled under the rear of a tempo truck near the MCD toll. Passersby informed them that a man was trapped inside. ""We found my father unconscious in the car, with no pulse,"" Arora said.He was later declared dead at AIIMS Trauma Centre. The driver, Sudhir, who survived the crash, claimed a tyre burst led to the collision. But Arora said passersby told her the driver admitted he had fallen asleep. She has also shared photographs of the vehicle with all tyres intact with the police.One of the family's main grievances is Uber's silence. The company, they said, did not reach out after the accident. The app also displayed a destination change — from IGI Airport to AIIMS Trauma Centre — without explanation. The driver allegedly ended the trip around 11am, several hours after the crash.""The company should have noticed the unusually long halt,"" Arora said. ""Instead, they did nothing until we went public on social media on June 15.""Uber only responded after the family shared details of the incident online, eventually providing information about an insurance coverage.An FIR was filed at Delhi's Mayur Vihar Phase 1 police station under BNS sections 106 (causing death by negligence), a bailable offence, besides 281 (rash driving) and 125 (acts that endanger the life or personal safety of others due to rash or negligent behaviour).
