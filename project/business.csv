In what the government on Wednesday called a Diwali gift, the GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that daily-use items like hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, soap, toothbrushes, and shaving cream will now attract just 5% GST, down from 18%. GST on individual health and life insurance has been scrapped entirely. Farmers benefit too, with tractor tyres, parts, and tractors now taxed at only 5%.The changes in GST rates on services and goods other than cigarettes, chewing tobacco products, unmanufactured tobacco and beedi will be effective from Sept 22.E-way bills currently in transit will continue to remain valid as per their original validity period.Principle behind the recent rate rationalisation is to keep similar goods at the same rate to avoid issues of misclassification and disputes.Bread was already exempt while pizza bread, roti, porotta, paratha attracted different rates. All Indian breads have been exempted even though only a few goods have been mentioned as examples.These goods attracted compensation cess in addition to GST. Since it has been decided to end compensation cess levy, the tax has been increased to maintain pre rate rationalisation level of tax.Prior to rate rationalisation, paneer sold in other than pre-packaged and labelled form already attracted nil rate. The changes have been made only for paneer supplied in pre-packaged and labelled form. Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese. This is mostly produced in the small scale sector. The measure is intended to promote Indian cottage cheese.Admission to other sporting events, including recognised sporting events, where the ticket price is not more than Rs 500 continues to be exempt, and if the ticket price is more than Rs 500, it continues to be taxed at the standard rate of 18%.","GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors.

Infant mortality rate posts 1-pt decline

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year and stays well below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical report 2023 shows TFR for rural India for the first time touched 2.1 - the replacement rate, where one generation replaces itself, leading to population stability.Rates above replacement rate 2.1 suggest population growth, and the rates below that level indicate a declining population and a potential ageing population. Nationally, India's TFR touched replacement level in 2019 and was at 2.0 since 2020. TFR represents the average number of children born to a woman during her reproductive years.As per SRS report, Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) for 2023 is estimated at 0.9, which means that on average, each woman in India is having one daughter who survives to reproductive age and has children of her own. Rural GRR (1.0) was slightly higher than urban GRR (0.7), which suggests that women in rural areas are having more daughters than women in urban areas.GRR is a refined measure of fertility that accounts for future mothers and measures the average number of female children a woman is expected to give birth during her entire reproductive span conforming to the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for a given year, if there is no mortality.GRR values for major states/UTs range from 0.6 in Delhi, Bengal and TN to 1.3 in Bihar.TFR for rural areas was 2.2 in 2022 and 1.6 for urban. Going by TFR for 2023, at present, a rural woman would have about one child more than an urban woman having a TFR of 1.5 on an average.As far as states go, Bihar had highest TFR among bigger states/UTs at 2.8, followed by UP (2.6), MP (2.4) and and Rajasthan (2.3). Delhi records the lowest TFR at 1.2, followed by TN and Bengal at 1.3 each.Maharashtra stands at 1.4, while Andhra, J&K, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, and Telangana each have a TFR of 1.5. TFR in urban areas was generally lower than in rural areas across all major states/UTs in India, except Kerala and TN.\The SRSReport 2023 shows that infant mortality rate (IMR) registered a one-point decline from 26 per 1,000 live births in 2022 at the national level. Among bigger states, maximum IMR was observed at 37 each in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, & minimum at five in Kerala and three in Manipur. However, the report noted that despite this decline, one in every 40 infants at the national level die within one year of life — one in every 36 infants in rural areas and one in every 56 infants in urban areas. The report highlighted that the decline in IMR from 32 in 2018 to 25 in 2023, marks a decline of seven points over past five years and an annual average decline of about 1.4 points. The corresponding decline in rural IMR has been eight points (36 in 2018 to 28 in 2023) against a decline of five points in urban IMR (23 in 2018 to 18 in 2023). IMR for both genders have shown a decline during 2018-23. With regard to Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), in 2023, the country saw a decline of one point (29 in 2023 against 30 in 2022). There has been a decline of one point in female U5MR and no changes has been observed in male U5MR during the corresponding period.","India's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year.

The bench allowed an appeal filed by Union govt, holding that a renunciation certificate from Pakistan is indispensable and cannot be replaced by other documents.""The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognise dual citizenship,"" the court said. ""An individual can be treated as an Indian citizen only if recognised exclusively by the Indian state, without competing claims from any other country.""The case dates back to 2008 when the women's father Muhamed Maroof returned to India from Pakistan with govt permission. Maroof, born in Kannur's Kottayam-Malabar village, had moved to Pakistan in 1977 with his grandmother before working in UAE. His daughters were born in Pakistan and later shifted with the family to Thalassery.The sisters applied for Indian citizenship, producing an NoC from Pakistan high commission instead of a renunciation certificate. They said under Pakistan's citizenship law, renunciation papers can only be issued after turning 21, and by then they had already surrendered their Pakistani passports.The single bench accepted this plea.The division bench disagreed, ruling that both minors and adults must formally renounce foreign citizenship to qualify. ""Unless Pakistani citizenship is renounced under Section 14A of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, Indian citizenship cannot be claimed,"" the court said.

NEW DELHI: Migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan belonging to six minority communities — Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi — who entered India on or before Dec 31, 2024 on a valid passport or travel document or where such validity has since expired — will be exempt from penal action under the Immigration and Foreigners Act 2025, which came into force since Monday.As per the Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order, 2025 issued on Monday, citizens of Nepal and Bhutan as well as Tibetans who entered India between 1959 and May 30, 2003 on the special entry permit issued by the Indian embassy in Kathmandu, and are registered with the foreigners registration officer concerned, have been granted a similar exemption. Nepal and Bhutan citizens, if entering or exiting India via China, Macau, Hong Kong or Pakistan, will not be entitled to exemption.Section 21 of the Act — passed in April this year — states that any foreigner who enters India without a valid passport or other travel document including visa, shall be punishable with jail term up to five years or/and fine which may extend to Rs 5 lakh.

Foreigners holding diplomatic passports will not require a visa.The states/UTs have been delegated powers to enforce the Act.The home ministry on Monday also notified the compounded fines for violation of provisions of the Act; illegal entry without valid passport and visa by any foreigner — apart from the exempted categories — will invite a fine of Rs 5 lakh, payable to the FRRO concerned. Overstaying beyond validity of the visa period will invite graded penalty by FRRO/immigration officer: other than Tibetans, Buddhist monks from Mongolia, and Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Afghan immigrants eligible for long term visa who will pay fines between Rs 50 and Rs 550, foreigners will need to pay Rs 10,000 if staying up to 30 days beyond visa period, Rs 20,000 for a 31-90 days overstay, Rs 50,000 for 91-180 days overstay, Rs 1 lakh for overstay extending from 181 days to more than one year; and Rs 2 lakh plus Rs 50,000 for each additional year of stay, subject to a cap of Rs 3 lakh.

Is this the respect you show to our orders?” the bench remarked on September4, questioning the municipal body’s repeated inaction despite earlier directions.“It is very difficult to restrain ourselves but is this the way you behave? Is there any ego issue that you say the archaeology department will do?"" the bench added.The court examined a report by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who visited the site as court commissioner and flagged non-compliance with previous orders.Finding a communication gap between the court and MCD, the bench summoned the MCD commissioner to appear the same day.""We find that there is too much of a communication gap between the court and the MCD. We would thus like the commissioner of the MCD to be personally present in the court at 3 pm so that whatever order the Court passes is in his presence so that it is taken in the right spirit,"" the bench said.The judges also expressed frustration over repeated delays. ""We have been constrained to pass this order as we have been giving sufficient leverage and latitude to the MCD to come clean by showing its bonafide but we find that our hopes have been dashed by the conduct and the stand taken by the MCD,” the court observed.When the commissioner appeared, he admitted there had been a communication gap regarding the cemented portion and assured the court it would be removed.The top court has now directed the MCD commissioner to hold officers accountable and submit an action plan to fix the lapses. It also ordered that a senior officer be deputed to monitor the monument daily, with details shared with the court commissioner.Posting the matter for September 18, the bench also asked the MCD to file a report identifying officials responsible for disobeying orders and the action taken against them.The case stems from a plea filed by Defence Colony resident Rajeev Suri, who sought to have the Gumti declared a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. The Delhi High Court had dismissed his plea in 2019, following which he approached the Supreme Court.The apex court has since been issuing directions to ensure removal of encroachments, illegal occupation, and beautification of the heritage site.","Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti directed the MCD commissioner to fix responsibility on officers and submit an action plan to address lapses.

Floods submerge 87 BSF border outposts; fencing damaged along 110 km stretch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/floods-submerge-87-bsf-border-outposts-fencing-damaged-along-110-km-stretch/articleshow/123723265.cms,"AP photo

NEW DELHI: Swollen rivers spanning both the Jammu and Punjab frontiers have submerged around 87 border outposts manned by BSF and damaged border fencing in stretches running a length of 110 km, sources told TOI on Wednesday.BSF officials, however, stressed that there is no letup in border vigil despite the floods, which have affected Pakistan’s border areas equally or more. The force personnel have in fact stepped up surveillance with drones and aids like searchlights and night vision devices to detect and bust any attempts at infiltration from across Pakistan. The BSF ‘seema praharis’ are now conducting regular riverine patrols on boats and have positioned themselves in the depth areas (some distance inside the international border) or on higher ground to detect and foil any attempts by Pakistani terrorists to sneak across the international border, taking advantage of the floods.Sources said BSF is already repairing the damaged forward defence posts or high-mound posts to ensure that its personnel are safe and can keep an eye on any illegal border crossings.An officer said the flood-affected areas along the international border/LoC in Jammu division include Samba, Jammu, Akhnoor and R S Pora; while the Punjab division covers Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur, Fazilka and a few parts of other districts.The swollen rivers causing havoc in Jammu include Badi and Chhoti Tawi and Chenab. In Punjab, the Ravi and Sutlej rivers have inundated the BSF outposts as well as the fence.Sources told TOI that the fencing is currently under water in a 20 km IB stretch in Jammu frontier and a 67 km stretch in Punjab frontier. “The actual extent of damage to the fence will be known only after the water recedes. As per the current assessment, fencing is partially damaged in certain stretches and fully washed away in others,” an officer told TOI.The officer added: “Drones have been pressed to watch over infiltration attempts and foil them in real time. BSF personnel have stepped back a little to the depth areas in view of the floods. They are ensuring tight vigil and using force multipliers and technical surveillance and aids like searchlights and night vision devices to deny the terrorists the slightest chance of crossing over”.","Swollen rivers spanning both the Jammu and Punjab frontiers have submerged around 87 border outposts manned by BSF.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions, a development that comes close on the heels of his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“You cannot talk to India or China in that way,” Putting said, addressing the media after attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit and a military parade in Beijing. “The colonial era is now over. They have to realise they can’t use these terms in speaking with partners.”The Russian President accused the Trump administration of using economic pressure as a tool to undermine two of Asia’s biggest powers. He also mentioned that he debriefed Modi on the Alaska summit with Trump during his one-hour car drive with the Indian PM.Putin said the US tariff regime was an attempt to “weaken the leadership of these countries”.“You have countries like India with 1.5 billion people, China, powerful economies, but they also have their own domestic political mechanisms and laws,” he said. “When somebody tells you they are going to punish you, you have to think — how can the leadership of those big countries react?”Putin said that history weighs heavily on the political instincts of both nations.“They had difficult periods in their histories too, like colonialism, tax on their sovereignty during a prolonged period of time. If one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over. So that influences his behaviour.”Tensions will, however, eventually ease, according to the Russian President. “Ultimately, things will be sorted out, everything will take its place, and we will see normal political dialogue again,” he said.Meanwhile, Russia is stepping up fertiliser supplies to India this year and both sides will sign a pact for Arctic cooperation next year.",Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions.

""This will enable our private industry to step up R&D efforts, build production lines and assemblies to meet the requirements in a desired timeframe,"" it said.As per the roadmap, which specifies over 200 weapon systems and futuristic technologies, the armed forces require around 150 stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicles, among other types of drones, and over 500 hypersonic missiles with scramjet propulsion in the coming years as well as measures to counter them.The Navy wants nuclear-propulsion for at least 10 of its future warships, including an aircraft carrier, and 20 high-endurance autonomous underwater vehicles for anti-submarine warfare.

""Rs 90,"" said the vendor. The tourist blinked. ""For one? Wasn't it Rs 40 last year?"" Once an easy indulgence, the humble coconut has turned into a luxury in much of India's south, with prices up from Rs 15-25 just two years ago to anywhere between Rs 80 and Rs 100 now.In Kerala, the crisis has a phrase: ""Moongan irunna naayudey thalayil thenga veenu."" A coconut falling on the head of a dog that was already looking for an excuse to cry. Trouble piling onto trouble.Today's shortage can be traced to the pandemic years. Tender coconut sales collapsed in 2020-21 as supply chains froze, leading to over-mature nuts and a glut by 2022-23, crashing prices and discouraging care for trees. ""Farmers didn't replant after the 2023 crash. Now yields have dropped and recovery takes years,"" said farmer-producer group member Sunil Cyriac. Lost time cannot be reclaimed in a single season. Tall trees need five to eight years to bear fruit. Shorter hybrids, three.Climatic swings - heavy rain in 2022, drought in 2023, scorching heat in 2024-25 - left plantations reeling in Karnataka. Pests damaged 30% of output in Tumakuru, Mandya, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Chitradurga.Cyclonic damage and pest attacks hit 25% of plantations in Andhra Pradesh. In TN, root wilt disease and whitefly infestation wiped out 40% of yields in Krishnagiri and Tirunelveli.Kerala faced leaf rot disease in central and northern zones and mid-whorl yellowing in south, leading to abnormal nut fall and tree death. Rhinoceros beetles and red palm weevils added to the devastation.The festival season - Onam in Kerala, Ganesh Chaturthi nationwide - sent the market into a spiral. Copra, oil and fresh nut prices have soared as shortages deepen.Panaji market vendor Sulagna Gaunekar blamed high labour and transport costs. Tourism added pressure, with tender coconuts overharvested for quick profits, cutting into next year's yield. Goa's agriculture director Sandeep Fol Dessai cited a mix of pests, fungal infections and ""monkey menace"". He said as farmers migrated to cities, leaving plantations unattended, ""Monkeys destroyed crops.""Production for 2024-25 stood at 1,508 lakh nuts - far short of demand. Goa Horticulture Corporation rushed in 75,000 coconuts from Karnataka, selling at a subsidised Rs 40-45. They sold out in hours.Officials said the crisis was global. Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka also saw a drop in output. ""Price fluctuation had related factors - crop neglect and climate variation,"" said Coconut Development Board marketing director Deepthy Nair.Coconut oil prices reflected the strain - Rs 4,23,000 per metric tonne in India, nearly triple in two years, according to a Reuters report. Worldwide production flatlined at 3.67 million tonnes in 2024-25, the US agriculture dept reported.At beaches, markets and temples, coconuts now carry the weight of climate change, fungus, beetles, neglect and broken supply chains - all packed into a single hard shell. India remains the world's largest producer, with an estimated 15 million metric tonnes for 2024-25, according to Coconut Development Board. Karnataka leads with 28.5% of output, followed by Kerala, TN and Andhra Pradesh.","Once an easy indulgence, the humble coconut has turned into a luxury in much of India's south. Tender coconut sales collapsed in 2020-21 as supply chains froze, leading to over-mature nuts and a glut by 2022-23. Karnataka leads with 28.5% of output, followed by Kerala, TN and Andhra Pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123728253,imgsize-52720,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

No drop in overall port cargo shipments despite high US tariff: Sonowal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-drop-in-overall-port-cargo-shipments-despite-high-us-tariff-sonowal/articleshow/123723496.cms,"Sarbanand Sonowal

THOOTHKUNDI: Amid concerns over the impact of a 50% US tariff on Indian products, shipping and ports minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Friday said that there has been no reduction in overall cargo shipments from India.“We are capable of handling any challenge. There has been no reduction in cargo handled by major ports in India so far,” he said, in response to a question. Minister said domestic consumption and India’s success in bilateral trade agreements with countries have opened new avenues for Indian products.Indian ports serve as the lifeline of the country’s international trade, handling nearly 85% of EXIM (Export-Import) cargo by volume and over 70% by value.Sonowal was interacting with reporters after inaugurating and laying foundation stone for multiple projects worth over Rs 350 crore at V O Chidambaranar Port, including the country's first port-based green hydrogen pilot project. The 10 Nm³/hr pilot facility will generate green hydrogen to power street lights and an electric vehicle charging station in the port colony. The port targets to achieve green port tag by this year end. The foundation stone laid on Friday for a pilot green methanol bunkering and refuelling facility of 750 m³ capacity is aligned with the proposed Coastal Green Shipping Corridor between Kandla and Tuticorin, the shipping ministry said.","Indian ports serve as the lifeline of the country’s international trade, handling nearly 85% of EXIM (Export-Import) cargo by volume and over 70% by value.

NEW DELHI: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) are coming after age in India as a mainstream asset class and are playing “a pivotal role” in driving growth in these two sectors, according to the Indian REITs Association and Bharat InvITs Association. India currently has five publicly listed REITs — Brookfield India Real Estate Trust, Embassy Office Parks REIT, Mindspace Business Parks REIT, Nexus Select Trust and Knowledge Realty Trust. And of the 27 SEBI-registered InvITs, five are publicly listed. Both REITs and InvITs are regulated by SEBI.Terming REITs as a”critical bridge between physical real estate and financial markets,” Alok Aggarwal, MD & CEO of Brookfield India Real Estate Trust and chairman of the Indian REITs Association, said here Friday: “India’s REIT market has moved beyond its early phase to become a reliable investment avenue for both institutional and retail investors. Since their inception, the first four REITs have distributed more than Rs 24,300 crore to unit holders, demonstrating steady cash generation and disciplined governance. Building on this foundation, now five listed REITs command a combined market capitalisation of about Rs 1.5 lakh crore, reflecting growing confidence in the asset class and its ability to deliver stable, predictable distributions.” By regulation, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their net distributable cash flows to unit holders on a half-yearly basis.Bharat InvITs Association CEO N S Venkatesh said: “InvITs have emerged as a structured and transparent investment platform, well-suited to India's evolving infrastructure financing needs. They have created a distinct and credible asset class that brings long-term capital into infrastructure while offering stable returns to investors. The InvIT industry in India has witnessed significant growth, with 27 InvITs registered and cumulative distributions of over Rs 68,000 crore made since inception, underscoring its scale, stability, and increasing investor confidence. With increasing participation from diverse investor categories and a strong regulatory oversight and support from SEBI, InvITs are poised to play an integral role in supporting India’s infrastructure goals.”","REITs & InviTs coming of age as mainstream asset class in India.

The Trump administration is preparing sweeping changes to the H-1B visa program, with new regulations expected to tighten eligibility, increase compliance requirements, and alter how H-1B visas are allocated.According to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) regulatory agenda, a proposal slated for December 2025 would revise criteria for exemptions from the annual H-1B visa cap, impose stricter conditions on third-party placements, and heighten scrutiny of employers previously found in violation of program rules.Currently, exemptions from the 85,000 annual cap (quota) apply to jobs at higher education institutions, nonprofit research organizations, and government research entities. Certain workers already counted against the cap — such as those seeking to extend or change employers — are also exempt. The forthcoming rule is expected to redefine these criteria, potentially narrowing the scope of who qualifies as cap-exempt.Under the earlier Trump administration, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had issued a policy memo requiring employers who placed H-1B workers at third-party client sites to submit detailed contracts and itineraries. Employers had to prove thatwould exist for the entire duration of the requested H-1B period.This effectively limited approval periods to shorter terms (sometimes just a few months) if USCIS believed the contract didn’t cover the full three years. USCIS also applied the ‘employer-employee relationship’ test more aggressively, focusing on whether the H-1B petitioner (the staffing firm/consulting company) truly controlled the worker’s duties, salary, and supervision — or whether the third-party client did. There was a spike in requests for evidence during processing of H-1B visa applications and the rate of denials had also shot up. Later, a district court had struck down parts of this USCIS memo, which was subsequently rescinded by USCIS.In the context of the proposed rule, an immigration consultant attached to a tech company said, “It looks like the Trump administration is now seeking to strict third-party placement rules into formal regulation, rather than relying on policy memos that can be challenged in court.”Separately, DHS is set to announce a long-anticipated rule that would reshape the way H-1B cap numbers are assigned. The proposal, which was listed for publication in Aug, would favour workers offered higher wages, as measured by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS). TOI in its edition of July 22 had mentioned that a weighted selection process based on wages was on the anvil.Indians are major H-1B beneficiaries. For the fiscal ended Sept 2023, they accounted for 68,825 (58%) of initial employment visas and 2.10 lakh (79%) of extensions, far outpacing China, the second-largest source, with significantly lower allotments of 16,094 and 29,250, respectively. Thus, any change will significantly impact Indians aspiring to work in the US.The planned reform would maintain the existing ‘beneficiary-centric’ registration system — under which each worker has a single entry regardless of how many employers file on their behalf — and would not alter the order of selection between the regular 65,000 cap and the additional 20,000 slots reserved for advanced-degree holders.If finalized, the changes could significantly affect both employers and foreign professionals. Tech firms and staffing companies that rely heavily on third-party placements may face tighter restrictions, while higher-paid workers could gain a greater chance of selection in the H-1B lottery to the detriment of new graduates, including those from US universities.","The Trump administration is preparing sweeping changes to the H-1B visa program.

As India gears up to celebrate Diwali, the India’s Union Government, led by a visionary Prime Minister, left no stone unturned to increase the savings for a common man through revolutionary reforms and rate rationalisation under GST. As expected, the removal of 12% and 28% slabs will pervasively benefit key business sectors including daily essentials, healthcare, consumer electronics, automobile, agriculture etc. The reforms, when given a closer look, are reflective of significant measures to boost some of the key drivers of the economy namely – Human Capital, Private Consumption, Business Investments and Government Expenditures.As GST 2.0 was dedicated to the common man, the focus on daily essentials was indeed a highlight. From exempting key products like ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk, breads, paneer etc. to bringing down the levy to a mere 5% GST rate on butter, packaged food products etc., the measures would only serve the objective of deepening the pockets of citizens for ensuring increased private spendings ahead of the festive season.The ""COMMON MAN ITEMS"" section in the Press Release highlighted the theme of rationalization, featuring household items like handbags, umbrellas, bicycles, now made subject to a concessional 5% GST.This reduction reflects a thoughtful approach rather than a forced change, as many of these goods were previously taxed at 18%, indicating a deliberate effort to ease the financial burden on consumers while maintaining certain existing tax slabs.It was also widely noted that pursuant to the announcement of GST 2.0, sectors like automobiles and consumer electronics saw a sales dip due to anticipated rate reductions. With clearer implementation timelines, these sectors are poised for revenue growth during the festive season. While luxury vehicles maintain high GST rates , the decision to limit three-wheeler GST reductions to 18% (instead of 5%) may invite re-consideration, as these vehicles serve the rural population expected to benefit from the reforms.Moving towards agriculture, the Government walked the talk which was being echoed since the fall of tariff negotiations with the US. The dedicated support for farmers was clear with the reduced GST to 5% on essential agricultural machinery and fertilizers. Simultaneously, as the pharmaceutical sector remained exempt from the US taxes, it was only fair to grant full exemptions for essential drugs and lower levies on medical devices under GST, showcasing an effort to enhance equity in domestic trade.While the services sector too went through significant changes, the critical highlight and talking point would remain the exemptions granted to the insurance industry. As part of the Union Budget 2025-26, it is noteworthy that the Government enhanced the FDI limits in the sector to 100% under automatic routes which opened the doors for increased competitiveness in the sector through foreign players. These measures, when analysed collectively, are likely to increase the affordability of insurance products in India.Shifting the focus from rate changes, it is equally critical to note the extended focus on Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) as the Government has taken noteworthy steps by way of simplifying GST registration processes, treatment of discounts which will play a critical role in the upcoming festive season. Additionally, the measures to sanction 90% accumulated ITC refunds on preliminary risk evaluation and removing levy in intermediary services has set a tone for strengthening the position of ‘Made-in-India’ goods/ services at global stage.It was indeed pleasing to see that the Government also took note of significant challenges caused to businesses owing to delayed implementation of the Appellate Tribunals despite notifying specific rules long back. Consequently, the industry would welcome the decision to operationalise Tribunals by end of September including the clarity offered for timelines for consideration of backlog appeals and hearing.On the revenue and policy front, the Government’s decision to impose higher GST rates of 40% on luxury and sin goods, such as tobacco, pan masala, aerated sugar drinks and luxury automobiles is understandable since the move discourages harmful consumption and offsets revenue losses caused by external tariff impacts, especially US trade barriers. The higher rate structure acts as an economic shock absorber consequently fortifying the domestic market against global tariff-induced uncertainty while curbing forex outflows associated with luxury imports.While the GST 2.0 effective from 22 September 2025 delivers significant relief to end consumers, it is indeed an uplifting measure of India’s GDP as well which needed a significant push considering the $30 Trillion economy dream to be achieved by 2047. It is likely that these measures would enhance Per Capita Income levels leading to increased spendings, a critical affair amidst global tariff wars. It is also noteworthy that reforms would also entail some short-term transitional challenges to businesses such as implementing anti-profiteering measures, navigating refund of accumulated credits etc. Therefore, to ensure smooth and litigation-free implementation of these reforms, the Government may need to work closely with industry bodies to achieve the defined objectives and issue appropriate clarifications, as required.","As India gears up to celebrate Diwali, the India’s Union Government, led by a visionary Prime Minister, left no stone unturned to increase the savings for a common man.

Why Mitesh Khapra is named in Time AI 100 list

Can Lyne Originals Coolpods 11 Solve Your Problems?

Time Magazine recently unveiled its 2025 list of 100 tech CEOs, founders, leaders and other executives. The list featured prominent names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others. One name that stood out this year was Mitesh Khapra , an Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. Khapra was recognised for his efforts to make AI accessible to millions of non-English speakers in India.Mitesh Khapra is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the IIT Madras. According to his Linkedin profile, he has worked with Infosys and LG as a software engineer. He then jumped to research roles with Microsoft India and IBM before joining IIT Madras in 2016.Khapra is also a co-founder of One Fourth Labs where the mission is to provide high quality education in AI at affordable prices to build a workforce capable of building AI solutions of societal and commercial value in India. Mitesh describes Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Conversation Systems as his specialities.As per information available on Time100 AI collections page, Mitesh Khapra recognized early on that “the reason Indian language technology is behind English is because we do not have enough data for Indian languages,” he says.While Western models may perform well on highly represented languages like Hindi and Bengali, they are weaker on underrepresented languages. To close the gap, Khapra’s research lab AI4Bharat led a project that took researchers to almost 500 of India’s 700 districts, recording thousands of hours of voices from people with diverse educational and socioeconomic backgrounds to capture all 22 of India’s official languages.Co-founded in 2019, AI4Bharat became an official partner for the Indian government’s Bhashini program, which uses AI to assist citizens in accessing digital services in their own languages; AI4Bharat supplies 80% of the data with its open-source dataset. It welcomes other developers utilizing its data for their models, too. Khapra says that if big tech companies use its data to make their models better at Hindi or Marathi, “it benefits the country at large.”AI4Bharat’s AI models have been deployed in the Indian Supreme Court to translate official documents, and to create a voice bot that regional farmers can call to report issues with their government subsidy payments. The company’s latest project involves partnering with Sarvam AI—a startup launched by two other AI4Bharat co-founders—to build India’s first foundation model for the Indian government. Even if the model initially underperforms its Western counterparts, Khapra sees its creation as essential for the country’s sovereignty. “Unless we learn that skill, we will always be in a perpetually dependent position,” he says.Already Khapra sees his work helping to reshape his nation’s academic research. He says that ""15 years back, an average PhD student in India working on language technology would end up working on English problems,” but adds that “with these datasets available, I see a shift: now Indian students are working on Indian problems.""","Mitesh Khapra was recognised for his efforts to make AI accessible to millions of non-English speakers in India.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

Apple’s lead AI researcher for robotics Zian Jhang has left the company to join Meta. According to a Bloomberg report, Jian Zhang has joined the Meta Robotics Studio on September 2. As per the report, three other AI researchers have left Apple’s in-house large language models (LLMs) team. Citing unnamed sources speaking on the condition of anonymity, the report said that these three employees include John Peebles, Nan Du and Zhao Meng. They were all part of an Apple Foundation Models team. While Pebbles and Du are joining OpenAI , Meng is reportedly heading to Anthropic.So far, Apple has lost roughly 10 employees, including chief of the company’s Foundation Models team. The group was central to the creation of the Apple Intelligence platform . According to Bloomberg news, the iPhone maker is now discussing internally whether to rely more on outside technology, rather than just homegrown models.Jian Zhang, a robotics researcher, led a small team of academics studying automation technology at Apple and how AI is used in it. The team has already seen some changes, as one of Zhang’s team members, Mario Srouji, left in April to lead AI products at Archer Aviation Inc.Zhang worked with Apple for nearly 10 years. His previous works, according to his LinkedIn profile include Lecturer at Purdue University and Research Intern at Mitsubishi Electric. Zhang holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and studied at University of Washington under student exchange program. He completed his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering from Purdue University.According to a Financial Times report, many recruiters see the recent wave of departures from Apple as a “crisis of confidence” in the company’s AI plans. Apple is still working on a more advanced AI version of Siri, expected next year, but it stumbled when the new Apple Intelligence version of Siri was delayed and didn’t make it into iOS 18.At an employee meeting in August, Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi said the company has built a new Siri system that will bring big improvements in 2026.Apple is also exploring outside partners to boost Siri’s AI, holding talks with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Eugene Ling , a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor , after a report emerged that his ex-company is suing them. The lawsuit, filed two months after Scale AI secured a massive $14.3 billion investment from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, accuses Ling of stealing confidential documents containing customer strategies and other proprietary information.“Just heard I’m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that,” Ling said in a post.Ling also denies any “nefarious intent.” He stated that after leaving Scale, he asked his former employer if he could delete files from his personal drive, but was instructed not to.“When Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I’m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I’ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that’s up to them,” he said.“I’m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this,” he added.Ling’s post that came after a report by TechCrunch said that Scale AI’s lawsuit alleges that Ling ""stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information"" and attempted to poach one of Scale’s largest clients for Mercor.Surya Midha, co-founder of Mercor, told the publication that Ling may have had possession of the documents but denied that his company had used any of the data.“We have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way,” Midha said. He also revealed that Mercor had reached out to Scale AI days before the lawsuit was filed, offering to have Ling destroy the files.Scale AI's lawsuit claims that the stolen documents contained data that would have allowed Mercor to serve several of its most important clients, including a major customer, referred to in the suit as ""Customer A."" Scale alleges that winning this client away would be “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”The legal action comes just weeks after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI. Zuckerberg’s company now holds 49% of Scale AI and also hired its CEO Alexandr Wang as well as some other employees as part of the deal.

Historic and international holdings





Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle and one of the richest men in the world, is almost as famous for his vast real estate empire as he is for building one of Silicon Valley’s most influential companies. According to Forbes, Ellison’s net worth surpasses $270 billion, and he has funneled more than $1 billion into acquiring homes, resorts, private islands, and historic estates across the globe. His portfolio spans from Hawaii’s remote island of Lanai to oceanfront Malibu mansions and palatial estates in California, Florida, and beyond. Each property is not just a luxury purchase but also a reflection of Ellison’s love for art, culture, and architecture, making his holdings some of the most unique among the billionaire class.In 2012, Ellison stunned the world by buying 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million from Dole Food chairman David Murdock, as reported by Forbes. He didn’t stop there—Ellison has since invested close to half a billion dollars in the island, transforming it into both a luxury retreat and a hub for sustainability. His projects include the exclusive Sensei Retreat, which charges around $3,000 per night, Nobu Lanai restaurant, and sprawling hydroponic farms powered by renewable energy.Ellison often describes Lanai as a “laboratory for sustainability,” where experimental agriculture and wellness tourism coexist. With a private airport, pristine beaches, and luxury resorts operated by Four Seasons, Lanai has become the ultimate showcase of Ellison’s wealth and vision.Ellison’s 23-acre estate in Woodside, California, is widely considered his architectural crown jewel. Modeled after a 16th-century Japanese imperial palace, the estate cost over $200 million to design and construct, as reported by Fortune. It features an 8,000-square-foot main house, koi ponds, man-made lakes, and an authentic tea house—all designed to reflect Ellison’s fascination with Japanese culture. The home is surrounded by more than 1,000 cherry trees and maples, making it a living, seasonal work of art. The project reportedly took nearly a decade to complete and is so extensive that Ellison once joked it could be mistaken for a small village. For Ellison, this wasn’t just a residence but a personal tribute to Japanese architecture and aesthetics.Ellison is also the largest individual landowner on Malibu’s Carbon Beach, famously known as “Billionaire’s Beach.” According to The Wall Street Journal, Ellison owns at least 10 properties on this coveted stretch, valued collectively at more than $180 million. His holdings include sleek modernist mansions with private beach access and homes he rents to celebrities and high-profile figures. One of his most notable acquisitions was a $48 million estate in 2017, featuring a pool and tennis court. Carbon Beach, where homes regularly sell for over $20 million, has long been a playground for tech moguls, Hollywood stars, and financiers. Ellison’s dominance here reflects his strategy of concentrating ownership in ultra-exclusive neighborhoods, giving him unmatched privacy and prestige.Ellison has also turned his attention to Florida’s luxury coastline. In 2022, he shattered records with his purchase of a $173 million estate in Manalapan, the most expensive home ever sold in the state at the time, according to Forbes. Not stopping there, Ellison also acquired the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa for $277 million, cementing his presence in South Florida’s hospitality market. His total Manalapan investments exceed $450 million. Earlier, in 2021, Ellison purchased an $80 million North Palm Beach mansion, giving him one of the largest oceanfront properties in Palm Beach County. These acquisitions underscore his interest not only in trophy homes but also in entire resorts that generate long-term value and influence.Ellison’s taste for grandeur extends to historic estates and international properties. In Newport, Rhode Island, he owns the Beechwood Mansion, once home to the Astor family, which he bought for $10.5 million. According to Fortune, Ellison has spent more than $100 million restoring Beechwood to serve as a private art museum for his collection. He also owns the Cal Neva Lodge at Lake Tahoe, once co-owned by Frank Sinatra, and has holdings in San Francisco and Aspen. Internationally, Ellison has purchased properties in Japan, a country that has deeply influenced his architectural choices. His investments abroad further reflect his blend of cultural appreciation and ambition to create lasting landmarks.Ellison’s real estate strategy goes beyond luxury—it’s about vision. He often treats his properties as experimental grounds. On Lanai, he tests sustainable food production and eco-tourism. In Woodside, he celebrates Japanese culture. With Beechwood, he turns a historic estate into a private art museum. His Malibu holdings consolidate his position in one of the world’s most prestigious beaches. Unlike many billionaires who simply collect trophy properties, Ellison’s empire reflects his belief that real estate can combine art, culture, technology, and sustainability. For him, every home is not just a residence but a statement.","Larry Ellison is the co-founder of Oracle and one of the richest men in the world. His real estate empire spans from Hawaii’s remote island of Lanai to oceanfront Malibu mansions and palatial estates in California, Florida, and beyond. Ellison has funneled more than $1 billion into acquiring homes, resorts, private islands, and historic estates across the globe.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123712623,imgsize-114348,width-400,resizemode-4/larry-ellisons-billion-dollar-real-estate-empire-from-japanese-palaces-to-hawaiian-island-mansions.jpg"
"Elon Musk replies to Pakistani man's 'warning' to Danish man that Danes will soon be 'destroyed' in their own country, and there will only be Pakistanis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-replies-to-pakistani-mans-warning-to-danish-man-that-danes-will-soon-be-exterminated-in-their-own-country-and-there-will-only-be-pakistanis/articleshow/123624198.cms,"Elon Musk replies to Pakistani man's 'warning' to Danish man



Population collapse: Elon Musk’s ongoing concern



A global warning by Tesla CEO Elon Musk



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has one again stirred debate over global population decline . Musk recently responded to a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man. The post shared consists of a video in which a Pakistani man was seen claiming that Danes will soon be ‘exterminated’ in their own country and replaced by Pakistanis . Musk has now responded to the video claiming that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct.In the video shared a Pakistani man can be seen arguing with a Danish man surrounded by cops. The Pakistani man said, “We shall stay sitting on your hearts for the rest of life man, we have got 5 children and you have only 1 and 2.”“In the next 10-15 years there will be more Pakistanis than Danes in this country,” added the Pakistani.The Pakistani further stated “Danes are just 5 million and soon you will be exterminated. Look at Swedes, look at Norwegians, look at Finnish. We are in millions.”Another Pakistani man present in the same video said, “I got married and I am also having 5 kids tomorrow. So, go and give birth to more children man.”Replying to this video shared on X, Elon Musk replied that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct. “His math is correct,” wrote Musk.Elon Musk’s comment aligns with his repeated assertions that population collapse—not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Elon Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.Recently, Elon Musk issued a stark warning about Japan. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “Japan will lose almost a million people this year.” In the post, Musk said that this demographic was set in motion half a century ago adding that the population decline in the country “has nothing to do with AI.” “AI is the only hope for turning this around,” the tech CEO further stated.Elon Musk was responding to an X post that said: “Japan's population falling with 900,000 more deaths than births in 2024”.Recently, a report claimed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he was willing to help him finance $97.4 billion to take over ChatGPT maker OpenAI.","Elon Musk responded to a video shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man.

Rupee slips to a fresh low of 88.27 against $,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-slips-to-a-fresh-low-of-88-27-against-/articleshow/123729447.cms,"Representative image





MUMBAI: The rupee bucked the trend among Asian peers on Friday, slipping to a record low even as most emerging market currencies strengthened against the dollar. It closed at 88.27 after touching an intra-day low of 88.36, weaker than Thursday’s close of 88.15.The fall came amid concerns over US tariffs, while intervention by Reserve Bank of India through state-run banks helped limit further losses. The currency ended a volatile week largely below the 88-mark, pressured by persistent foreign portfolio outflows and significant trade-related uncertainties.Washington’s 50% tariff on key Indian exports from Aug 27, linked to purchases of discounted Russian oil, has added to the pressure. Foreign investors have withdrawn over $1.4 billion from Indian equities so far in Sept, taking this year’s outflows to more than $16 billion.Dealers said that while GST reforms had improved sentiment in the capital market, it was too early to predict the outcome on GDP growth and ability to attract foreign investors. While government officials have indicated that a trade deal with the US was likely this year, US President Donald Trump continued to berate India on tariffs.In contrast, other Asian currencies advanced on expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut this month, led by gains in the Korean won. The dollar index eased 0.22% to 98.01 ahead of US non-farm payrolls data due later in the day.","The fall came amid concerns over US tariffs, while intervention by Reserve Bank of India through state-run banks helped limit further losses.

NEW DELHI: Food delivery, quick service restaurants, as well as quick commerce (QC) players are set for a fresh bite of growth, with the recent GST reforms, a rise in discretionary spending, and an upswing in consumer confidence, say industry experts.Over the past few quarters, food delivery had lost momentum due to a weak sentiment and macro pressures, while QC profitability came under strain from heightened competition, rapid dark store rollouts, and higher customer acquisition costs, industry experts and analysts toldFood delivery demand has been sluggish in recent quarters, with gross order value (GOV) growth slowing for both Swiggy and Zomato to 18% in FY25, compared with 19-20% in FY24, but the trend appears set to reverse, an analyst from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.Further, the onset of the festive season is also poised to revive consumption, offering relief to the players.Naveen Malpani, partner and consumer industry leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, said, “The GST rationalisation is expected to unlock momentum in discretionary spending, particularly in food services and quick commerce.”With GST cuts on daily essentials and rising disposable incomes, quick commerce is likely to be one of the biggest beneficiaries, and could accelerate adoption in non-metros.“These reforms stimulate consumption, support small businesses, and provide a strong tailwind for the quick commerce sector,” Rohit Kapoor CEO, Food Marketplace, Swiggy, said in a LinkedIn post on Friday. Some industry experts, however, say food delivery platforms may see a mixed impact. “The inclusion of delivery services under Section 9(5) of the CGST Act means platforms are now liable to collect and remit GST on delivery charges. We have also seen most of the platforms increasing their delivery fees as well. This could lead to a marginal increase in delivery costs, though subscription models may help cushion the impact for regular users,” Malpani stated.Rahul Ganjoo, CEO, District by Zomato, said, “The GST Council’s decision to rationalise tax slabs will make quality experiences more accessible for urban and emerging city consumers and will also aid consumption and the economy in general.”However, Kazem Samandari, co-founder and executive chairman of L’Opéra, said, “The (GST) benefits are minimal, and indirect, such as possible lower costs for equipment and some services.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"After GST overhaul, retailers point to logistical challenges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-gst-overhaul-retailers-point-to-logistical-challenges/articleshow/123729360.cms,"



MUMBAI: Even as GST revamp will spur consumption, for companies, it also means some immediate onground challenges which they will have to tackle amid the festive rush.Whether prices of products go up or decline under the rejigged tax slabs, restickering/retagging of prices will need to be done. For consumer goods which have a shorter shelf life of not more than 15-20 days, it will not be much of a problem. Manufacturers, however, will have to compensate their retail partners for the differential in product pricing post tax rate adjustments (those that will be priced lower).For fashion retailers, it will not be so smooth. “Retagging merchandise on the floor right in the middle of the festive season will be a tough task,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of Retailers Association of India (RAI).The industry body has written to the department of legal metrology seeking a notification allowing retailers to update MRPs on unsold goods manufactured, packed or imported before Sept 22. Under current norms (Legal Metrology Packaged Commodities Rules 2011), retailers cannot alter MRP post manufacture or import without formal approval.RAI has also sought permission to affix revised price labels reflecting GST changes, some time for transition to minimise disruption and assurance against penal action for compliant updates.Stock currently held with retailers and distributors at old MRPs will need to be repriced which does present logistical challenges, said Gunjan Shah, MD & CEO at Bata India. “We are addressing this through clear in-store communication and focused training of our staff so that the transition is smooth for both teams and shoppers. Bata is committed to rolling out the new pricing by Sept 22,” Shah said.Manish Bandlish, MD of Mother Dairy said there could be some challenges with finished goods in the pipeline (which will have old pricing) with various stakeholders. “Companies will have to take a call on either compensating some of the (trade) channel partners (retailers) or sell it off beforehand. We will have to evaluate,” Bandlish said. “For FMCG, shelf life for products is largely short. So, we hope there won’t be a very big impact,” Bandlish said.During the interim period till Sept 22 when the new regime will come into effect, there is also a possibility of slow off-take from manufacturers due to concerns around accumulation of input tax credit (ITC) on inventories, said Angshu Mallick, MD & CEO at AWL Agri Business (formerly known as Adani Wilmar).","For consumer goods which have a shorter shelf life of not more than 15-20 days, it will not be much of a problem.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders. The meeting focused on artificial intelligence and investments in the United States.More than a dozen CEOs attended the event, including Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. Trump, seated between first lady Melania Trump and Zuckerberg, asked each executive to share how much their companies were investing in America.One conspicuous absence was Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX chief, once among Trump’s closest industry allies, has distanced himself in recent months following clashes over space policy and government contracts.Five Indian-origin executives — including Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Vivek Ranadive (TIBCO) and Shyam Sankar (Palantir) — were at the table. Their presence underscored the growing clout of Indian Americans in Silicon Valley and Washington, even as Trump moved to crack down on immigration.Trump brushed aside the significance of Friday’s jobs report, arguing that the “real economic numbers” will only be visible a year from now.He also downplayed current gains as being mostly construction-related and promised that the US would soon witness job growth “like our country has never seen before.”When asked if he planned to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump confirmed, “I will be, yeah. We’re having a very good dialogue.” The remark came as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on with no ceasefire in sight. Trump added that resolving the conflict had turned out to be “a bit tougher” than he initially expected, despite his claimed success in settling seven other wars.Sundar Pichai thanked Trump, telling him, “I’m glad it’s over” after a US judge threw out a landmark case that sought to break up Google’s Chrome browser. The ruling sparked a surge in Alphabet’s market value, which crossed $2.5 trillion this week. For Pichai, the dinner was a chance to reset ties with an administration that had frequently accused Google of bias.Bill Gates openly praised Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine initiative, calling it a model for rapid medical innovation. He said Microsoft was committed to helping the US government in disease research and listed ongoing projects on HIV, polio and sickle cell. Gates’ comments were made just hours after RFK Jr’s contentious hearing over vaccine policy.Trump said he did not watch health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate testimony but heard he performed “very well.” Calling Kennedy a “very good person” who “means very well,” Trump noted he appreciates his different ideas, even if they are contentious. The hearing itself was marked by heated clashes over Kennedy’s sweeping health care and vaccine policy changes.","US president Donald Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders.

TOI correspondent from Washington:: Amid the tumult of what is basically a trade war Trumpian America has declared on India, an incongruous spectacle is unfolding in Alaska between the two countries. They are in the midst of one of the largest bilateral military exercises in terms of troops mobilized by the Indian Army.In what could well be a form of good natured trolling, India on Friday underscored the ongoing Exercise Yudh Abhyas (war practice) 2025 in Fairbanks, Alaska, describing it as ""elevating India US Strategic and Defence Partnership,"" hours after Trump had suggested New Delhi and Moscow had thrown their lot with Moscow and Beijing.""Today, Yudh Abhyas stands as a flagship, high-complexity Army-to-Army exercise. It has become one of the cornerstones of India US military cooperation,"" the Indian Embassy in Washington said in a press release, underlining that ""India conducts more military exercises with the US than with any other country.""The release was accompanied by photographs of military personnel from both sides fraternizing during the 21 st edition of the exercise that commenced on September 1 at Fort Wainwright and will continue through September 14.An Indian Army contingent comprising 450 personnel led by a battalion of the Madras Regiment is training alongside US soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment (“Bobcats”), part of the 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Arctic Wolves), 11th Airborne Division, the release said.This edition of the exercise, the release revealed, emphasizes Mountain and high-altitude operations under sub-arctic conditions; Heliborne and air-mobility integration, backed by artillery and aviation assets; Electronic warfare, surveillance, and counter-drone systems; Medical evacuation and combat casualty care in field conditions; and Live-fire tactical drills to validate seamless interoperability.Since its inception in 2002 as a platoon-level exercise, Yudh Abhyas has expanded greatly both in scope and participation, the release said, adding that past editions have explored diverse terrains: high-altitude warfare in India’s Auli and Chaubattia; desert manoeuvres in Rajasthan; urban and cold environment training at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Alaska.The timing of the release mid-exercise appeared to suggest New Delhi believes the trade dispute will blow over, and longer term U.S-India engagement and equities will remain intact.""It (the exercises) demonstrates how our two democracies continue to work towards peace, security and prosperity, including in the Indo-Pacific region,"" the Embassy release said, amid concern in many quarters that Trump is down on the Quad and ready to jettison the Indo-Pacific formulation to enhance New Delhi's role in the region.Several bureaucrats have told TNN in background conversations that the US officialdom is not on the same page as the White House, where India policy is being driven by ""trade whisperers"" who are feeding into Trump's biases on the issue without regard to a broader partnership between the two countries.","India on Friday underscored the ongoing Exercise Yudh Abhyas (war practice) 2025 in Fairbanks, Alaska.

Challenges in store for green-card sponsoring companies as Trump admin looks at tightening norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/challenges-in-store-for-green-card-sponsoring-companies-as-trump-admin-looks-at-tightening-norms/articleshow/123723446.cms,"AP photo





The Trump administration has placed green card reforms squarely on its near-term agenda, signalling potential changes that could affect employers, skilled workers, and investors seeking permanent residence in the US.One of the most closely watched proposals will relate to employment-linked green card categories (EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3), which are relied upon by highly skilled professionals, researchers, and employer-sponsored skilled workers.Mitch Wexler, senior counsellor at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm explained that, “The proposed rule would define what constitutes a ‘bona fide job offer’ in employer-sponsored cases and outline the authority of immigration agencies to conduct site visits.”The proposed plan of action in this regard has been outlined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the recently issued first regulatory agenda of the Trump administration. The proposed rule is slated for publication in January 2026.Immigration experts are largely of the view that the proposed rule would translate into heightened scrutiny of job descriptions, recruitment practices, and wage offers. Employers may need to provide more documentation to prove that a role is genuine and permanent.Further, explicit authorization for USCIS for site visits means employers sponsoring green cards could face more frequent audits and workplace inspections that would push up compliance costs.DHS’s regulatory agenda outlines that the proposed rule would also codify current policy guidance and implement administrative decisions regarding ‘successorship-in-interest’ and ability to pay, If a sponsoring employer merges, is acquired, or restructures, the new company can take over the green card process — but only if it assumes the same job offer, obligations, and pay commitments. This prevents workers from having to restart the process if their employer changes.In this context, an immigration consultant pointed out, that “Smaller companies may find it harder to meet stricter financial and organizational thresholds that may be prescribed under the codified successorship-in-interest norms.”.The proposed rule would also revise (tighten) eligibility criteria for EB-1 category (meant for those having extraordinary abilities and outstanding researchers). Evidentiary requirements for the EB-1, EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) applications would also be revised. This would make obtaining green cards under these categories more challenging.Individuals can file green card applications on their own only in limited cases – such as the EB-1 category meant for those with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. However, EB-1 petitions for outstanding professors/researchers and multinational managers must be filed by an employer.The EB-2 category (meant for professionals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability) generally requires an employer sponsor and a job offer, but if applying under National Interest Waiver, an individual can self-petition without employer sponsorship The EB-3 category (meant for skilled workers with at least two years of experience, professionals with a bachelor's degree) always requires an employer sponsor and a permanent, full-time job offer.Annually the US sets aside only 1.40 lakh green cards for employment-based applicants and there is a 7% per country cap. According to a study by Cato Institute, the employment based green card backlog from India (EB-2 and EB-3 skilled category) has reached 10.7 lakh in March 2023. If factors such as death and ageing out are considered (which will lead to these individuals dropping from the backlog statistics) the wait for a green card is 54 years, else it is a whopping 134 years.Changes are also in store for the EB-5 program or investment linked green card program. In Nov, DHS is expected to publish rules implementing the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 and incorporate feedback from a 2017 public consultation on the Regional Center program. A separate rule is also likely to increase fees.DHS says the reforms are intended to strengthen the integrity of these green card programs, and align regulations with existing policy guidance and administrative decisions.Wexler adds that the regulatory agendas are an early indication of policy direction: most proposals must first be published in draft form, followed by a 30- to 60-day public comment period. Agencies are required to review feedback before issuing final rules, which also need clearance from the Office of Management and Budget — a process that typically takes several months. In urgent circumstances, interim or temporary rules may be implemented on an expedited basis.",The proposed plan of action in this regard has been outlined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the recently issued first regulatory agenda of the Trump administration. The proposed rule is slated for publication in January 2026. Immigration experts are largely of the view that the proposed rule would translate into heightened scrutiny of job descriptions and recruitment practices.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123723441,imgsize-215520,width-400,resizemode-4/dc-lawsuit-challenges-trump39s-national-guard-deployment-as-a-forced-39military-occupation39.jpg"

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.
