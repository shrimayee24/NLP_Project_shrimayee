"Big cat, big loss: In 4 years, Maharashtra has lost 142 tigers, 537 leopards, reveals RTI query",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-cat-big-loss-in-4-years-maharashtra-has-lost-142-tigers-537-leopards-reveals-rti-query/articleshow/124710563.cms,"NAGPUR: In a worrying trend, accidents, poaching, and electrocution accounted for a significant number of 142 tiger and 537 leopard deaths reported in Maharashtra from Jan 2022 to Sept 2025. The big cat fatality data was provided by the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), Nagpur, in response to a Right to Information (RTI) query.The report states that 35 tigers and 115 leopards have died in Maharashtra this year till Sept. In comparison, 26 tiger deaths were reported in 2024, 52 in 2023, and 29 in 2022. Among this year’s tiger deaths, 21 were due to natural causes, five from accidents, another five linked to electrocution and poaching, and four due to unspecified reasons.Of the 142 tiger fatalities reported since 2022, natural deaths accounted for 84 cases, while 23 were killed in accidents and 29 fell to poaching. In six cases, the cause of death remained unclear. Experts say poachers commonly use electrocution and traps in forest fringes.“Poachers target big cats mainly for their body parts and claws, which have high value in the black market. They are also killed to prevent attacks on livestock,” said a wildlife crime analyst.Leopard deaths, which stood at 115 so far in 2025, included 44 from natural causes, 42 from accidents, two from hunting, three from electrocution, and 21 from other causes. In the past, the state had recorded 144 leopard deaths in 2024, 138 in 2023, and 140 in 2022.The data was issued in response to a RTI filed by Abhay Kolarkar.The data confirms that Maharashtra’s tiger population stands at 444, as per ‘Status of Tigers in India 2022’ report published by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. Officials said most natural deaths are linked to intra-species conflicts, old age, and diseases, while accidental deaths involve vehicle hits and electrocution near forest fringes. Experts also attributed the high accident rate to highways and railway lines passing through wildlife corridors.","35 tigers and 115 leopards have died in Maharashtra this year till Sept.

"Even slight penetration is rape, consent irrelevant for minors: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/even-slight-penetration-is-rape-consent-irrelevant-for-minors-hc/articleshow/124710553.cms,"CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently ruled that even the slightest penetration constitutes rape and that consent is irrelevant when the survivor is a minor, reaffirming the absolute nature of protection under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.Dismissing the appeal of a 38-year-old driver from Hinganghat in Wardha district, the court upheld his conviction and 10-year sentence for attempting to commit aggravated penetrative sexual assault on two girls aged five and six. Justice Nivedita Mehta, who authored the judgment, held that ‘the act of rape or aggravated penetrative sexual assault stands complete as soon as the accused inserts any body part into the survivor’s private parts — the extent of penetration being immaterial in law’.The court found that the accused lured the children with guavas, showed them obscene videos, and attempted to assault them sexually. He was convicted under section 6 of the Pocso Act and section 376(2)(i) read with Section 511 of the IPC and fined Rs50,000.Justice Mehta observed that the prosecution “proved its foundational facts beyond a reasonable doubt,” relying on consistent and credible testimonies of the survivors and their mother, supported by medical and forensic evidence.“Simply because, in the medical examination conducted on the survivor after more than 15 days, no injuries were found on her private parts due to her tender age, the alleged act committed by the accused cannot be termed as an ‘attempt’ to discard the otherwise reliable and trustworthy testimony,” she said.The bench rejected the petitioner’s claim of false implication over alleged family enmity, noting the absence of any corroborative evidence. It also accepted the delay in filing the FIR, stating it was reasonable given the survivors’ young age and the threats issued by the accused.The HC further corrected the trial court’s misapplication of the amended Pocso sentencing provisions introduced in August 2019 — five years after the crime, which occurred on Feb 19, 2014. Justice Mehta clarified that punishment must be governed by the law prevailing at the time of the offence. “The trial court’s reliance on the amended provision of section 6, prescribing a minimum sentence of 20 years, as well as its invocation of section 18 of the Pocso Act for the purpose of calculating sentence, is legally erroneous,” she stated. However, the bench affirmed that the 10-year rigorous imprisonment imposed was consistent with the minimum punishment prescribed by the unamended statute and required no modification.","Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently ruled that even the slightest penetration constitutes rape.

Pune farmer receives only Rs 664 for 7.5 quintals of rain-damaged onions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pune-farmer-receives-low-onion-prices-as-rain-and-poor-policies-hurt-maharashtra-agriculture/articleshow/124709996.cms,"Onions rot, markets stagnate



'Better to destroy crops than sell'



'The day farmers get fair prices, crime will come down'



Produce from other states, stock coming to market



Poor govt policies blamed



Soyabean, old stock of toor, chana also hit



PUNE: Sudam Ingle, a farmer from Purandar, spent around Rs 66,000 on his onion crop this season. The incessant rains damaged most of his yield, but he managed to salvage a portion and spent another Rs 1,500 to pack and transport it to the Purandar market yard for sale on Friday. To his shock, Ingle received just Rs 664 for 7.5 quintals of onions.“This was from one acre of land. I still have onions from another 1.5 acres, but I won’t sell them; I’ll run a rotor and turn them into fertiliser for next year. That’s more profitable than selling,” he said. “I’m still a relatively big farmer. I don’t know how smaller farmers with just one or two acres, many of whom have taken loans, will survive. If the govt doesn’t step in, farmer suicides will increase.”Ingle’s story is echoed across Maharashtra’s farmlands, where relentless rains and collapsing prices have left farmers struggling to survive. From onions, tomatoes, potatoes to pomegranates, custard apples, to soyabean, almost every crop has taken a hit this season.With no money in hand, farmers have no purchasing power, directly affecting rural markets that flourish during Diwali. “This year, Diwali is being celebrated only in cities.In villages, there’s no money to buy even a diya,” said an APMC member from Nashik.In Lasalgaon APMC, Asia’s largest onion market, prices range from Rs 500 to Rs 1,400 per quintal, with the average stable at Rs 1,050 (Rs 10.50/kg) for the past week before it closed for Diwali. An APMC member said, “This summer (March–April), we saw a bumper onion crop. The shelf life is around seven months, so many farmers who didn’t sell then, hoping for higher prices, stored it and are selling now. The new crops faced the wrath of rains as 80% of the onion crop in the Nashik region is damaged. Even the salvaged stock is of poor quality and selling for very low prices.”Ingle said farmers spend heavily right from preparing fields, buying saplings, sowing, spraying pesticides, watering, weeding, harvesting, packing, and transporting the crop to market. “My 393 kg of onion was sold at Rs 3 per kg, 202 kg at Rs 2 per kg, and 146 kg at Rs 10 per kg, depending on the damage. Loading, unloading, weighing, and transport cost Rs 1,065. So the net amount I got after deducting that from Rs 1,729 was Rs 664,” said Ingle flatly, adding, “Being a farmer means a life of struggles. ”Manikrao Zende, who farms custard apple, pomegranate, and onions in Purandar, incurred significant losses this year. “Looking at the market rate, I ran a rotor through my onion crop which will at least help fertilise the field because selling it will increase my losses. I invested Rs 1.5 lakh in the pomegranate farm this year, but due to non-stop rains, the plants turned black, forcing me to discard them. The same happened with the 500 custard apple saplings I planted. It cost me around Rs 1 lakh, but the rains ruined them, and I had to sell them for Rs 50,000,” said Zende.Zende blamed the govt for ignoring the plight of farmers, alleging that the administration is yet to conduct a panchnama of his fields despite the destruction caused by rains. He also linked the rise in crime across the state to the growing distress in farming. “When farmer families do not have money, their children have no work. Some migrate to cities, but some stay back. The youth has no money, no job, and criminal elements easily attract this crowd. This is why we have such a surge in criminal activity among the youth. The day farmers get work and a fair price for their produce, crime will come down,” he said.The average price of tomatoes in the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC stands at Rs 1,100 per crate (20 kg). Manik Gore, a commissioning agent at the Chakan APMC and a farmer himself, said that while he usually skips the May–October season, this year he sowed soyabean on one acre of land. But nothing survived the rains. “My input cost was Rs 20,000, completely gone. The onion coming to market is spoiled due to rain. If a farmer brings 50 kg, only 10 kg or less gets a decent price, and the rest is sold at Rs 2–3 per kg. Onion and potatoes from other states like UP and Gujarat are flooding the markets. Good-quality potatoes sell at Rs 10–15 per kg, but the input cost per acre is around Rs 40,000. Considering that, whatever we are getting now is nothing. Farmers around Pune are still better off, but 80–100 km away, their situation is heartbreaking,” said Gore.Gore said poor govt policies have worsened the onion crisis. “Onion was getting good prices, but India banned exports in 2023. Other countries swooped in on our market share, and when the ban was finally lifted, we lost our clients in the international market. If the govt can ban exports when prices rise, should they not buy onions at a good price when the market crashes? That never happens. Farming means a life of suffering,” he said.According to Ramesh Suryavanshi, a trader at Latur APMC for soyabean, one of the biggest in India, 50% of the soyabean crop in the region was damaged due to rains. “The average price of good soyabean (12-2-2 which means maximum 12% moisture, 2% impurities (foreign matter), and 2% damaged kernels) is between Rs 4,100 to Rs 4,250. But the ones destroyed by moisture are selling for as low as Rs 2,000- Rs 3,000 per quintal which doesn’t even cover half of the input cost in growing the crop,” said Suryavanshi adding that farmers are hoping procurement centres will open soon.Even the farmers and traders who kept the old stock in hopes to sell it when the markets improve are forced to sell at low prices. “The rates for soyabean have not improved for two years now and even the rates of chana and toor dal are poor. Good quality chana is being sold at Rs 5,400-Rs 5,500 but the damaged ones are selling at Rs 3,000. Same with toor dal which is selling maximum at Rs 6,800. Farmers can’t even buy the bare minimum for Diwali. And because farmers lost their purchasing power, other Diwali businesses are also affected. The overall situation is gloomy,” said Suryavanshi.","Rains and collapsing prices have left farmers struggling to survive.

India records extreme rainfall during southwest monsoon 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-records-extreme-rainfall-during-southwest-monsoon-2025/articleshow/124709544.cms,"KOCHI: Nearly half of India witnessed extreme rainfall during southwest monsoon of 2025. According to a report by Climate Trends released on Friday, 45% of India’s landmass experienced extreme rainfall during this season.In the last 10 years, from 2016 to 2025, five years registered above-normal rainfall, two years recorded normal rainfall and three years witnessed below-normal rainfall in the country. It stated that southwest monsoon of 2025 recently concluded with ‘above-normal’ rainfall, amounting to 108% of the long-period average (LPA). This is the second consecutive year in last decade to record above-normal rains.West Coast has the second biggest contribution to the total monsoon rainfall. While Konkan and Goa made a significant contribution, top performer Kerala reported normal rainfall but, on the negative side, with a deficit of -13%. State recorded 1,752.8mm of rainfall during the four months against the normal of 2,018.6mm.Wayanad, which was affected by landslides last year, reported the highest rainfall deficiency of -36%, followed by Idukki at -35% and Malappuram at -27%.Increased sea surface temperature in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal led to greater moisture loading or higher evaporation, making rainfall events extreme.“Monsoon seasons are not the same anymore. The last 10 years recorded normal to above-normal rainfall, with the latter being more prominent. Monsoon amplification and intensification are directly linked to global warming. Global warming became the biggest driver of monsoon now. The influence of El Niño and La Niña has been decreasing in the global warming era. The number of rainy days has decreased, but the quantum of rainfall has increased. The daily quantum of rainfall underwent a significant change,” said K J Ramesh, former director general, IMD “Behavioural patterns of monsoon systems have changed drastically, altering rainfall patterns as well. We now see low-pressure areas spending more days than their average period over the land, maintaining their strength. This is mainly because of increased and continuous moisture feed over the land. Not only have extreme rainfall events increased, but there has also been a rise in cloudburst-like conditions. This was not the case earlier,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet Weather.","45% of India’s landmass experienced extreme rainfall during this season.

Silver market crisis 2025: Panic in London! How the market broke – Is demand in India the cause?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-crisis-2025-panic-in-london-how-the-market-broke-is-india-to-blame/articleshow/124693366.cms,"Silver market crisis 2025:

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Is India leading the buying frenzy?

London in panic!





The perfect storm





Is India responsible?









The global silver market is facing its most severe crisis in decades, and for once, the epicenter of the turmoil isn’t just Wall Street or London— Is India to blame?As the country celebrated Diwali, millions of people flocked to buy silver, turning a seasonal ritual into a market-breaking frenzy. For Vipin Raina, head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, the scale of demand was unprecedented.Raina had been preparing for months for a surge in silver purchases by Indian customers ahead of Diwali, the festival honouring the goddess of wealth. But when it came, it blew everything away. His company, India’s largest precious metals refinery, ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.“Most people who are dealing silver and silver coins, they’re literally out of stock because silver is not there,” Raina, who is head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, told Bloomberg.“This kind of crazy market — where people are buying at these levels — I have not seen in my 27-year career,” Raina added.While India’s Diwali demand is usually gold-heavy, this year saw silver take the spotlight. Social media and market hype fueled the shift. According to the Bloomberg report, investment banker and content creator Sarthak Ahuja, with nearly 3 million followers, promoted silver as the “next big buy” after gold’s historic rally.“It’s never been like this before. The demand this time for silver has been humongous,” Amit Mittal, GM at M.D. Overseas Bullion told Bloomberg.Premiums for silver in India surged above $5 an ounce, far exceeding the usual few cents above international prices. Dealers in Mumbai reported bidding wars, with buyers prioritizing availability over cost.But the frenzy for silver wasn’t confined to India. Global investors and hedge funds joined the surge, betting on a weaker US dollar or simply following the unstoppable rally. By early October, JPMorgan Chase, a key supplier to the Indian market, warned clients that it had no silver to deliver for October, with the next availability only in November.The buying spree hit London, the global hub for silver trading. Traders described a market “all but broken” as banks struggled to quote prices amid repeated client calls and thin liquidity. Robin Kolvenbach, co-CEO of Argor-Heraeus, said, “There is more or less little to no liquidity actually available in terms of leases in London. We have basically stopped all silver intake that is not committed contractually.”The spike in silver prices reached $54 an ounce, before tumbling 6.7%, reflecting extreme stress across the market. Analysts compared it to historical crises, including the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, underscoring the severity of the situation.The 2025 silver crisis was not triggered by a single factor but by a convergence of events that drained global inventories and pushed the market to the brink. India’s Diwali demand played a key role, as millions of buyers turned to silver instead of gold, creating unprecedented pressure on domestic and international supplies.Over the past five years, silver demand has consistently exceeded supply from mines and recycled sources, driven largely by a solar industry boom using silver in photovoltaic cells.Since 2021, demand has outstripped supply by 678 million ounces, while London’s total inventories stood at around 1.1 billion ounces at the start of 2021, according to the Silver Institute.Market stress intensified this year as traders rushed to front-run potential U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, moving over 200 million ounces of silver into New York warehouses.Adding to the pressure, more than 100 million ounces flowed into global silver ETFs through September, as heightened investor demand for precious metals fueled a rally that also propelled gold past $4,000 an ounce for the first time in history. This coincided with a surge in investment demand through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), part of the so-called “debasement trade,” as investors sought a hedge against a weakening US dollar.The combined effect of these forces left London’s free-floating silver reserves, metal not tied up in ETFs—dropping to less than 150 million ounces, far below the daily trading volume of roughly 250 million ounces.Even in ideal circumstances, moving silver from Comex to London can take four days, but delays at customs and complex supply chains left traders exposed to high costs when contracts couldn’t be fulfilled on time. Comex inventories fell by more than 20 million ounces in two weeks, the largest drop in 25 years, benefiting logistics firms but stressing the market further.According to the Bloomberg report, some traders hesitated due to the risk of new tariffs on critical minerals, while TD Securities analyst Daniel Ghali noted that the London market had been primed for a squeeze for over a year.After the frenzy peaked, silver prices plunged more than 5% following signs of improving US-China relations, with Ghali suggesting further pressure may ease as silver flows in from New York and China.“The logistics were a little more complex than we initially assumed,” Ghali said. “We certainly did not expect the scale of the retail-buying bonanza across the globe that ensued while the London market was getting squeezed.”At the same time, China, a key supplier of silver, was on a week-long holiday, reducing the flow of metal into global markets.In essence, a perfect storm had formed: festive demand, industrial growth, investment mania, and trade-related hoarding converged, creating a market under extreme stress and unprecedented volatility, reported Bloomberg.While India’s Diwali buying played a major role, the crisis also reflects structural supply-demand imbalances built over years. Since 2021, silver demand has outpaced supply by 678 million ounces, largely due to industrial demand and ETF accumulation.Yet, the timing and scale of India’s purchases acted as the catalyst, turning an already tight market into a full-blown global squeeze, the Bloomberg report said. Analysts like Satish Dondapati, fund manager at Kotak Asset Management, point to the FOMO factor. “Analysts, bullion dealers were all giving bullish calls on silver in Indian media in a way that has not happened in the last 14 years. The FOMO factor has worked,"" Dondapati stated.The silver market remains under stress as the world waits for sufficient deliveries to ease the crunch. While regulators like the London Bullion Market Association have not intervened, citing genuine supply shortages rather than logistics issues, the current situation underscores the fragility of global metals markets in a hyper-connected world.","India's largest precious metals refinery ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%?

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Upgrading strike capability: India tests 800-km BrahMos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upgrading-strike-capability-india-tests-800-km-brahmos/articleshow/124694864.cms,"‘Pinpoint Accuracy’ Rajnath Singh Praises BrahMos Precision During Operation Sindoor

Poll What do you think is the most significant advantage of the BrahMos missile system? Extended strike range and precision Faster deployment and versatility

NEW DELHI: In what will be a major boost for its precision strike capabilities, India plans to begin inducting the new 800-km extended range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles in a little over two years, while over 200km Astra air-to-air missiles are also slated for production in 2026-27.Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, to ensure the conventional (non-nuclear) missile is fully ready by end-2027, top defence sources told TOI.The existing 450-km range BrahMos missiles, which fly at almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, were launched from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for the targeted strikes deep into Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in May. “The 800-km BrahMos is more or less developed in terms of the modifications to its ramjet engine. A few more tests are required to test the efficacy of its combination of internal INS (inertial navigation system) and external global navigation satellite systems to ensure high accuracy, resilience and resistance to jamming,” a source said.Navy, for instance, can then begin upgrading the existing 450-km BrahMos missiles on its frontline warships to the 800-km variant, with just some tweaking of the software, the ‘graphical user interface’ of the fire control system and the like.“With the basic missile and launcher remaining the same, Navy and Army will first begin inducting the 800-km missile. The air-launched version will take slightly longer,” the source said.Parallelly, DRDO is increasing the beyond visual range (BVR) of Astra Mark-2 missiles to over 200km from the earlier 160km, while IAF is inducting over 280 Astra Mark-1 missiles with 100km range.“Along with trajectory shaping, the propulsion system is being upgraded to generate more thrust and burn for a longer time. If the trials are successful, Astra Mark-2 production can begin in six months. Otherwise, it will take a longer,” another source said.IAF has already finalised the plan to induct an initial 700 Astra Mark-2 missiles for its Sukhoi-30MKI and Tejas jets. There is also an Astra Mark-3 on the way, with solid-fuel ducted ramjet (SFDR) propulsion to increase the range to 350kmm but it will take three years to become operational. The all-weather day and night capable Astra series of missiles are crucial because they will eventually replace the expensive Russian, French and Israeli BVR air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) that are imported to arm IAF fighters.During its strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, IAF was initially caught off-guard by Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 BVRAAMs with ranges over 200km, as was reported by TOI earlier.The BrahMos air-to-ground missiles launched from stand-off distances were, however, an unqualified success. The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.In March last year, for instance, defence ministry had inked the largest-ever Rs 19,519 crore deal for procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for Navy. Around 20 warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the vertical-launched BrahMos missiles.After Sindoor, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council in Aug had also given the preliminary nod for IAF to get another 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles for around Rs 10,800 crore.The land variant of the 800-km BrahMos missiles will also eventually be part of the proposed Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), along with the Pralay ballistic missiles (400-km range) and long-range land-attack cruise missiles (derivatives of the original Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range), among others.","Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades.

'You Gave Sleepless Nights To Pak': PM Modi Hails INS Vikrant and BrahMos Role in Operation Sindoor

What PM Modi said

""Today is an amazing day. This scene is memorable. Today, on one side, I have the ocean, and on the other, I have the strength of the brave soldiers of Mother India.""

""Being close to you, feeling your breath, sensing your heartbeat, and seeing the sparkle in your eyes, I realised something profound. I slept a little early yesterday, which I normally don’t do. The reason I slept early was that after observing you all day, the sense of fulfilment I felt inside was not my own sleep, but the sleep of contentment""

""It is my privilege to celebrate this sacred festival of Diwali among all you brave warriors of the Indian Navy. The night I spent yesterday on INS Vikrant is beyond words to describe.I saw the enthusiasm and joy on your faces. The way you portrayed Operation Sindoor through your songs was truly moving.""

""I extend my heartfelt Diwali greetings to the families of all you brave soldiers.Everyone wishes to celebrate Diwali with their family. I too have grown accustomed to spending this festival with my loved ones.That is why I have come among you — because you are my family. So that I too can celebrate Diwali with my own.And that is what makes this Diwali truly special for me.""

""The deep night over the sea and the sunrise that followed have made this Diwali truly special for me in many ways. Therefore, I once again extend my warm Diwali wishes to all of you. And from the valiant deck of INS Vikrant, I convey heartfelt Diwali greetings to every citizen of our nation.""

""The extraordinary coordination between our three services brought Pakistan to its knees in record time.""

""The Indian Navy is like the guardian of the Indian Ocean.""

""I was observing the strength of the military equipment. These large ships, aircraft that move faster than the wind, these submarines, they are impressive in themselves, but what makes them truly formidable is the courage of those who operate them. These ships may be made of iron, but when you board them, they become living, breathing forces of the armed services. I have been with you since yesterday. In every moment, I have learned something. When I left Delhi, I thought I would live this moment myself. But your hard work, penance and dedication are on such a high level that I could not truly live it. I did, however, gain an understanding of it. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to truly live this life.""

""Just a few months ago, we witnessed how the very name Vikrant sent waves of fear across Pakistan.Such is its might — a name that shatters the enemy’s courage even before the battle begins. This is the power of INS Vikrant.""

""The fear generated by the Indian Navy, the extraordinary skill displayed by the Indian Air Force , the bravery of the Indian Army, and the tremendous coordination among the three forces compelled Pakistan to surrender so quickly during Operation Sindoor.

Most importantly, heartfelt Diwali wishes to your families as well.

""You all must remember the day our nation received its very own indigenous INS Vikrant. On that very day, the Indian Navy bid farewell to one of the greatest symbols of colonial legacy.Inspired by the valour and vision of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, our Navy adopted a new ensign that truly reflects our pride and identity.Today, INS Vikrant stands as a powerful symbol of Atmanirbhar Bharat and the spirit of Made in India.""

""Thanks to the valour and determination of our security forces, India has achieved a remarkable milestone in the past year — the near elimination of Maoist extremism. Today, the nation stands on the verge of complete freedom from Naxalism.Before 2014, nearly 125 districts were under the shadow of Maoist violence. That number has now fallen to just 11.For the first time, over 100 districts are celebrating Diwali free from the grip of Maoism.""

The agency had attached Royal Rajvilas after the project got entangled in multiple cases of fraud, cheating and money laundering.

SC has, however, clarified that it has passed the order on the peculiar facts of the case without going into the merits, and so it shall not be treated as a precedent and questions of law shall remain open to be decided in an appropriate case.","SC lauded ED for helping the homebuyers.

Mahagathbandhan's promises

Rs 2,500 per month



200 units free electricity



It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a woman in Bihar, in possession of her vote, must be courted with the utmost care — especially when elections are near. Both the ruling coalition NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan have recognized this fact with admirable zeal, offering pensions, bank transfers, honoraria, and schemes.The NDA’s pre-poll push has leaned heavily on the DBT model, taking cues from other states to ensure direct, timely transfers. From the Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, which deposited Rs 10,000 each into the accounts of 75 lakh women, to nearly tripling pensions for widows, the elderly, and the disabled, the government has sought to combine social welfare with political messaging.The Mahagathbandhan, meanwhile, has countered with its own promises, including Rs 2,500 per month for women under the “Mai Behan Maan” scheme and 200 units of free electricity for households. While the NDA’s measures have already begun reaching beneficiaries, the opposition pledges are positioned as corrective steps to perceived gaps in the current administration’s welfare framework.Against this backdrop, the question arises: will these schemes genuinely sway women voters, or will they be seen as another round of political maneuvering in the lead-up to the elections?Taking lessons from Maharashtra’s “Ladki Bahin Yojana” and Haryana’s “Lado Laxmi Yojana”, Bihar followed the DBT playbook to woo women voters.Just months ahead of assembly elections, Nitish Kumar-led government rolled ""Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana"". With Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressing the button from Delhi, Rs 10,000 each went straight into the bank accounts of 75 lakh women across Bihar.The Rs 7,500-crore scheme was pitched as a push for women’s empowerment through self-employment and livelihood generation, though its timing carried a clear political pulse.Taking the social security route, Nitish Kumar nearly tripled pensions for widows, the elderly, and the disabled. Monthly allowances rose from Rs 400 to Rs 1,100, benefiting over 1.9 crore people.The enhanced amounts were credited directly to beneficiaries’ bank accounts by the 10th of each month.Asha workers saw their honorarium jump from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000, while Mamta workers’ incentives doubled to Rs 600 per delivery. The government framed it as recognition for their key role in boosting rural healthcare, but the timing ahead of assembly elections gave it an unmistakable political undertone.The move is expected to have benefited 95,000 Asha workers and 4,600 Mamta workers.In yet another women-centric push ahead of elections, Prime Minister Modi launched the “Jeevika Nidhi” financial scheme for rural women entrepreneurs in Bihar. The initiative aimed to ease access to credit for women associated with the state’sself-help groups. As part of the launch, Rs 105 crore was transferred to the institution’s account, with PM Modi calling the move an “auspicious start” and crediting women’s empowerment as a key pillar of India’s development.Under the scheme, all cluster-level federations underbecame members of a new cooperative society jointly funded by the Centre and the state. The system functioned entirely online to ensure faster, more transparent transfers directly into women’s bank accounts.The Mahagathbandhan promised that women from deprived sections in Bihar would receive Rs 2,500 per month under the “Mai Behan Maan” scheme if the alliance formed the next government. The proposed initiative aimed to provide direct financial support to women and ensure timely transfers through streamlined registration.The alliance also pledged to strengthen social security for women, presenting the scheme as a step toward both economic empowerment and political inclusion, contrasting it with the current administration’s lower and irregular payouts.The Mahagathbandhan promised to provide 200 units of free electricity to consumers if it forms the next government in Bihar. The initiative was presented as a measure to ease household expenses and attract voter support ahead of the assembly elections.However, months later, the Bihar government announced free electricity for up to 125 units for domestic consumers.","Both the ruling coalition NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan have offered pensions, bank transfers, honoraria, and schemes.

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has finalised a technology transfer agreement with a Pune-based defence company for the production of the unexploded ordnance handling robot (UXOR), which is designed to neutralise ordnance weighing up to 1,000 kg.The agreement with DRDO positions Sagar Defence Engineering as one of the primary industry partners, alongside Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), for scaling up production of UXOR units, which are set to be deployed by the IAF to enhance operational safety during unexploded ordnance handling missions across sensitive zones, including forward airbases and strategic installations, a company source told TOI.Developed indigenously by DRDO over the last decade, UXOR represents a quantum leap in autonomous and semi-autonomous bomb disposal systems. Its key features include high-powered water jet cutting technology, precise disarming of explosive ordnance by cutting through bomb casings up to 25 mm thick and performing remote operation from a distance of up to 2 km — meaning operators can manage high-risk ordnance from a safe distance, thus reducing the possibility of human injuries or casualties.UXOR enables cross-terrain mobility, allowing operations on surfaces, such as airstrips, tarmacs and rugged terrains, and is capable of continuous six-hour missions, suitable for extended bomb disposal or reconnaissance operations.Sources familiar with the project said UXOR has undergone extensive trials with the IAF, including simulated bomb disposal exercises and real-world field testing at secure locations. Its performance has reportedly exceeded expectations, particularly in precision handling and operational reliability under stress conditions.Under a ToT agreement, DRDO will provide Sagar Defence, alongside BEL, with complete access to UXOR’s design documentation, manufacturing protocols, software integration, quality assurance standards and field maintenance procedures. A senior source hinted that this initiative is part of a broader DRDO strategy to increasingly involve private and public sector partners for rapid deployment of advanced defence technologies, reducing reliance on in-house production.The contract requires delivery of multiple UXOR units over the next two fiscal years, training of IAF personnel in robot operation, maintenance and emergency protocols and field deployment support during initial operational integration at selected bases.","The unexploded ordnance handling robot (UXOR) is designed to neutralise ordnance weighing up to 1,000 kg.

Piyush Goyal Says India Aims to Remain the Fastest-Growing Large Economy for the Next 20 Years

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, representing 134 companies from 27 countries, including India, has urged world leaders to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon resilient economy.The CEO-led alliance, one of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) flagship decarbonisation initiatives, has issued an open letter calling on govts to deepen public-private collaboration to unlock the full potential of the climate economy at a time when the transition is under threat. It underlined the current trajectories that suggest that global warming could exceed 2 degrees Celsius by mid-century, with severe consequences on economies, societies and ecosystems.The Alliance companies have a combined emissions footprint of 5.2 gigatons, accounting for 14% of global emissions — equal to the annual emissions of the US, which second after China. The group represents $4 trillion in revenues and 12 million employees in 134 companies.Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance, launched alongside the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change.CEOs of big tech multi-national companies are also part of the group.The WEF noted that these companies reduced aggregate emissions by 12% while growing revenue by 20% from 2019 to 2023, proving that climate action is compatible with driving growth.Their open letter, released by the WEF this month, calls for 13 action areas to accelerate the transition and drive growth. It highlights the need for policymakers to provide more stable frameworks, shorten permitting processes, scale climate finance, support breakthrough technologies, phase out unabated fossil fuels and invest in nature and resilience.“Climate action is no longer just a moral imperative — it is a powerful driver of green growth, innovation and resilience,” said Sebastian Buckup, managing director, Centre for Nature and Climate, WEF. “We urge govts and business leaders to act decisively and accelerate proven solutions so we can unlock the full potential of the climate economy and secure a more prosperous, sustainable future for all. Our work at the forum aims to connect leaders for people, planet and sustainable progress,” the WEF quoted him as saying.The Alliance’s open letter highlights that the corporate leaders across the world have made significant investments in building low-carbon and climate resilient businesses in the recent years, proving that climate initiatives can drive long-term value for business and society.“However, this momentum now faces strong headwinds. The cost of the transition, combined with policy obstacles and uncertainties, fiscal pressures and geopolitical tensions, is slowing the transition. COP30 presents a pivotal moment for business and government to reignite progress towards a more resilient and environmentally sustainable economy,” say the CEOs in their joint open letter to govts.They suggest that the policy-makers can drive growth and create wealth by accelerating the transition by maintaining a stable and predictable policy environment; mitigating the financial risk of private investments and projects; doubling financing and incentives for breakthrough tech; transitioning away from unabated fossil fuels; removing transition obstacles such as lengthy permitting processes; and supporting investments and policies for nature.Their remaining suggestions in the list of 13 proposed actions include building climate-resilient economies and food systems; adopting science-based targets and reporting transparently on progress on emission reduction; working together across the value chain to drive low-emission end products and business models; leveraging efficiency solutions to reduce energy usage, costs and emissions; strengthen innovation and digital solutions; support creation of demand signals; and investment in climate adaptation and resilience.","Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance.

BENGALURU: The feud between Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar and two of Bengaluru’s most prominent corporate captains — Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai — escalated Sunday over the city’s crumbling infrastructure.Mazumdar-Shaw hit back at Shivakumar’s remarks that those criticising govt’s handling of Bengaluru’s civic issues had a “personal agenda” and had remained silent during previous administrations.“Not true. Both TV Mohandas Pai and I have criticised deteriorating infrastructure in our city to previous BJP and JD(S) govts. Our agenda is to clean up and restore roads,” she wrote on X, tagging the deputy CM’s statement.Pai amplified her remarks, reposting several comments slamming the poor state of roads and public infrastructure.Unfazed, Shivakumar said industrialists who built their fortunes in Bengaluru were now turning against the city. “They are forgetting their humble beginnings and how the city helped them grow. We should not forget our roots,” read a statement from his office after his ‘Walk with Bengaluru’ event.He listed ongoing infrastructure projects — tunnel roads, elevated corridors, double-decker flyovers, and buffer roads — costing more than Rs 1 lakh crore, claiming they aim for “integrated development” of the city.“We have formed five corporations to take governance closer to people,” he added.Later in the day, Mazumdar-Shaw softened her tone and responded positively to the Ejipura flyover project update. “This is a positive development which will greatly relieve traffic congestion and has been 10 years in the making, which previous BJP and JD(S) govts did not prioritise. Putting this on a priority track is a good move by DK Shivakumar,” she posted on X.The public spat underscored growing frustration among Bengaluru’s business bosses and citizens over chronic traffic snarls, delayed civic projects, and governance gridlock in India’s technology capital.For his part, Pai had said the city’s infrastructure was “lagging 10-15 years behind its growth”.

The Senate on Monday voted against reopening the govt for the 11th time, extending the shutdown to three weeks as both sides remain at odds and unable to resolve the deadlock.The chamber voted 50-43 on the House-passed continuing resolution to fund the govt through late November, falling short of the 60 votes required for passage. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev. ) and Angus King (I-Maine) once again crossed party lines to side with Republicans. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), who had previously supported the measure, did not vote on Monday. Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) was the sole Senate GOP “no” vote, Hill reported.The vote occurred days after the “No Kings” rallies in Washington and across the country, with Republicans hopeful that a deal could be reached with those events now behind them. However, there are few indications that the impasse will be resolved soon, suggesting the shutdown may continue into a fourth week and potentially into November.The federal government shutdown is now rippling across agencies, forcing hundreds of thousands of employees off the job and leaving others uncertain about their pay.The federal government employed nearly 2.3 million civilian employees as of March 31.According to the Congressional Budget Office, roughly 750,000 are being furloughed each day — barred from reporting to work until the shutdown ends. Essential workers continue on duty but will only receive back pay once funding is restored, according to the AP.Meanwhile, the administration has begun targeting thousands of federal workers for termination in what officials describe as a “bureaucratic downsizing.” A reduction plan affecting several employees across Treasury, Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing has already been announced. White House budget chief Russ Vought said onthat the total number could exceed 10,000, calling it a rare “opportunity to shutter the bureaucracy.”A federal judge has temporarily blocked the dismissals, citing possible political motivations. Still, the White House insists it will prevail in court.The shutdown’s economic toll is mounting. The CBO estimates that paying furloughed workers during the closure costs $400 million a day. The U.S. Travel Association says the travel economy alone could lose $1 billion a week, while small business loans and flood insurance renewals have been frozen. The FAA reports air traffic controller shortages from Boston to Houston, triggering widespread flight delays.Food banks in Washington, D.C., and beyond have ramped up efforts to assist federal workers living paycheck to paycheck.Politically, both parties are sharing the blame. A new AP-NORC poll finds 60% of Americans fault President Trump and congressional Republicans, while 54% also blame Democrats for the ongoing impasse.The White House has further inflamed tensions by suspending $18 billion in infrastructure funds and canceling $7.6 billion in clean energy grants, moves critics say disproportionately target Democratic-led states.With both sides refusing to negotiate under pressure — and no clear exit strategy — the shutdown shows no sign of ending soon.",The Senate on Monday voted against reopening the govt for the 11th time.

Here is his outlook for gold prices in the coming days:Gold and Silver continued to mark new all-time highs last week as well, only to lose strength on the last day. Safe haven buying was witnessed amid renewed US-China trade tensions and deepening geopolitical and economic uncertainties. Gold inched towards $4,400 level gaining more than 60% year-to-date, driven by safe-haven demand, expectations of further US interest rate cuts, strong ETF inflows, and robust central bank buying.Silver also soared, crossing $52 on COMEX — an all-time high — as acute global supply shortages and backwardation signalled severe tightness in the market. Domestic premiums surged, reflecting heightened volatility.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese exports and fresh export controls on US software, while China expanded its rare earth export restrictions. Tensions escalated with reciprocal port fees and threats over Chinese oil imports from Russia.Amid a prolonged US government shutdown, key economic data releases may be delayed, amplifying market anxiety. Fed Chair Powell, at the NABE conference, indicated that future rate decisions would be data-dependent, acknowledging persistent labor market weakness and inflation risks. The IMF raised its global growth forecast but warned of headwinds from the trade war.However, on the other side of the story, President Trump quickly took a softer side, keeping the market unsure regarding the 100% tariffs on China, over the weekend ceasefire was on the side lines and attacks continued. In India, soaring bullion prices during Dhanteras led to a shift from jewellery to coins and bars, as gold reserves crossed $100 billion. MCX also revised margin requirements for Gold and Silver, effective October 14.Gold and Silver also amidst the signs of extreme elevated prices eased off from all time levels, where silver fell by more than 5% in a single day.

How to pay new fees

Who are the F-1 and L-1 visa holders ?





A month after US President Trump announced a jaw-dropping $100,000 price tag for certain visa applicants, the administration has finally spilled the details on how to pay up—and who might get a free pass.USCIS on Monday rolled out a payment portal and clarified that only applicants with a receipt showing the fee has been submitted can move forward, while some, like student visa holders, might dodge the surcharge entirely.The new USCIS guidelines said existing visa holders, which include international students on F-1 visas and professionals on L-1 visas, will not have to pay $100,000 when they apply for a change of status to H-1B.“It says the fee only applies to cases filed for people outside the United States, so they can come in,” said Dan Berger of Green & Spiegel in an interview, as per Forbes.“Employers were nervous about doing change of status because the $100k might apply if they travel.”The guidance explicitly states, “The Proclamation also does not apply to a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 21-2025, that is requesting an amendment, change of status, or extension of stay for an alien inside the United States where the alien is granted such amendment, change, or extension.Further, an alien beneficiary of such petition will not be considered to be subject to the payment if he or she subsequently departs the United States and applies for a visa based on the approved petition and/or seeks to reenter the United States on a current H-1B visa. ”However, the guidance also states that an employer would need to pay the fee if USCIS determines, such as by denying an application, that an individual is ineligible for a change of status or an extension of stay.For example, USCIS states the H-1B fee would apply if the individual “is not in a valid nonimmigrant visa status or if the alien departs the United States prior to adjudication of a change of status request.”USCIS states that any holder of a current H-1B visa, or any alien beneficiary following petition approval, can travel in and out of the United States. According to USCIS, “The Proclamation does not apply to any previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas, or any petitions submitted prior to 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 21-2025.”Petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment using pay.gov, following the instructions on pay.gov at the following link: https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/1772005176 After clicking on the link, it states: “Use this form to pay your H-1B VISA PAYMENT TO REMOVE RESTRICTION.” Many employers hope it may be possible to gain an exception from the fee to file H-1B visas for individuals located outside the United States.According to the section of the presidential proclamation addressing an exception, “The restriction imposed . . . shall not apply to any individual alien, all aliens working for a company, or all aliens working in an industry, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary’s discretion, that the hiring of such aliens to be employed as H-1B specialty occupation workers is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. ”The USCIS guidance appears more restrictive and less welcoming than the language of the proclamation. The USCIS guidance inserts words or phrases that do not appear in the proclamation, including “extraordinarily rare,” “high threshold,” “significantly undermine” and “no American worker is available to fill the role.”According to USCIS, “Exceptions to the $100,000 payment are granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security in the extraordinarily rare circumstance where the Secretary has determined that a particular alien worker’s presence in the United States as an H-1B worker is in the national interest, that no American worker is available to fill the role, that the alien worker does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, and that requiring the petitioning employer to make the payment on the alien’s behalf would significantly undermine the interests of the United States. ”The F-1 Visa (Academic Student) allows you to enter the United States as a full-time student at an accredited college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in a language training program. You must be enrolled in a program or course of study that culminates in a degree, diploma, or certificate and your school must be authorized by the U.S. government to accept foreign students.And the L-1A nonimmigrant classification enables a US employer to transfer an executive or manager from one of its affiliated foreign offices to one of its offices in the United States. This classification also enables a foreign company that does not yet have an affiliated U.S. office to send an executive or manager to the United States with the purpose of establishing one.The employer must file a Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with fee, on behalf of the employee.","USCIS on Monday rolled out a payment portal and clarified that only applicants with a receipt showing the fee has been submitted can move forward.

Around 13.4 million migrant workers live in Saudi Arabia, nearly 42% of the population.

Millions come from South and Southeast Asia, including India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.

An estimated 4 million are domestic workers, often isolated and vulnerable to abuse.

Why is Saudi Arabia abolishing it now?

What’s changed under the new system?

Freedom to change jobs: Workers can move to a new employer without needing approval from their current one.

Freedom to exit: They can leave the country without an exit visa or sponsor consent.

Legal protections: Workers will have improved access to labour courts and complaint mechanisms.

How much will life really change?

Implementation gaps remain: many employers still demand consent for job changes or control exit visas.

Domestic workers among the most vulnerable may not benefit equally from new protections.

Recruitment abuses in origin countries (like high fees and contract substitution) are still common and not addressed by Saudi law.

Why this matters





For over half a century, a single word defined the lives of millions of foreign workers in the Gulf: kafala, Arabic for “sponsorship.” It decided whether they could change jobs, whether they could leave the country, and whether they could fight back against abuse. It was a system critics compared to “modern-day slavery.”Now, for the first time in 50 years, that system has officially been abolished in Saudi Arabia, where roughly 13 million foreign workers make up the backbone of the economy. But what exactly was the kafala system? Why was it so controversial? And how much will life really change for those who lived under it? The kafala system was a legal framework that governed the employment and residency of migrant workers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. It emerged in the 1950s, when oil-rich economies needed cheap labour to build cities and infrastructure but wanted to avoid granting permanent residency or citizenship.Under kafala, a foreign worker’s legal status was tied entirely to their employer, or kafeel. This sponsor controlled their visa, their right to live in the country, and often their ability to change jobs or even exit the country. Without the sponsor’s approval, workers could not:The system was designed to minimise state bureaucracy and regulate labour through private sponsors.But in practice, it created an enormous power imbalance. Employers could confiscate passports, withhold wages, or threaten deportation, and workers had almost no way to challenge them.Over the decades, kafala became one of the most criticised labour systems in the world. Human rights groups and the International Labour Organization (ILO) accused Gulf governments of enabling forced labour and human trafficking under the guise of sponsorship.Because workers risked arrest or deportation if they left their jobs without permission, many remained in exploitative or abusive situations — particularly in domestic work, construction, and agriculture. In extreme cases, NGOs documented conditions resembling indentured servitude.The scale was staggering:The decision to abolish kafala, announced in June 2025, is part of Vision 2030, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s sweeping plan to diversify the Saudi economy, attract foreign investment, and modernise its global image.The move also reflects mounting international pressure. Ahead of high-profile events and partnerships, Gulf states have faced criticism from global rights groups, Western governments, and even multinational companies over their labour records. Qatar, for instance, introduced partial reforms ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Saudi Arabia says it is replacing kafala with a contract-based employment system that aims to restore agency to workers. Key changes include:Officials say the reforms will boost productivity, reduce exploitation, and improve Saudi Arabia’s reputation among investors and the international community.The announcement is a breakthrough but experts caution that legal reforms alone won’t end abuse overnight.Rights groups point out that:“Changing the law is the first step,” says Human Rights Watch. “Changing the reality on the ground will take much longer.”For millions of migrant workers from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, and beyond, the end of kafala is more than just legal reform, it’s a restoration of basic rights long denied. The ability to walk away from an abusive employer, to leave the country freely, or to seek justice without fear marks a fundamental shift in how Gulf economies treat the workers who sustain them.For Saudi Arabia, it’s a signal to the world that the kingdom is serious about modernisation and understands that economic reform must go hand in hand with human rights reform. But as activists note, this is not the end of the kafala story — it’s the beginning of a new chapter. The true test will be whether Saudi Arabia enforces these rights in practice and whether other Gulf states follow its lead.The abolition of the kafala system is undoubtedly one of the most significant labour reforms in the modern Middle East in recent decades. It promises freedom, dignity, and legal protection to millions of vulnerable migrant workers, but the gap between law and lived reality remains a challenge that will ultimately define the next phase of the Gulf’s labour history.","Kafala was a legal framework that governed the employment and residency of migrant workers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

Income tax refund: Is your tax refund delayed?

How to check income tax refund status:

Why your income tax refund may be delayed: Top Reasons

(Amarpal S. Chadha is Tax Partner at EY India and Shanmuga Prasad is Director at EY India)





ITR filing FY 2024-25 income tax refund status: With improved technology and faster processing systems, income-tax refunds are now issued more quickly than ever. However, if for some reason the refund is getting delayed, there are simple ways to track where your money is and when it will reach you.The quickest place to start is the Income-Tax e-Filing portal: log in with PAN and password, go to e-File → Income Tax Returns → View Filed Returns and check the status of return processing against the relevant assessment year. Once the status shows as tax return is processed with either refund or tax payable, the same can be cross checked in the intimation which is sent by the Tax Department to the taxpayers via email or can be downloaded from the e-filing portal.In case the refund status is shown as processed with refund due, the next step is to check if the refund determined has been released or not. This can be checked on the e-filing portal in the Services → Know your refund status by entering the relevant Assessment Year. However, not all refund status can be checked by following this process. For example, if refund due has been determined on or before 31st March 2023 (typically refunds relating to Assessment Year 2022-23 or prior), refund status cannot be checked through this service, but through the NSDL/TIN portal (https://tin.tin.nsdl.com/oltas/refund-status-pan.html) by entering the PAN and assessment year.If your refund is delayed, do check for reasons: sometimes the tax department offsets refund against earlier unpaid tax demands. To confirm this, log in to the e-filing portal and visit Pending Actions → Response to Outstanding Demand. The portal lists any outstanding demands against your PAN and gives options to “Pay Now” or “Submit Response” (agree / disagree). If a demand exists, the system may adjust your refund against it. Hence, resolving or disputing the demand promptly is important for smoother processing of refunds.It is also important to have a validated bank account (PAN linked) on e-Filing portal for receipt of refunds. Validated bank account details can be checked at e-Filing portal under Profile -> My Bank Account -> Revalidate/Add Bank Account (if applicable). Further, in case refund is not getting released due to non-validation of bank account, one can raise a refund reissue request on the e-filing portal under Services → Refund reissue which will automatically request for information of bank account which needs to be linked/validated.Given that currently the tax return itself has an option to validate the bank account, this step of bank account validation through e-filing portal is mostly relevant for prior year refunds which are still not released due to invalid bank accounts.Though refund processing is quicker today, it is equally important for taxpayers to stay proactive. Regularly checking the income-tax portal, addressing outstanding demands promptly, and keeping records accurately help avoid delays, and in case of complex issues, seeking professional guidance is advisable.","With improved technology and faster processing systems, income-tax refunds are now issued more quickly than ever.

Waqf Golden Visa: The UAE eyeing for strategic significance

Looking ahead: How to get started

Awqaf Dubai – for donation guidelines and nomination

GDRFA Smart Services – for Golden Visa application

Nearest Amer Centre in Dubai – for in-person support and document submission.





In a landmark initiative that underscores the UAE’s growing emphasis on humanitarianism and social sustainability, the country has announced that donors to Islamic endowments known as Waqf will now be eligible for the coveted UAE Golden Visa.The decision was unveiled following a strategic agreement signed between the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai (GDRFA-Dubai) and the Endowments and Minors Affairs Foundation (Awqaf Dubai). The announcement came during GITEX GLOBAL 2025, one of the region’s largest technology and innovation exhibitions, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre.The initiative now enables both UAE residents and international donors to obtain a 10-year renewable Golden Visa under the specific category of “Financial Supporters of Humanitarian Work”, as clearly laid out in Cabinet Resolution No. 65 of 2022. The move is specifically aimed at encouraging high-impact charitable giving, positioning Dubai as a global hub of generosity, tolerance, and community-driven innovation.Officials say the Golden Visa will not just serve as a token of appreciation for philanthropists, but also as a strategic tool to attract global supporters of sustainable humanitarian work worldwide.“This agreement represents a pioneering model of government integration that empowers endowers to play a vital role in community development,” said Lt.Gen. Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of GDRFA-Dubai.Waqf, in Islamic tradition, refers to a perpetual charitable endowment. This could be in the form of land, buildings, cash, or other valuable assets set aside for public benefit—such as supporting education, healthcare, or religious institutions. The key feature of Waqf is that once donated, the asset cannot be sold or inherited. Instead, it is managed sustainably, with its revenue used for community development.In the UAE, Waqf is regulated and promoted by Awqaf Dubai, which ensures all endowments are Sharia-compliant, transparent, and channelled into meaningful causes.To qualify for the Golden Visa under this new category, donors must fulfil several conditions:According to officials, the scheme is expected to boost charitable contributions while offering donors several tangible benefits:Awqaf Dubai Secretary-General Ali Mohammed Al Mutawa called the initiative a “natural extension of Dubai’s vision to position endowment work as a key partner in sustainable development.”The Golden Visa scheme for Waqf donors is being seen as a forward-thinking policy that not only aligns with Islamic charitable values but also resonates with the UAE’s long-term vision of sustainable, human-centered growth.It also broadens the appeal of the Golden Visa, which is already available to investors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and outstanding professionals in fields like medicine and engineering.Officials believe the latest addition will attract global philanthropists, foster cross-border partnerships in social development, and further establish the UAE as a beacon of generosity and inclusive progress.With this strategic move, the UAE is strongly reinforcing its long-term commitment to becoming a leading global humanitarian capital. The innovative partnership between GDRFA-Dubai and Awqaf Dubai is also expected to usher in a new era of digitally-enabled, impactful social initiatives, wherein charitable giving is not just encouraged but actively integrated into national development policy and sustainable growth.Those interested can begin by visiting:","United Arab Emirates announced new Golden Visa for Waqf donors.

What is the difference between e-Arrival Card and e-Visa?







The government has rolled out a new digital system for foreign nationals entering India.Beginning October 1, 2025, travellers can now submit an electronic arrival form instead of the traditional paper card.The initiative aims to simplify entry formalities, improve efficiency at airports, and enhance data accuracy.As per ET, the e-arrival card is part of the government’s broader efforts to digitise immigration procedures and make travel to India smoother for international visitors.According to ET, the e-arrival card can be filled and submitted online through three official platforms — the Indian visa website (https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/), the Bureau of Immigration website (http://boi.gov.in), or the Su-Swagatam mobile app.Travellers can complete the process up to 72 hours before their scheduled journey to India.The government has announced that the paper arrival form will continue to be accepted for the next six months.However, as per information shared on the US Embassy’s website, foreign travellers are encouraged to opt for the e-arrival option for “a faster and more efficient customer experience.”This digital alternative aims to reduce queues and manual data processing at airports while allowing travellers to complete formalities in advance.Passengers must visit https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/earrival/ to access the new digital form. The form requires accurate personal, travel, and contact details.Under ‘Personal Details’, travellers must provide their full name (as per passport), nationality, passport number, and purpose of visit. In the Arrival Details section, travellers should enter their arrival date and list countries visited in the past six days before submitting the form online.According to the US Embassy, the e-arrival form is entirely separate from the e-visa process.“US citizens should note that this arrival form change is separate from the e-visa application process. US citizen travellers are now able to travel to India with a valid e-visa (or physical visa from an Indian embassy/consulate) AND a valid e-arrival form,” the embassy clarified.","The government has rolled out a new digital system for foreign nationals entering India.Beginning October 1, 2025, travellers can now submit an electronic arrival form instead of the traditional paper card.

Markets will also stay shut on October 22 for Balipratipada. Regular trading will happen on Monday, October 20.This year’s Muhurat session will be held from 1:45 pm to 2:45 pm, breaking from recent tradition where trading took place in the evening.

The tradition, observed for decades, blends faith with finance — reflecting optimism, prosperity, and the belief that investments made during this hour bring good fortune in the year ahead.Historically, Dalal Street has celebrated the occasion with gains: the BSE Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the last 18 Muhurat sessions, including a 5.86 per cent rise in 2008 amid the global financial crisis. In 2024, it extended its winning run, gaining 335 points (0.42 per cent).Though the trading window lasts just an hour and often sees high volatility due to thin volumes, investors view the session as a ritual of renewal rather than a profit-making opportunity.","Muhurat Trading marks the beginning of Samvat 2082, ushering in a new Hindu financial year marked by prosperity and optimism.

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

"Diwali flat dispute in Mumbai: Only man & mother can stay in his flat, not 2nd wife & kids; HC cites ex-wife’s objection",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/only-man-mom-can-stay-in-his-flat-not-2nd-wife-kids-bombay-hc/articleshow/124713174.cms,"The Bombay High Court has issued a decision that restricts a man from celebrating Diwali in his Mumbai flat with his second wife and their children, allowing only his mother to join him for the festivities. The court expressed concern over the emotional impact this arrangement might have on his ex-wife, who claimed their presence would be distressing for her.

MUMBAI: Bombay high court in an interim order permitted only a man and his mother and not his second wife and their two children to stay in his flat in Andheri West during Diwali vacation. His former wife objected to him bringing his family to stay there.""We are of the considered opinion that if the newly (sic) wedded wife of the applicant and their children are allowed to stay in the said flat, there would be further disharmony between the parties,"" said Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Sandesh Patil on Friday.The man moved HC to restrain his ex-wife by herself or through her family members/servants from obstructing him, his mother, his wife and their children's access to his own flat and from disturbing their use, occupation and possession of the flat. The couple married in March 1999 and have a daughter. In Aug 2022, the family court allowed the husband's application and dissolved the marriage on grounds of cruelty. It directed the matrimonial house- 4BHK flat- shall be divided into two equal portions. Both filed appeals in HC against the order.After divorce, the husband remarried and resides in Thailand with his wife and two minor children. Following a stroke in 2024, he took treatment in India.In April 2024, his ex-wife did not allow him to stay in the flat. His advocate said the family wants to migrate to India. She said he is currently in India for Diwali vacation. On Sept 24, the ex-wife's mother opened the door and insulted him. On Sept 26, his ex-wife did not permit him to enter the flat. Therefore, he sought interim relief from HC.The ex-wife's advocate said she doesn't mind him and his old mother staying in the flat. If he is allowed to bring his wife and child out of the new marriage, ""it will definitely cause much trauma and concern to her"". He has another house and can stay there.The judges noted their pending appeals will take some time to be decided on merits. They took note of the man's contention that during the April 2024 visit, his ex-wife created a ruckus and threw food prepared for his children. Considering the premise of further disharmony, the judges deemed it fit to allow only him and his mother to stay in the flat. They clarified the ""present arrangement is made only on a temporary basis as the applicant wants to stay in the said flat during Diwali vacation""."," Bombay High Court allows only a man and his mother to stay in his flat during Diwali vacation.

Apple stock reaches record high! Tech giant nears $4 trillion valuation; iPhone 17 sees high demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-stock-reaches-record-high-tech-giant-nears-4-trillion-valuation-iphone-17-sees-high-demand/articleshow/124713086.cms,"5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Apple is about to touch $4 trillion market valuation as the tech giant's shares soared to lifetime highs on Monday. This lift came on the back of early sales of its new iPhone 17 series, which exceeded expectations in major markets.According to research firm Counterpoint, the latest iPhone 17 outsold the iPhone 16 series by 14% in the first ten days of availability in China and the United States, signalling strong consumer demand.The rally pushed Apple shares up 4.2% to $262.9, lifting its market capitalisation to about $3.9 trillion and making it the world’s second most valuable company after AI-chip leader Nvidia, as per a Reuters report.Evercore ISI, which recently added Apple to its Tactical Outperform List, expects the company to surpass market forecasts for the current quarter and issue positive guidance for December.Analysts noted, ""The recent launch of online orders in China may be a positive tailwind for the Dec-qtr, as initial delivery time data reflects stronger initial demand relative to other regions at launch.""Apple introduced its latest line of iPhones in September, including a slimmer iPhone Air, while keeping prices steady amid US tariff concerns.""They rolled out the latest version of their iPhone and it's doing much better than anticipated ... the demand trends for the company's iPhones are now on the front foot,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.Earlier this year, Apple shares faced pressure due to tough competition in China and uncertainty over high US tariffs affecting major manufacturing hubs like China and India. The stock began recovering in August after Apple pledged $100 billion in additional US investment, a move expected to help it sidestep potential tariffs, Reuters reported.If Monday’s gains hold, it would mark Apple’s biggest one-day rise in four weeks, taking its yearly gains to more than 5%.
