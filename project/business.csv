NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged its concerns over the authenticity of data being fed into the Jal Jeevan Mission’s (JJM’s) Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), noting that the quality of uploaded information is essential to fill the visible gaps in the ambitious scheme of providing functional tap water connection to every rural household in the country.The panel -- standing committee on water resources headed by BJP Lok Sabha MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy -- in its report tabled in Parliament on Monday also noted the absence of annual assessment of the functionality of tap water connections in 2023.The annual assessment of functionality is vital to ensure long-term source and system sustainability and corrective measures by states/UTs based on its findings.“Being aware of the fact that actual veracity of uploaded information is essential for realising the actual ground situation and filling the visible gaps, the Committee reiterate its recommendation that the department (of drinking water and sanitation) makes sincere efforts to ensure the authenticity of the data being fed on the IMIS,” said the report.While the panel observed that the department has cited a number of steps being taken by it for water quality monitoring and surveillance, it noted that the govt “has not furnished specific reply” on ascertaining the veracity of the information uploaded by the states/UTs on JJM-IMIS.On the panel’s observation over the absence of annual assessment, the govt, in its reply, told the committee that the department has received the final report of the functionality assessment survey.It said the department’s approval of the report is in final stages and will be released and shared with states shortly for requisite course correction.Launched in Aug 2019, the JJM was meant to cover all 19.32 crore (approx) rural households in the country by 2024.

The horror of partition

Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to victims who suffered during India's 1947 Partition on the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, remembering the ""upheaval and pain endured by countless people"" after the unplanned partition.PM Modi said it's the day to honour the grit of people who faced ""unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh"".""India observes #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, remembering the upheaval and pain endured by countless people during that tragic chapter of our history. It is also a day to honour their grit...their ability to face unimaginable loss and still find the strength to start afresh,"" PM Modi wrote on X.The PM further said: ""Many of those affected went on to rebuild their lives and achieve remarkable milestones. This day is also a reminder of our enduring responsibility to strengthen the bonds of harmony that hold our country together.""Union home minister Amit Shah said August 14 is the day to ""remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition"" and lashed out at the Congress party for dividing the nation -- calling it the dark chapter of history.""Today is a day to remember and honour the pain of those who suffered the tragedy of Partition. On this day, the Congress divided the nation, wounding the pride of Mother India. Partition unleashed violence, exploitation, and atrocities, forcing millions to leave their homes. I offer my heartfelt tributes to all those who endured this suffering. The nation can never forget the history and anguish of Partition. I also pay homage to those who lost their lives in this dark chapter of our history,"" Shah wrote on X.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said: ""Every Indian still carries a sense of compassion for those affected families. We remain fully committed to further strengthening social harmony in the country.""""I pay tribute to all those brothers and sisters who endured the horrific consequences of hatred and violence following India’s Partition in 1947, and who suffered the loss of lives and property,"" he wrote on X.External affairs minister S Jaishankar also said that the partition caused ""immense suffering and had far-reaching human and strategic consequences.""""On #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay, we recall the resilience of those who endured this terrible tragedy. There are many lessons to be learnt from this painful chapter,"" the minister wrote on X.The Partition of India in 1947, which created the separate nations of India and Pakistan, was one of the most defining and traumatic events in South Asian history.Born out of political deadlock between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, and hastened by the British decision to leave, the division was drawn hastily along religious lines by the Radcliffe Commission.The result triggered one of the largest human migrations in history, with around 14–18 million people crossing borders -- Hindus and Sikhs moving to India, Muslims to Pakistan.The upheaval unleashed horrific communal violence, massacres, abductions, and sexual assaults, leaving more than a million dead and countless others scarred for life. Entire trains of refugees were attacked, villages were wiped out, and families were torn apart overnight.To ensure the memory of this tragedy endures, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 declared August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day ().The day is marked with tributes to victims, exhibitions, archival displays, and public messages reflecting on the human cost of Partition, with leaders urging unity and a commitment to never let such divisions and bloodshed occur again.","PM Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to victims who suffered during India's 1947 Partition.

NEW DELHI: A bench headed by Justice J B Pardiwala, which had recently passed scathing remarks against a Allahabad high court judge for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil matter, was a portrait of restraint when it found itself dealing with a similar case on Wednesday.""This time I am not going to lose my cool,"" Justice Pardiwala said at the outset with a smile on his face.The case before it, in which an FIR was filed against a couple for not paying their dues to a seller, who lodged a complaint for recovery of the money, had been adjudicated by the Rajasthan high court . Granting anticipatory bail to the couple, the court said that litigants were forced to move the apex court for relief because proper law was not being applied by lower courts and high courts, which leads to unnecessary litigation and harassment of litigants. In this case, the couple had purchased plywood from a seller and paid Rs 3 lakh but then allegedly refused to pay the balance amount of Rs 12 lakh, making the seller file a case against them. tnnThe bench held that the problem of not following well-settled law was prevalent across the country and said a little application of mind by HCs would go a long way in curbing such litigation.Appearing against the couple, state govt questioned their conduct, as they had been on the run.The bench, however, said this could be because of the fear of police.The bench also disapproved of the stand of the public prosecutor before the HC, contending that it would not be possible to recover the money if bail was granted to the couple. ""According to the state, police machinery is required to be involved in the recovery of money. Why do you want police to be involved for recovery of money - to squeeze the remaining amount for the seller?"" it asked the advocate appearing for the state.",The bench held that the problem of not following well-settled law was prevalent across the country.

When and how to conduct SIR is Election Commission's exclusive domain: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-and-how-to-conduct-sir-is-ecs-exclusive-domain-supreme-court/articleshow/123292709.cms,"SC: Voter list can't be static, must be revised periodically

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court prima facie disagreed on Wednesday with the argument that the Election Commission had no authority to conduct an intensive revision of electoral rolls and observed that it was within the sole domain of the poll panel to decide when and how to conduct the exercise. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said that the SIR being conducted in Bihar is voter friendly and not exclusionary.The bench's remark came when senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, excoriated EC for conducting an ""unconstitutional"" exercise at its whims and fancies to ""delete"" voters from the draft Bihar electoral rolls. This also led the justices to emphasise that election laws and rules leave it to the EC's discretion to devise the procedure for conducting SIR for any constituency.""It is the exclusive prerogative of EC to decide how and when to conduct special revision of electoral rolls,"" the bench said, adding that if there are irregularities or errors in the procedure of conducting SIR in Bihar, it would seek a response from EC and correct it, if needed.""EC has not undone the entire voter list. It has taken the 2003 voter list as a milestone and presumes pre-existence of voters,"" the bench said.It can't be argued that there is complete absence of power with EC to conduct special revision of electoral rolls. The law says it can be done constituency-wise and in such a manner as EC deems proper,"" the bench said.West Bengal, through senior advocates Sankaranarayanan and Kalyan Banerjee, raised the issue of SIR being conducted without mandatory consultation with state govt. The bench said the state's challenge to SIR can wait till the adjudication of the petition against the revision of Bihar's electoral rolls.Senior advocate A M Singhvi attempted to persuade the court to allow the 2003 list, with additions as of the last general elections, to be the electoral roll for the upcoming Bihar elections . ""No one is against SIR, if it is conducted in Dec 2025 and the exercise takes a year,"" he said.The bench disagreed. ""Instead of seven documents specified earlier for revision of electoral rolls, EC has expanded it to 11 documents. It shows the exercise is voter friendly and not exclusionary,"" said the justices.Singhvi said the documents, apart from Aadhaar, ration card and voter ID card, are available only with a minuscule percentage.Sankaranarayanan argued that the right to be included in an electoral roll is a constitutional right if a person did not suffer any of the specified disqualifications. The bench said, ""The voter list cannot be static. It must be revised periodically.""Advocate Prashant Bhushan said, ""I can give guarantee that not more than 25% of the over 7 crore people who submitted enumeration forms have not submitted any document supporting their nationality. Booth-level officers, as per whims and fancies, have not recommended a whopping 10% to 12% of people in... Darbhanga and Kaimur for inclusion in the voter list.""He said EC had put the draft voter list on its website after Aug 1 but removed it on Aug 4 after Rahul Gandhi held a press conference about ""voter manipulation"". SC said, ""We do not know of any such press conference.""Senior advocate Shadan Farasat said the names of 65 lakh deleted from the draft voter list must be restored. SC said, ""We cannot bring the dead back and make them vote."" Arguments will continue on Thursday.","Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said that the SIR being conducted in Bihar is voter friendly and not exclusionary.

Consider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: SC to UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consider-converting-noida-to-a-metropolitan-council-sc-to-up/articleshow/123292648.cms,"Form citizen advisory board for Noida in 4 weeks: SC to UP government



NEW DELHI: Nearly half a century after New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) came into existence, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked UP government to consider replacing it with a metropolitan council for people-centric governance.The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority, finding, among other things, decision-making centralised in the hands of a few officers.Accepting SIT's recommendations, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered: ""In order to infuse transparency and fairness as well as a citizen-centric approach in the day-to-day functioning of Noida, we direct UP chief secretary to place the recommendation... before the council of ministers for an appropriate decision.""Till that decision is taken, the bench directed the chief secretary to post a chief vigilance officer, who should be an IPS officer or an officer on deputation from CAG, in Noida for a financial audit.According to SIT, Noida officers were involved in 20 cases of excess payment of compensation to landowners. Led by IPS officer SB Shiradkar, SIT also concluded that Noida's land allotment policies favour builders, and there was a lack of transparency and fairness in the development authority's overall functioning.It sought an inquiry into assets of officers and their relatives for a proper look at who benefited from excess compensation that Noida paid out.Commenting on the functioning of Noida, SIT said discretionary powers exercised by its officers in allotment of land is such that very soon, there will be no land available in Delhi's neighbouring city for future development purposes. It also flagged the lack of process to garner public view and conduct environment impact assessments for projects in Noida. SIT said residents often complain of delay and inadequate resolution of grievances, as Noida Authority acts reactively rather than proactively.The Justice Kant-led bench directed the chief secretary to set up a citizen advisory board for Noida in four weeks and banned giving effect to any project in Noida without environmental impact assessment and clearance from SC's green bench.In the 20 cases where excess compensation was paid to landowners because of alleged collusion of Noida officials who were identified by SIT, the bench constituted another SIT to conduct a probe into each of these officers and register FIRs on detection of a cognisable offence. It asked the authority to grant sanction for prosecution against delinquent officials within four weeks of SIT seeking it.""The SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of commissioner of police will register preliminary enquiries (PEs) and proceed to inquire into the illustratively highlighted points (in the previous SIT report) and involve experts from forensic account department as well as economic offences wing. If the SIT, after preliminary enquiry, finds commission of cognizable offence, it would register FIRs,"" the bench said.The court asked this SIT to submit a probe status report but clarified that excess compensation paid to landowners would not be recovered.","The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority.

Here are top observations of Supreme Court order



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has uploaded the full order in suo motu case on the stray dog issue, in which a two-judge bench on Monday, August 11, directed that stray dogs in Delhi-NCR be relocated to shelters.In the judgment, uploaded on the apex court's website on Wednesday, the Court has included directions to ensure that the dogs are not ill-treated in shelter homes while saying that the judiciary bears the sole responsibility to ""possess the courage and strength"" to remind people of truths that they may not prefer to hear.Meanwhile, in a related development, a new three-judge bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria will hear the matter on Thursday.The directions to permanently relocate all strays from streets to shelters ""at the earliest"" were passed by a bench comprising Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan on August 11.The bench passed a slew of directions while hearing a suo-motu case initiated on July 28 over stray-dog bites leading to rabies, particularly among children, in the national capital.""The judiciary must not assume or take on the colouration of the prevailing popular sentiments of the time, for its role is not to echo the passions of the moment but to uphold the enduring principles of justice, conscience and equity,"" the order said.""As the sentinel on the qui vive, a guardian of rights, the judiciary bears the solemn responsibility to possess the courage and the strength to remind the people of truths that they may not like or prefer not to hear,"" it added.The bench acknowledged the “genuine love and care” many people have for stray dogs and encouraged them to “come forward and become a part of this exercise,” taking responsibility for the care and upkeep of the animals in shelters or pounds.""In light of the concerns of the interveners, we urge all to adopt and give dogs a shelter in their homes. However, we do not ascribe to the virtue signalling of all those who share love and concern for the animals,"" the order noted.The court said it is mindful of and sensitive to the concept of coexistence, but stressed that coexistence should not mean one life existing at the cost of another.""As a court, our heart pains equally for everyone. We condemn those who, beneath the cloak of 'love and care' for the voiceless, pursue the warmth of self-congratulation. The directions given by us, as a court which functions for the welfare of the people, are both in the interest of humans as well as dogs. This is not personal,"" it added.""The exercise that we propose to undertake is not to be performed in a casual manner. The burning issue that we have embarked upon is not driven by a momentary impulse,"" the bench said.""On the contrary, it is only after the deepest of deliberations, and having reached the firm conclusion about the systematic failure of the concerned authorities over the past two decades to address an issue that strikes at the heart of public safety that we have decided to take the matter in our hands,"" it added.Noting the rising incidents of dog bites, the bench said this is not the time for resistance or hesitation stemming from complacency. It added that streets should not be places of vulnerability.""Among a bundle of concerns, we are at pains to take cognisance of the experiences of visually-impaired persons, young children, elderly persons, people from a humble background who are not able to afford even a day's meal, let alone the medical expenses. The visually-impaired persons are at the highest risk of dog bites as their primary support, their canes, are seen as threats by the dogs,"" it said.The bench also said there is no way one can identify or classify between a rabies-carrying dog and other dogs.""It is often said that 'no person is above the law'. However, of equal significance is the flip side of that maxim -- 'no person is below the law' either,"" it said.","The Supreme Court has uploaded the full order in suo motu case on the stray dog issue.

Poll Should India resume the Indus Waters Treaty despite ongoing disputes? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has welcomed an international court's ruling interpreting design criteria for new run-of-river hydropower projects on the Western Rivers (Chenab, Jhelum and Indus), to be built by India, saying it vindicates its position on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which India put in abeyance after the Pahalgam attack.India, however, has never recognised the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which reportedly ruled that India must ""let flow"" the waters of the Western Rivers for Pakistan's unrestricted use. India has instead focused on the neutral expert mechanism.""The specified exceptions for generation of hydro-electric plants must conform strictly to the requirements laid down in the treaty, rather than to what India might consider an 'ideal' or 'best practices' approach,"" Pakistan's foreign office said Monday.While India's official response is expected Wednesday, sources recalled it had earlier notified modification of IWT amid prolonged disputes over Kishanganga and Ratle projects in J&K. India never accepted World Bank's decision to simultaneously activate both neutral expert mechanism and, at Pakistan's insistence, Court of Arbitration on the same issues - the reason it sought reconsideration of the treaty's dispute resolution process.In Oct 2022, World Bank appointed both a neutral expert and a Court of Arbitration despite acknowledging India's concerns that concurrent proceedings posed practical and legal challenges.Following Monday's ruling, Pakistan reiterated its commitment to implementing IWT and urged India to resume functioning of the same. India maintains IWT will remain in abeyance until Pakistan takes action against cross-border terrorism.","Pakistan welcomes international court's ruling interpreting design criteria for new run-of-river hydropower projects on the Western Rivers.

So, Is It Bye-Bye America?

Three Things To Note For India

Just a year ago, it would perhaps have taken a big leap of faith for PM Narendra Modi to travel to China. The two countries’ relationship was still on ventilator. The border was relatively quiet, but disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh was still incomplete.Now, as Modi gets ready to visit Tianjin later this month, it seems the most unambivalent thing to do, grounded in a realistic understanding of global uncertainties and the need to reinforce its multialignment.It helps, of course, that the agreement Modi reached with President Xi Jinping on the margins of the Brics summit in Oct — that disputes and differences would not be allowed to disturb border peace — has remained unimpaired. While India’s official announcement is awaited, Modi’s visit is all but certain; so is Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s to India next week for talks with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar Granted, Modi’s visit is for a multilateral event: the summit meeting of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), a 10-member security-oriented Eurasian grouping dominated by China and Russia, seen as a potential counterweight to Nato. Modi’s last visit to China, in 2018, was also for the SCO summit.Given the state of its ties with China and Pakistan, India is a bit of an outlier in the group, as it doesn’t join others in endorsing initiatives like the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).In 2023, it also backed out of an economic roadmap as it seemed more aligned with Chinese interests. More recently, India also refused to sign on to a joint statement condemning Israel’s attack on Iran.However, India acknowledges SCO’s role in combating terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan, promoting connectivity that doesn’t undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity, and facilitating its own ties with Central Asia. Modi has used the SCO Heads of State Council meeting, the highest decision-making body of the organisation, to draw attention to cross-border terrorism, without naming Pakistan.SCO has also had an important role to play in bringing India and China together. Russia may not have actively mediated between India and China, but it has nudged both sides to use the forum to engage with each other after 2020’s Galwan clash.The Moscow Consensus, within three months of Galwan — on the margins of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in the Russian capital — to ease tensions is a case in point. President Xi Jinping in 2023 also participated in the SCO summit Modi hosted virtually under India’s presidency.However, Modi has also skipped SCO summit meetings. He missed one in Kazakhstan last year. If Modi is travelling to China, it’s because he understands the salience Xi has attached to the Tianjin summit under China’s presidency, prioritising it over Brics this year, and the need to normalise a relationship that he believes is important not just for India and China, but the entire world. Support from China will also be crucial for India’s Brics presidency next year.Trump’s foreign policy has wrongfooted India but, to be fair to the Indian govt, India and China started to rebuild ties long before the US president sent the world careening towards an apocalyptic trade war. In fact, the agreement to end the military standoff in eastern Ladakh happened even before the US presidential elections.By visiting China, Modi is signalling that India is ready to have a sound working relationship with Beijing — as long as border peace and tranquillity is not disturbed. When NSA Doval visited China last Dec, both sides agreed to maintain peace on the ground so that “issues on the border do not hold back the normal development of bilateral relations”.India has not allowed China’s military cooperation with Pakistan — even after Operation Sindoor — to ruin the Sino-Indian thaw, and Beijing was muted in its criticism of India’s first joint patrolling of the South China Sea with the Philippines, suggesting a readiness from both sides to take a long view of the relationship. Modi’s bilateral meeting with Xi, which might see important announcements (such as the resumption of direct flights), is an opportunity for both sides to rebuild trust for a mutually beneficial partnership in areas like trade, investment and emerging technologies, in which China is a global leader.India will expect China to reciprocate by addressing some of its trade restrictions related to manpower and equipment that impact Indian manufacturing, and deliver on the promise to import more to reduce the $100 billion trade deficit. India will also be mindful of China’s efforts to undercut its influence in the neighbourhood and the larger Indo-Pacific. China will expect, as ambassador Xu Feihong toldrecently, a transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for its companies.The dragon-elephant tango may have just started but, in these circumstances, it will remain accident-prone. The way the relationship has peaked and troughed from the initial Modi years to the Doklam crisis, and again from the excitement over the informal summits to the Galwan despair, serves as an important lesson. The answer probably lies in Modi’s recent remark, quickly endorsed by Beijing, that competition should not be allowed to turn into conflict.Not really. Modi has, in the past, attended several SCO summits where he has met Xi — and all it has signified is India’s strategic autonomy. His upcoming visit to China is drawing more attention because of the state of India’s ties with the US.India and the US seemed set to embark on a new phase in the relationship, based on robust and next-generation defence and technology collaborations, along with stronger energy ties, when Trump dropped his tariff bomb, doubling the levy on India for its oil imports from Russia.But it will probably take more than one individual, even if he’s the US president, to do any structural damage to a relationship successive American presidents have called one of the most defining partnerships of the 21st century.Amid calls for India to take on the Trump administration, the govt itself has chosen to avoid confrontation. Trump is known to take maximalist positions ahead of trade agreements, and India is still willing to negotiate. India’s statement that the relationship has weathered such challenges in the past has been received well by the US State Department. The visit to China registers India’s position against Western unilateralism, but India is not giving up on America yet. A possible return of peace in Ukraine can also wipe out half of India’s tariff woes.There are three things India will guard against, though. The first is whether Trump, chasing a watershed trade deal with China, will remain as committed to the Indo-Pacific as he was during his previous term, when he revived Quad. The tariff issue has cast a shadow on the upcoming Quad summit India has to host in early Nov. If Trump doesn’t come, there will be questions raised about the US’s long-standing policy of dealing with India as a country that can ensure a sustainable balance of power in the region. India’s efforts to restore ties with China help it hedge against this eventuality.Second is the strong counterterrorism cooperation that will likely be diluted by Trump’s remarkable turnaround on Pakistan — from accusing it of hoodwinking US presidents on the issue of terrorism to treating it as a lodestar in the fight against the menace. Re-hyphenating India with Pakistan can potentially cause irreparable damage to relations with India.Third is the impending H-1B overhaul, and the likely impact on Indian professionals in the IT and healthcare sectors. This is sure to ignite another diplomatic firestorm, damaging people-to-people contacts and what India sees as a mutually beneficial economic and technology partnership.All three are issues that will test India’s resolve and push the limits of Indian diplomacy.",PM Narendra Modi is set to visit Tianjin later this month for the SCO summit meeting. Modi is signalling that India is ready to have a sound working relationship with Beijing. Support from China will also be crucial for India’s Brics presidency next year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123292405,imgsize-596051,width-400,resizemode-4/123292405.jpg"

NEW DELHI: ED has arrested Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.The arrest followed a police case registered in Mohali, with the probe agency conducting raids on Tuesday and Wednesday at multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai, ED said in a press release.The agency said it found that Virk, who acted in movies and claims to be a cosmetologist, was in regular touch with Angarai Natarajan Sethuraman, a former director of Reliance Capital, which was part of the Anil Ambani group.The ED statement alleged Virk had been communicating with Sethuraman regarding illegal liaising work. It added that this was also confirmed during searches at the residence of Sethuraman, who was a prominent member of the business group's corporate affairs team in Delhi.When contacted, Sethuraman said, ""These allegations are entirely baseless"" and that he had no connection or involvement with Virk or any transactions related to her.In a release, ED said, ""Besides, diversion of funds for personal benefit has been unearthed during course of search. In 2018, public money of Rs 18 crore approx belonging to Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd was disbursed to Sethuraman by flouting prudent lending norms.The funds were lent under terms that allowed deferment of principal as well as interest, with multiple waivers granted & no due diligence conducted. Besides, home loan of Rs 22 crore was provided by Reliance Capital Limited by violating the prudential norms. Large part of these loans are seen to have been eventually siphoned off and remained unpaid.""Sethuraman said that the home loan he received from Reliance Capital was granted following due process and was secured by the property offered as collateral.Following her arrest, Virk was produced before a special court here on Wednesday, which remanded her to ED custody till Aug 14. Virk's arrest came after searches conducted by the agency in Delhi and Mumbai on her premises and those of her close associates,She is accused of impersonating officers of law enforcement agencies, duping individuals, and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud against complainant Jasneet Kaur, under the pretext of investment in a film project. The main accused in the fraud, Amit Gupta alias Nageshwar Gupta, was declared a proclaimed offender in Oct 2024.The agency claimed during its searches, it seized ""incriminating documents"" and records, and statements of key persons and associates, including Farrukh Ali, were recorded. ED said its current searches were part of an ongoing investigation into charges against Virk and her associates, who are alleged to have ""exerted undue influence through misrepresentation and defrauded individuals by soliciting money under false promises"".""Virk has acquired immovable property in her name by making false promises and cheating. She claims to be owner of hyboocare.com, a website purportedly selling FDA-approved beauty products. However, the products listed on the site have been found to be non-existent,"" the agency said. It added that its probe revealed that the website floated by Virk lacked basics, such as user registration options. Scrutiny of the website uncovered minimal social media engagement, an inactive WhatsApp contact number, and absence of transparent organisational details, all of which reinforce suspicion of non-genuine commercial activity, ED said.","Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod to a strict Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which provides for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment and fine of up to Rs 10 lakh for ""forced conversion"". The govt is likely to table the bill in the House, where they have a strong majority, for approval during the three-day monsoon session of assembly commencing on Aug 19.At present, the maximum jail term for such an offence is 10 years and the highest fine is Rs 50,000. The new bill proposes to raise the jail term to 14 years, and, in some cases, to 20 years which may even extend to life imprisonment. Arrests can be made without a warrant and the DM can seize properties acquired through crimes related to conversion.CM Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI on Wednesday hours after the cabinet decision: ""Uttarakhand is Devbhoomi (the land of Gods) and a place where holy saints through the ages came and meditated. In the last few years, there have been instances of demographic changes under the guise of illegal conversions. The proposed amendment is a major step on our part to ensure that the social fabric of the Himalayan state is not changed.Therefore, we have come up with stringent measures to check the illegal practice.""According to the cabinet's proposal, ""Whoever receives funds from foreign or (other) entities concerning unlawful religious conversion shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than seven years and which may extend up to 14 years, and shall also be liable to a fine not less than Rs 10 lakh."" It further states, ""Whoever, with the intent to convert, instils fear for life or property, assaults or uses force, promises marriage or incites or conspires for such conversion, or traffics a minor woman or person or otherwise sells them, or attempts or conspires for this purpose, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 20 years and which may extend to life imprisonment, meaning imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, and shall also be liable to a fine. ""As per the new provisions, concealing religion for marriage is a crime, and offenders could face three to 10 years in prison and a fine of Rs 3 lakh. On ""mass conversion"", the document says it will attract imprisonment of not less than seven years and up to 14 years, and shall be liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh.Concerning ""a minor, woman or a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, or a disabled or mentally challenged person"", the punishment shall be imprisonment not less than five years, which may extend up to 14 years and liable to a fine not less than Rs 1 lakh. For general cases, the jail term would range from three years to 10 years and a fine of Rs 50,000.All offences under the new provisions shall be cognizable and non-bailable and triable by a sessions court. Arrests can be made without a warrant and bail will only be granted if the court is convinced the accused is not guilty and will not repeat the offence. As per the proposal, if any property is acquired through crimes related to conversion, the DM can seize it.The provision mentions: ""If the DM has reason to believe that any property in possession of a person, whether movable or immovable, was acquired as a result of an offence under this Act, they may order the seizure of such property, regardless of whether a court has taken cognisance of such offence.""Provisions of the Indian Civil Protection Code shall apply to every such seizure, with necessary modifications. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Code, the district magistrate may appoint an administrator for any property seized under subsection (1) and the administrator shall have all powers to manage it in the best interest of such property. The district magistrate may arrange for police assistance for the proper and effective management of such property by the administrator. ""The amendment has also redefined ""inducement"", which now means and includes offering any of the following: ""Any gift, gratification, easy money, or material benefit in cash or kind. Employment, free education in a school or college run by a religious institution, or a promise to marry or a better lifestyle, divine displeasure or otherwise. Portraying the practices, rituals and ceremonies of one religion in a harmful manner concerning another religion, or glorifying one religion against another.

NEW DELHI: In a significant decision coming two days after Justice J B Pardiwala-led two-judge bench's controversial order for removal of all stray dogs from Delhi and NCR streets, Chief Justice B R Gavai Wednesday withdrew the case from that bench and posted it for rehearing on Thursday before a three-judge special bench led by Justice Vikram Nath.In the much-criticised Aug 11 order, Justices Pardiwala and R Mahadevan had directed Delhi and NCR civic authorities to ""start picking up and rounding up stray dogs from all localities of Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Faridabad, Gurgaon as well as areas on the outskirts, and relocate these dogs to designated shelters/pounds.""Prompted by pleas from two counsel - one of whom pointed to the order's apparent conflict with a previous judgment of another apex court bench - and the excoriating criticism of SC by animal lovers, activists and the public, CJI Gavai moved speedily to withdraw the matter from Justice Pardiwala's bench and assign it to Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria.On May 9, 2024, a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Sanjay Karol had passed an elaborate order disposing of two dozen petitions filed by Kerala, Animal Welfare Board, NGOs and animal lovers appealing against conflicting high court orders on removal of stray dogs.On Wednesday morning, a counsel had mentioned before the CJI that the Aug 11 order was in conflict with last year's SC judgment, which had ordered civic bodies to act with compassion and strictly inaccordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023, while dealing with stray dogs.Another counsel appeared before the CJI at 4 pm and complained that while the Aug 11 order was not yet available, authorities had begun implementing it.In their 2024 judgment, the bench of Justices Maheshwari and Karol had said, ""Under all circumstances, there cannot be any indiscriminate killings of canines, and authorities have to take action in terms of the mandate and spirit of the prevalent legislation(s) in place. There is no gainsaying the fact that exhibiting compassion to all living beings is the enshrined constitutional value and mandate and casts obligation on the authorities to maintain it.

Bid that bagged the 12 Earth Observation satellites PPP Project quoted Rs 0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bid-that-bagged-the-12-earth-observation-satellites-ppp-project-quoted-rs-0/articleshow/123291019.cms,"BENGALURU: In what’s unprecedented, the L1 quotation (lowest bid) by the consortium that won the 12 Earth Observation satellites project being implemented as a PPP by IN-SPACe, is Rs 0 (zero rupees). The consortium comprising Pixxel, PierSight, SatSure and Dhruva, which will bear the financial cost of the project, will invest more than Rs 1,2000 crore in the next four-five years.Confirming this, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka told TOI in a one-on-one interaction: “Obviously this was a competitive bid and each of the bidders would have evaluated the value of giving the opportunity to build this constellation. In the judgment of the winning bidder, they decided that even if they don’t get any money from the govt, it is important for them to get this opportunity to develop it and therefore they see a good financial opportunity in this constellation. ”Terming it a very big endorsement of how the private sector sees the future of space economy in India, he said: “...for a consortium to come forward and commit to invest more than Rs 1,200 crores of their own money with a full expectation, obviously, that they will more than recover their investment over a period of time.So I think it’s very, very positive news that the winning bidder has bid only zero.”As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the constellation of 12 satellites will feature a mix of sub-metre very high-resolution, wide-swath multispectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and hyperspectral satellites, enabling applications such as precision agriculture, water quality monitoring, land-use mapping, environmental compliance, disaster assessment, maritime operations, national security and infrastructure development.The project will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). “We have a time limit of 90 days for signing the agreement starting yesterday. Hopefully we sign much before that. As per the RFP, the lead player must have at least 26% ownership and each consortium member at least 10%. It will be a legal entity formed with well-defined roles for each of the four members.”SatSure CEO Prateep Basu said: “SatSure will be contributing two satellites in this consortium, with its novel optical and multi-spectral wide swath imager developed by its subsidiary KaleidEO. We’ll be commercialising our novel payload that provides high coverage at sub-meter spatial resolution. I believe this is a milestone not just for India’s space story, but for how EO technology can deliver meaningful, measurable value to users across different industries. ”PierSight will be producing at least two, if not three SAR satellites, while the remaining will be hyperspectral satellites from Pixxel’s stable. “SAR makes the constellation operational 24/7 in all weather conditions. Our role is to deliver radar‐first, analysis‐ready products with low latency, so agencies and enterprises get alerts and evidence, not just raw data,” PierSight CEO Gaurav Seth, said.Dhruva Space CEO Sanjay Nekkanti said the project reflects growing confidence in India’s private space tech sector. The company plans to leverage its upcoming spacecraft manufacturing facility in Telangana to scale production and offer turnkey ground station infrastructure. In partnership with consortium members, Dhruva aims to build an end-to-end, sovereign EO ecosystem.Goenka said IN-SPACe was very happy with the outcome, and added that when they started, the agency didn’t know whether there will be enough interest in the private sector to take on a project of this nature, because this is one of the largest investments made by the private sector in the space sector.“...Finally, to have three people qualify for the commercial bid, each wanting the project very, very badly, gives us confidence that there is tremendous optimism about the space sector opportunities in the private sector… It is a validation of the whole space sector reform,” he said.","In what’s unprecedented, the L1 quotation (lowest bid) by the consortium that won the 12 Earth Observation satellites project is Rs 0.

PANAJI: In a move aimed at giving people greater access to high-cost medical treatment for cancer and rare diseases, Goa rolled out an innovative pricing policy for life-saving therapies.Under the policy, the state govt will procure drugs, medical equipment, and diagnostics from pharmaceutical firms at a lower negotiated price from the listed price, enabling budget allocation to cater to more patients or support a longer duration for therapies.Vishwajit Rane, health minister, said on Wednesday the govt is the first in the country to adopt this policy framework, which enables confidential pricing agreements between govt and pharmaceutical innovators. The rollout is likely to begin with lung cancer treatment.Innovative therapies for diseases like cancer, rare genetic disorders, and autoimmune conditions can cost upwards of Rs 50 lakh per year, making them difficult for most patients, he said.""Goa's adoption of this pricing policy is a vital and timely step to advance health equity in the state. This value-based approach to pricing will improve access for patients and marks a new era focusing on helping more patients,"" Rane said.This new innovation will prove beneficial to Goa, which is in the upper quartile of the list of highest cancer incidence rates in the country. The state sees around 1,500 new cancer patients every year, which is set to increase by 5% each year, with the most common cancer being breast cancer, accounting for over 300 annual cases, followed by oral cavity cancer, which accounts for 20-25% of all cancers.The healthcare system must be better equipped to handle the growing burden of cancers and rare disease cases, Rane said.A committee chaired by the additional or joint secretary of health and comprising the dean of GMC, director of health services, and pharmacy heads will be constituted to recommend appropriate pricing for approval by govt. The committee will also be empowered to negotiate with firms to secure the best rate for patented drugs and equipment after signing agreements.","State govt will procure drugs, medical equipment, and diagnostics from pharmaceutical firms at a lower negotiated price.

Lab-grown rabies antibodies show promise as safe alternative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lab-grown-rabies-antibodies-show-promise-as-safe-alternative/articleshow/123290787.cms,"MUMBAI: India's public hospitals and dispensaries may soon have a safer, more affordable option for preventing rabies after a suspected rabid dog bite: one already in use in private clinics since 2017 and by BMC since 2019. A post-marketing clinical trial involving more than 4,000 participants, conducted and funded by a pharmaceutical company and recently published in The Lancet, could now pave the way for its large-scale public use. For decades, the life-saving protocol has been the same across public or private health set ups: wash the wound, inject a dose of rabies immunoglobulin if the bite is severe, and follow with multiple doses of anti-rabies vaccine. The possible shift lies in the kind of immunoglobulin used. The relatively new lab-made candidate could replace the animal and human derived versions in use since the 1970s.An immunoglobulin is a concentrated solution of antibodies, injected directly into and around the bite, that offers immediate but short-term protection against the virus, effectively buying time until the vaccine takes full effect. The earliest ones in use were derived either from rabies-vaccinated horses (Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin - ERIG) or human donated plasma (Human Rabies Immunoglobulin - HRIG). In 2016, Serum Institute of India (SII) received permission to make immunoglobulin which has monoclonal (lab-made,RmAb) antibodies.""Most private facilities at least in Mumbai have phased out the use of the horse-derived one. While it has been proven safe at large, there are risks associated; it can cause mild allergic reactions or in rare cases a serious adverse event,"" said Dr Trupti Gilada, city-based infectious disease specialist. The private facilities have moved on to either the human derived or lab-made ones. ""Both, human derived one and the lab-made one have high efficacy. The former has risk of infection transmission, though rare. The ones made in labs are safer and more easily available due to ease of largescale production,"" said Dr Mandar Kubal, another infectious disease specialist.A survey by ICMR published in July on the availability of anti-rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin in health facilities found that, of the 534 facilities surveyed across 15 states and 60 districts -- 467 in the public sector -- 78% still used horse derived immunoglobulin. But even that was out of stock for most apart from a small 20.3% of those surveyed. While BMC uses the lab-made alternative, it is no stranger to shortages; at the moment it is short of rabies vaccine shots.A doctor from one of the four BMC-run medical college hospitals, said, ""Mumbai has a heavy burden of dog bite cases and early on BMC decided to move on from animal derived ones due to risks associated. We either use generic human derived immunoglobulin or largely lab-made alternatives."" But this lab-made alternative is still to make its way into National Guidelines for Rabies Prophylaxis. The ICMR survey states, ""RmAb presents as a promising alternative to both HRIG and ERIG. Compared to ERIG, RmAb offers the potential scope for large-scale production with standardised quality, elimination of animal use in the manufacturing, & reduced risk of adverse events.""It is cheaper compared to HRIG. Studies have shown that RmAbs are safe for human use, but... [there is] a need for larger clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance to assess the safety and efficacy of RmAbs in the Indian setting."" The Serum Institute-funded post marketing trial of its lab-made product compared with horse-derived immunoglobulin found to be equally effective in preventing rabies, with slightly higher average antibody levels on day 14.","India's public hospitals and dispensaries may soon have a safer, more affordable option for preventing rabies after a suspected rabid dog bite. A post-marketing clinical trial involving more than 4,000 participants, conducted and funded by a pharmaceutical company, could pave the way for its large-scale public use. For decades, the life-saving protocol has been the same across public or private health set ups.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123290825,imgsize-1375861,width-400,resizemode-4/123290825.jpg"
Parliamentary panel slams 'perpetual tolling' on national highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliamentary-panel-slams-perpetual-tolling-on-national-highways/articleshow/123290670.cms,"NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel looking into the levy of user fees or toll charges on National Highways (NHs) has raised concerns over the current practice of ""perpetual tolling"" even after project costs are recovered and a 3% annual escalation, irrespective of the highway quality, traffic volume, or user affordability.While recommending rationalisation and substantial reduction in toll charges on such stretches, its report has also mooted a ""tariff authority"" for toll fixation. The Public Accounts Committee headed by Congress MP K C Venugopal said, ""Any continuation of tolls beyond this point should be permitted only if clearly justified and approved by the proposed independent oversight authority"". It said the road transport ministry can establish the authority on the lines of the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) in the civil aviation sector, to ensure transparency and fairness in toll fixation, collection, and regulation. The report added that the authority should be mandated to review and determine the periodicity of toll revisions based on certain parameters.In response to the PAC's observation that there is no institutional mechanism to independently evaluate whether toll charges are justified in relation to actual operation and maintenance costs or future service requirements, the ministry said it has initiated a study with NITI Aayog to revise the user fees determination framework, including base rates, inflation indexing, and concession structures.As per the report, the ministry told PAC that it has requested NITI Aayog to carry out a study in association with IITs and IIMs.The panel has also sought review of all existing contracts and publicly funded toll plazas allowing tolling beyond the cost recovery period, to safeguard user interest and uphold the principle of equity. It said that while higher toll charges are justified during the period of concession agreement, their collection after that needs to be justified.","A parliamentary panel looking into the levy of user fees or toll charges on National Highways has raised concerns over the current practice of ""perpetual tolling"" The Public Accounts Committee headed by Congress MP K C Venugopal said, ""Any continuation of tolls beyond this point should be permitted only if clearly justified and approved""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123290686,imgsize-813993,width-400,resizemode-4/123290686.jpg"

Is the Boston Celtics up for sale?



Boston Celtics’ valuation went from $360 Million to $6.1 Billion



Jayson Tatum’s team, the Boston Celtics, just received the league’s official green light for a record-setting sale. The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the $6.1 billion purchase of the team by an investor group led by Massachusetts native Bill Chisholm. The transaction, first agreed to in March, is expected to close soon, marking one of the most expensive deals in U.S. sports history.When Boston Basketball Partners LLC announced plans to sell the franchise in July, the deal was set to unfold in two phases, with current CEO and governor Wyc Grousbeck staying in charge through the 2027–28 season. But under NBA ownership rules, governors must hold at least a 15% stake. Since Grousbeck’s share will fall below that threshold, Chisholm will now assume the governor's role immediately.Despite the change, ESPN reports both men “plan to run the team together as originally planned.” The investor group also features current Celtics co-owner Rob Hale, Related Companies president Bruce Beal Jr., and Sixth Street Partners. BDT & MSD Partners, J.P. Morgan, and the Jordan Park Group advised the sellers, while Goldman Sachs represented the buyers. Legal counsel came from Cooley LLP for the Grousbeck family and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz for the Chisholm-led group.Chisholm, co-founder and managing partner of Symphony Technology Group, has a track record of steering major investments across software, security, and data services. Calling himself a “die-hard Celtics fan,” he beat out at least two rival bids, including one from former Celtics minority partner Steve Pagliuca.The Grousbeck family, along with Steve Pagliuca, bought the Celtics in 2002 for $360 million. Under their stewardship, the team captured two NBA titles in 2008 and 2024, pushing their championship tally to a record 18. The franchise’s value has soared, fueled by the NBA’s booming media rights market.When the deal closes, Chisholm’s group will control at least 51% of the Celtics, with full ownership expected by 2028. The final price could reach $7.3 billion — eclipsing the $6.05 billion paid for the NFL’s Washington Commanders and the $4 billion valuation of the Phoenix Suns in 2023. The only higher North American sports sale came earlier this year when the Los Angeles Lakers sold for $10 billion.Also Read: Indiana Fever survive mid-game drama as Caitlin Clark prevents enraged coach from earning technical foul Boston’s on-court success comes with off-court challenges.

Still, with Jayson Tatum leading a championship-caliber roster and a high-profile ownership group at the helm, the Celtics enter the next chapter of their storied history with record-breaking momentum.","The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the $6.1 billion purchase of the team by an investor group led by Massachusetts native Bill Chisholm.

What is La La Anthony’s net worth in 2025?

The NBA world extends beyond the confines of the court, where there is a huge focus on the women who are firmly beside the basketball icons. Two of those top women in 2025 are Vanessa Bryant and La La Anthony. Apart from being the wives of legendary players, Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony, respectively, they have built their own fortune with resilience and persistence, so it is interesting to see who leads the charge in terms of net worth.Vanessa Bryant is the widow of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, who passed away in a tragic helicopter crash in 2020.

According to Celebrity Net Worth, her financial standing as of now is estimated to be $600 million.The majority of the wealth came from the inheritance of Kobe Bryant’s estate, including paychecks from the NBA, investments, and endorsement deals with brands like McDonald's and Nike. One of the top investments that fetched major returns was in Body Armor. After Coca-Cola purchased it for $5.6 billion, Vanessa’s earnings shot up to $400 million alone from that one deal, while legal settlements from deals also added another $28 million to her fortune.Apart from these, Vanessa runs the Granity Studios as President and CEO, producing content to honor Kobe Bryant’s legacy, and also launched the Mambacita clothing line, which supports young players through her foundation, Mambacita Sports Foundation.

Indian economy outlook: Morgan Stanley sees India emerging as top consumer market; energy transition and manufacturing boost ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-economy-outlook-morgan-stanley-sees-india-emerging-as-top-consumer-market-energy-transition-and-manufacturing-boost-ahead/articleshow/123286253.cms,"India is on track to become the world’s most sought-after consumer market while undergoing a major energy transition, witnessing a rise in the credit-to-GDP ratio, and seeing manufacturing take a bigger share of GDP, according to a Morgan Stanley report.The report noted that the falling intensity of oil in GDP, a rising share of exports—particularly services—and fiscal consolidation with a likely primary surplus in three years will help reduce the saving imbalance. This, it said, would enable structurally lower real interest rates in the economy, according to an ANI report quoting Morgan Stanley.“India will become the world’s most sought-after consumer market,” the report stated, adding that lower inflation volatility, driven by supply-side improvements and policy changes such as flexible inflation targeting, will also reduce fluctuations in interest rates and growth rates in the coming years.High growth combined with low volatility, falling interest rates, and a low beta could lead to higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, the report said. This environment would support a structural shift in household balance sheets towards equities, already evident in sustained buying in the stock market.The low beta, it added, is underpinned by improved macroeconomic stability and household portfolio diversification.It also pointed out that current market performance hides the extent to which stocks have de-rated relative to long bonds and gold, even as India gains share in global GDP.Morgan Stanley observed that the soft patch in earnings growth that began in Q2 FY2025 now appears to be ending, although the market may not yet be fully convinced. A dovish central bank stance is aiding a turnaround in growth, but greater clarity on the external environment and rationalisation of GST rates may be needed to strengthen sentiment.It said catalysts for further growth could include a final trade deal with the US, new capital expenditure announcements, an acceleration in loans—already visible in the corporate bond market—uniform improvement in high-frequency economic indicators, and stronger trade ties with China.","India is on track to become the world’s most sought-after consumer market while undergoing a major energy transition. The falling intensity of oil in GDP, a rising share of exports and fiscal consolidation with a likely primary surplus in three years will help reduce the saving imbalance. This, it said, would enable structurally lower real interest rates in the economy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123286264,imgsize-757285,width-400,resizemode-4/123286264.jpg"

Following valuable feedback from our customers, we have revised these requirements to better reflect their expectations and preferences.”MAB is calculated as the simple average of day-end balances in a calendar month.The earlier announcement, made last weekend, had sharply increased MAB for new savings accounts from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 in metro and urban branches, from Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 in semi-urban branches, and from Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000 in rural branches.Customers failing to meet the MAB would have been charged 6% of the shortfall or Rs 500, whichever was lower.After the announcement, many bankers were mystified by ICICI Bank's move, which they said prima facie appeared aimed at filtering out low-value customers.The bank statement continued that, “transactions at ICICI Bank ATMs (cash withdrawals) Rs 23 per financial transaction, post 5 transactions. All non-financial transactions are free.

Trump vs Harvard: University nears $500M settlement to restore federal fundings; resolve months-long feud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-harvard-university-nears-500m-settlement-to-restore-federal-fundings-resolve-months-long-feud/articleshow/123287009.cms,"Harvard Defiant Despite Trump Visa Ban, Vows To Protect Global Students | 'Illegal Retaliation'





Harvard University and the Trump administration are close to reaching a deal that would require the Ivy League school to pay $500 million in order to regain access to federal funding and end ongoing investigations, according to media reports.The settlement framework is still being negotiated, with some details yet to be resolved, but both sides have agreed on the payment amount. A final agreement could be reached within weeks, as reported by the Associated Press.The potential deal would end a months-long dispute that began as an investigation into antisemitism on campus but quickly escalated into a broader clash. The Trump administration cut more than $2.6 billion in research funding, canceled federal contracts, and attempted to block Harvard from hosting international students.Harvard responded by filing two lawsuits accusing the administration of unlawful retaliation, claiming the government’s demands threatened academic freedom.A $500 million payment would be the largest financial settlement sought by the administration in its recent actions against elite universities. Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million to restore federal funding, while Brown University reached a $50 million settlement benefiting Rhode Island workforce programs.President Trump has made reshaping prestigious universities a political priority, often criticizing them as centers of liberal ideology.

India’s crude oil trade with Russia

Bessent wants Europe to ‘put up or shut up’

The Donald Trump administration has warned of higher secondary tariffs on India if the talks between the US President and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin don’t go well in Alaska on Friday. India at present faces a total 50% US tariffs for its exports to America.US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% base line tariff on India and an additional 25% tariff for the latter’s crude oil trade with Russia. Experts widely believe that the 25% additional tariffs for crude oil trade are a pressure tactic to get Putin to stop the Russia-Ukraine war. India and China are the two largest buyers of Russian crude oil in the world.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in an interview with Bloomberg TV said, “We put secondary tariffs on the Indians for buying Russian oil. And I could see if things don’t go well, then sanctions or secondary tariffs could go up.”Bessent mentioned that sanctions on Russia could either be intensified or relaxed, depending on the outcome of a meeting scheduled for Friday between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin.India ranks as the third-largest oil consumer globally and has notably increased its purchase of Russian crude oil since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began, largely due to the substantial discounts available.However, Trump's decision to double tariffs on Indian imports, intended to penalize India's ongoing acquisition of Russian oil, poses difficulties for the country and its refining industry.Trump has demanded that India cease buying discounted Russian oil, arguing that it is ""fueling the war machine"" in the Ukraine conflict.The 25% secondary tariff on India's crude oil trade with Russia is set to be implemented on August 27. Experts suggest that the 21-day window allows for potential negotiations between India and the US.Historically, India's crude oil imports from Russia were minimal, with a primary dependence on Middle Eastern sources. However, this changed in 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the G7's introduction of a $60-per-barrel price cap, aimed at limiting Russian oil income while ensuring a steady global supply.India on its part has strongly opposed the US secondary tariffs. In a statement after Trump’s announcement, the ministry of external affairs said, “The United States has in recent days targeted India’s oil imports from Russia. We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India. ”“It is therefore extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest. We reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable. India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interests,” the MEA statement said.Meanwhile, Bessent has also warned the European Union to either be ready to impose secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia, like China, or not speak up about how Trump should look to resolve the Russia-Ukraine matter.Regardless of the meeting's outcome, Bessent emphasized the importance of European support for stricter measures. ""The Europeans need to join us in these sanctions,"" he said to Bloomberg.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, European nations, Japan, and other countries have imposed numerous sanctions on Russia. In July, the European Union introduced its 18th sanctions package against Russia, targeting Russian energy.“It’s put up or shut up time,” Bessent said. He expressed disappointment over the lukewarm reception he received when he proposed this idea at a Group of Seven meeting earlier this year.“I was at the G7 meeting in Canada with President Trump and the Europeans kept talking about Senator Graham's bill to do the secondary tariffs. And I looked at all the leaders around the table, and I said, is everyone at this table willing to put a 200% tariff secondary tariff on China. And you know what, everybody wanted to see what kind of shoes they were wearing,” he said.Bessent also stated that Trump intends to communicate to President Putin that every possible course of action is being considered.","US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% base line tariff on India and an additional 25% tariff for the latter’s crude oil trade with Russia.

Market outlook and broader effects

Apple’s next iPhone release, the iPhone 17 series , could mark a notable shift—for the first time in years, consumers may see higher prices at launch. Analyst Jeff Pu from GF Securities reports that US tariffs on devices from China and India could push prices up by $50 to $100 compared to the iPhone 16 models. At the same time, Apple may increase the base storage on the Pro model to 256GB, adding more value behind the higher price. As September approaches, buyers and analysts are watching closely. The coming decisions will influence not only budgets but also the broader discussion around trade, manufacturing, and consumer expectations in the tech world.According to MacRumors, market projections suggest that at least some iPhone 17 models will cost between $50 and $100 more than their predecessors. This would be the first price increase for the Pro model since the iPhone X in 2017.One way Apple may lessen the sting is by increasing the minimum storage on the Pro model from 128GB to 256GB. This aligns with existing practices and can help justify a higher base price with a tangible upgrade.According to Jeff Pu, new US tariffs on products imported from iPhone assembly hubs like China and India are expected to raise production costs. While imports from China carry a 20% tariff, devices made in India are currently exempt. However, since Apple now brings most of its US-sold iPhones from India, these cost pressures still affect pricing decisions. The unpredictable nature of US trade policy adds another layer of uncertainty to Apple’s cost structure. Still, Apple fans remain eager to see what innovations the new iPhone 17 will bring despite potential price changes.Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup, including standard, Pro, Pro Max, and possibly an “Air” or “Slim” model, on September 9, 2025. Pre-orders may begin on September 12, with shipments and retail availability starting September 19.Potential starting prices based on recent leaks:According to Business Insider, Apple’s Q3 earnings report revealed $94 billion in revenue, supported by strong iPhone sales. Despite this, the company incurred $800 million in tariff costs, expected to rise to $1.1 billion next quarter. Analysts warn that continued cost challenges may force Apple to raise prices more broadly, not just in the US, potentially affecting global retail pricing strategies.","Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup, including standard, Pro, Pro Max, and possibly an “Air” or “Slim” model, on September 9, 2025.

Generative AI adoption surge: Banking sector set for efficiency leap by nearly 46%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/generative-ai-adoption-surge-banking-sector-set-for-efficiency-leap-by-nearly-46-rbi-report/articleshow/123294610.cms,"AI image

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) could enhance banking operations in India by as much as 46%, according to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report.As per news agency ANI, the central bank said AI could help financial institutions better understand customers, operate more efficiently, and deliver personalised services at scale.“GenAI is poised to improve banking operations in India by up to 46 per cent,” the RBI noted in its assessment, highlighting that AI adoption in financial services is accelerating to meet varied needs such as enhancing customer experience, improving employee productivity, increasing revenue, cutting costs, ensuring compliance, and driving innovation.As per the report, Generative AI is emerging as a game-changer, using advanced analytics to interpret customer behaviour, strengthen risk management, and streamline expenses. It also pointed to AI-powered alternative credit scoring models that are widening access to credit for people underserved by conventional banking systems.In India, where millions remain outside the formal banking network, AI can assess creditworthiness using non-traditional data sources such as utility payments, mobile usage, GST records, and e-commerce transactions. The RBI observed that this technology can help integrate “thin-file” or “new-to-credit” customers into the system.The report also highlighted the growing role of AI chatbots, which are transforming customer service by handling routine queries round the clock, resolving issues faster, and freeing up human staff for more complex cases.On a global scale, the use of AI in financial services is expanding rapidly. The RBI estimated that the generative AI market could surpass Rs 1.02 lakh crore (about $12 billion) by 2033, with an annual growth rate of 28–34%.It added that, when applied responsibly, AI can make banking more inclusive, efficient and customer-friendly, while fuelling long-term sector growth.","Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) could enhance banking operations in India by as much as 46%, according to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report.

Almost 20,000 people in western Canada were on standby on Wednesday as a wildfire swept across Mount Underwood, overlooking the city of Port Alberni. Authorities say the blaze is “out of control” and could spread further.Wildfires are also threatening other parts of the country. In Newfoundland and Labrador, parts of the capital St. John’s were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday after fires intensified. In Nova Scotia, a blaze was burning on the outskirts of Halifax, home to nearly half a million people.As of Wednesday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across Canada, including 161 out of control. Smoke has triggered air quality alerts for tens of millions in Canada and the US, and has travelled across the Atlantic, reaching parts of western Europe.This year is already Canada’s second-worst wildfire season since records began in 1983, with 7.4 million hectares burned, an area nearly as large as Panama. The worst was in 2023, when 17.3 million hectares were destroyed.Experts say climate change is increasing the risk of fires, with higher temperatures, reduced snow, shorter winters, and earlier summers. Fires along the coast, once rare, are now being reported more often.","As of Wednesday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across Canada, including 161 out of control.
