A new opportunity for Indian graduates

Poll Will Investment-Based Visa Programs Boost Global Economic Ties? No Yes

Trump wants to offer wealthy immigrants ‘gold cards’ for $5 million

Gold card to replace current visa system

US President Donald Trump has announced a new visa program that will offer a ""gold card"" with a potential pathway to US citizenship for $5 million, that could significantly benefit Indian graduates and investors. This initiative, which Trump expects to generate significant revenue, is set to replace the existing EB-5 visa program.Speaking about the program at his first cabinet meeting of his second term on Thursday, Trump said that the new program would allow American companies to hire Indian graduates from US universities. He highlighted how current immigration policies have prevented skilled professionals, particularly from India, from staying in the country after completing their education.Also read: Donald Trump plays gold card to US citizenship to entice the world's wealthy ""A person comes from India, China, Japan, lots of different places, and they go to Harvard, the Wharton School of Finance... they are made job offers, but the offer is immediately rescinded because you have no idea whether that person can stay in the country,"" Trump said.He acknowledged that many of these graduates return to their home countries and become successful entrepreneurs. ""They go back to India, or they go back to the country where they came from, and they open up a company, and they become billionaires. They're employing thousands of people,"" he said, pointing out the economic loss for the US.""We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,"" Trump added.Many countries around the world have citizenship or residency-by-investment programs. In Europe, countries like Portugal offer ""golden visas,"" granting permanent residency to foreigners who invest at least €500,000 ($524,000) in a qualifying fund.Trump sees the gold card visa as a potential source of income for the US. ""If we sell a million, that’s $5 trillion dollars,"" he said, adding that the revenue could help reduce national debt.Also read: Trump’s gold card visa scheme likely to impact Indians planning to apply for green cards through EB-5 route The program will replace the EB-5 visa, which currently grants residency to investors who invest at least $1 million in businesses that create jobs. Trump believes the gold card will attract wealthy individuals who will contribute to the US economy.""They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it's going to be extremely successful,"" he said.Trump expressed confidence in the demand for the new visa, saying, ""I happen to think it’ll sell like crazy. It’s a market. But we’ll know very soon.""Congress, meanwhile, determines qualifications for US citizenship, but the president said ""gold cards"" would not require congressional approval.US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who was also present at the meeting, said the gold card visa program would replace the current visa system for foreign investors but did not provide many details.He confirmed that the initiative would take the place of the EB-5 visa, which grants permanent residency to foreign investors who invest around $1 million and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US.Also read: Trump’s $5 million 'gold card' visa: What it means for Indians stuck in green card backlogs Lutnick criticized the EB-5 program, calling it ""poorly overseen and poorly executed,"" and said the new gold visa system would be a better alternative.""We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,"" he said about future gold card applicants.It remains unclear how recipients would be selected, whether there would be any restrictions, or if a limit would be set on the number of visas issued.In the fiscal year 2024, the State Department issued more than 12,000 EB-5 visas, marking a record high for the program.","US President Donald Trump has announced a new visa program that will offer a ""gold card"" with a potential pathway to US citizenship for $5 million.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday strongly criticised Pakistan at the 58th Session of the UN human rights council, calling it a ""failed state that thrives on instability and survives on international handouts.""Indian diplomat Kshitij Tyagi delivered a scathing response, accusing Pakistan of spreading falsehoods and using the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) as a ""mouthpiece"" to push its agenda against India.""It is regrettable to see Pakistan's leaders and delegates continuing to spread falsehoods handed down by its military-terrorist complex. Pakistan is making a mockery of the OIC by abusing it as its mouthpiece. It is unfortunate that this Council's time continues to be wasted by a failed state which thrives on instability and survives on international handouts. Its rhetoric reeks of hypocrisy, its actions of inhumanity, and its governance of incompetence. India remains focused on democracy, progress, and ensuring dignity for its people.

48hr deadline set to trace missing SLBC workers in collapsed tunnel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/48hr-deadline-set-to-trace-missing-slbc-workers-in-collapsed-tunnel/articleshow/118589371.cms,"HYDERABAD: Telangana's govt set a two-day deadline from Wednesday evening for the team of experts working to trace the eight workers buried under the collapsed Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel since Feb 22.""We have not lost hope and are working in the belief that they (the workers) are still alive,"" said Telangana irrigation minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy even as the state mobilised an array of specialised forces, including the Indian Army, Marine Commando Force, special forces of the Indian Navy,Border Roads Organisation (BRO), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and rat miners, to carry out rescue operations.On Wednesday afternoon, tunnel experts and disaster management officials inspected the tunnel. The team included BRO tunnel expert Col Parikshit Mehra, BRO former DG Gen Harpal Singh, and BRO former ADG KP Purushothaman, along with NDRF personnel.According to Uttam Kumar Reddy, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) that malfunctioned during the accident will be cut into pieces using gas-cutters and welding machines and removed from the tunnel. Meanwhile, the accumulated fine silt will be cleared manually and with the help of a small Bobcat machine.Silt removal will begin from the far end of the tunnel, progressing towards the entry point. Additionally, two 100 HP pumps will be employed to dewater the tunnel and manage the silt, Uttam said at Domalapenta, near the tunnel site.Govt is also exploring alternative access routes to expedite the rescue operation.This includes a proposal to create a bypass around 300 meters from the TBM area and reach the trapped workers by drilling. This bypass would facilitate the movement of manpower and machinery to the collapsed section of the tunnel where the roof gave way and where the TBM parts are now lodged, officials said.Uttam Kumar Reddy acknowledged that the scale of slush inside the tunnel had slowed down rescue efforts, but emphasised that the safety of the rescuers was govt's top priority. He said, ""We assessed the situation thoroughly and devised clear strategies to minimise risk for the rescuers and move forward efficiently.""Real-time monitoring of tunnel conditions is underway, with advanced imaging systems in place to assess structural stability.This ensures that rescue teams can continue their efforts without jeopardising their safety or that of the trapped workers.Earlier in the day, ministers Uttam and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy met senior officials, including Col Mehra, Navy officer VK Prasad, NDRF DIG Mohsen Shahedi, rat miners and BRO representatives to discuss effective ways to expedite the rescue operation.","Telangana's govt set a two-day deadline from Wednesday evening for the team of experts working to trace the eight workers buried under the collapsed Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel since Feb 22.

They had also moved dissent notes.The 655-page report was submitted to both the Houses of Parliament earlier this month. The panel while doing away with the ""Waqf by User"" provision, going forward, has allowed only existing ""Registered Waqf by User"" to be recognised as waqf.This will exclude the cases where the properties are under dispute or owned by the govt. As per the report, the panel had supported inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf boards, which can go upto four and recommended transfer of dispute investigation authority from district collectors to senior state govt appointees.The state waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community, ensuring broader representation.",The bill has been put in the priority list by the govt as part of its legislative business.

Silkyara tunnel heroes say Telangana battle tougher: 'Men trapped inside are silent',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silkyara-tunnel-heroes-say-telangana-battle-tougher-men-trapped-inside-are-silent/articleshow/118587404.cms,"‘In Silkyara we could hear them, here it’s just silence’

DEHRADUN: The tunnel has collapsed. Water and silt flood the narrow passage.Deep underground, there are eight men - trapped, unheard, unseen. At the mouth of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana, hundreds of rescuers battle against time, fighting to bring them back.Among them are three men who have been there before - and done that. Though in a different catastrophe, high up in the hills of Uttarakhand.Over a year ago, they had stood at the opening of another collapsed tunnel, overseeing another desperate mission. Then, too, hope hung by a thread. A diary entry would perhaps read: Silkyara, Uttarkashi. 41 men, 17 days.In the swirling dust and tension, the men who once defied the odds in Uttarakhand are fighting to do it again in Telangana even as they admit the battle this time is harder.A senior supervisor from the Silkyara tunnel project, Shashi Bhushan Chauhan , now standing at the SLBC collapse site, told TOI on Wednesday: ""Life has come full circle for us."" The words hang heavy in the damp air, thick with the smell of wet earth and diesel fumes. His voice is hoarse with exhaustion. It was in Nov 2023 that Chauhan first became a footnote in history, working beside an auger machine in the race to free the workers trapped inside Silkyara's blocked tunnel.This time, the crisis is different. The SLBC tunnel is narrower - just 33 feet wide compared to Silkyara's 45 feet. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) is stuck. Water and sludge keep pushing in. Communication lines? Non-existent. The men trapped in are silent. And silence is the worst kind of omen in a rescue mission. But Chauhan and his team - a mechanic and an industrial fabricator from the Navayuga Group - do not deal in omens. They deal in steel, sweat, and a deep, unspoken understanding of what it means to pull men from the earth before it swallows them.""The teamwork feels the same as it did in Silkyara - everyone pushing forward, driven by a single mission,"" Chauhan said. ""But there's one crucial difference. In Silkyara, we could hear them. We knew they were there, that they were holding on. Here, there's only silence. No voices, no signals, nothing. That uncertainty makes this even harder. We don't know their condition, and that makes every second feel heavier.""Another rescuer explains why this operation is even more challenging. ""The auger machine we used in Silkyara? That's not an option here. There's too much water, too much silt. The ground is shifting, unpredictable. We dewater, and more water rushes in. We clear the silt, and fresh sludge takes its place. Every step forward feels like one step back.""Hope, however, comes in the form of men who are built for the impossible. A six-member crew of ' rat-hole miners ', the underground warriors who crawled through Silkyara's debris to bring the last workers to safety, are standing by, ready to descend into the unknown again.""Our team arrived on Sunday. We're waiting,"" says Wakeel Hasan, their leader. ""When the moment comes, we go in."" No bravado, no unnecessary words.Just the quiet, unwavering certainty of men who have walked into darkness before and come out carrying lives.","Eight men trapped in collapsed tunnel in Telangana.

Supreme Court stays Centre's green clearance exemption order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-centres-green-clearance-exemption-order/articleshow/118587341.cms,"MUMBAI: Supreme Court has stayed a recent notification by the Centre placing certain projects out of the purview of prior clearance under the environment impact assessment norms and issued notice to the environment ministry on a public interest litigation (PIL), reports Swati Deshpande.NGO Vanashakti had on Feb 16 moved the PIL, saying the notification significantly diluted the stringent environmental clearances (EC) regime. It sought quashing of a Jan 29 notification by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change doing away with mandatory prior EC for construction projects with a built-up area up to 1,50,000 sq m in cases of industrial sheds, and school, college and hostel for educational institutions.The PIL filed in SC by an NGO against the Centre's move exempting certain projects from prior green nod also challenged a Jan 30 memorandum which clarified that educational institutions would include private technical institutions, professional academies, universities along with warehouses, industrial sheds, housing machinery etc.The SC bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan on Monday heard senior counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan for the NGO and issued notice to Centre. The next hearing is on March 28. The SC order said, ""In the meanwhile, there will be stay of operation and implementation of the notification dated 29th January, 2025 as well as office memorandum dated 30th January, 2025.""The new notification excludes all such projects from the purview of environment impact assessment or EIA, 2006 as against the current criteria, which requires prior EC for all building and construction projects having a built-up area above 20,000 sq m. The PIL said, ""General conditions have been made inapplicable to building construction projects thereby seriously affecting the process of appraisal of all such projects in eco-sensitive areas, protected areas under Wildlife Act, critically and severally polluted areas and projects located at inter-state boundaries.""If the new notification is enforced, it ""would potentially destroy the land, water and air environment and ecology due to unregulated construction activities which would have a disastrous effect leaving a magnitude of environmental footprint that would be impossible to determine and reverse,"" said the PIL, stressing that a built-up area of 20,000 sq m is itself a fairly large size of 2.16 lakh sq ft, but the new, higher cut-off would mean 16 lakh sq ft of construction would not need any prior EC. The notification would have done away with the need for prior EC for a large number of projects in Mumbai, legal experts said.","NGO Vanashakti had on Feb 16 moved the PIL, saying the notification significantly diluted the stringent environmental clearances (EC) regime.

The flyover was meant to eliminate the signal at TIDEL Park and ensure uninterrupted flow of traffic on the stretch from SRP Tools to Madhya Kailash.Under the new plan, vehicles going from Thiruvanmiyur towards Madhya Kailash should turn left, use the flyover, and merge onto OMR.

"In Supreme Court, government opposes life ban on convicted netas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-supreme-court-government-opposes-life-ban-on-convicted-netas/articleshow/118587195.cms,"'Only Parl can decide if lifetime ban would be appropriate or not'

NEW DELHI: Opposing the plea that the six-year disqualification for convicted persons from contesting polls be turned into a lifelong ban, Centre has told Supreme Court that the present law was constitutionally sound and it should be left to Parliament to decide on amending the law and the judiciary should refrain from passing direction.In an affidavit filed in SC, the Centre argued that there was nothing wrong in imposing time-bound penalty as other grounds of disqualification - such as holding an office of profit, unsoundness of mind, insolvency and not being a citizen of India - were not permanent but time-bound and disqualification was tied to the existence of a supervening circumstance.According to Section 8 of Representation of the People Act, the period of disqualification kicks in six years from the date of conviction or in case of imprisonment, six years from the date of release.Challenging the provision, advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, now with BJP, filed a petition seeking SC's direction to do away with time-bound penalty and bar a convicted person for life from contesting MP/MLA election, forming political party or becoming office-bearer of a political party.Disputing the contention, the Centre said, ""Disqualifications made under the impugned sections are limited by time as a matter of parliamentary policy and it would not be appropriate to substitute the petitioner's understanding of the issue and impose a lifetime ban. As a matter of judicial review, the court can declare the provisions to be unconstitutional and declare them to be inoperative, however, the relief that he is seeking amounts to rewriting of the provision as it effectively seeks to read 'lifelong' instead of 'six years' in all sub-sections of Section 8 of the Act.""The govt said whether a lifetime ban would be appropriate or not was a question that was solely within the domain of Parliament. ""Numerous laws provide for penalties limited by time, in the same manner as in the impugned Act. It is submitted that this is in line with well-established principles governing penal law. By confining the operation of the penalty to an appropriate length of time, deterrence is ensured while undue harshness is avoided,"" the affidavit said.""The issues raised by the petitioner have wide-ranging ramifications and clearly fall within the legislative policy of Parliament and the contours of judicial review would be suitably altered in such regard. SC has held that legislative choice over one option or the other cannot be questioned in courts over its efficacy or otherwise,"" it added. ""A lifetime disqualification is the maximum that can be imposed under the provisions and to impose such a disqualification is certainly within the power of Parliament.""The prayer of the petitioner amounts to rewriting of the statute or directing Parliament to frame a law in a particular manner which is wholly beyond the powers of judicial review. It is trite law that courts cannot direct Parliament to make a law or to legislate in a particular way,"" the affidavit said.","The govt said whether a lifetime ban would be appropriate or not was a question that was solely within the domain of Parliament.

7 BJP MLAs join Nitish Kumar cabinet: Changed power dynamics at play in Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-bjp-mlas-join-nitish-kumar-cabinet-changed-power-dynamics-at-play-in-bihar/articleshow/118584163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Is the stage set for a shift in power dynamics within the ruling NDA in Bihar ? Is it the beginning of BJP 's assertion over JD(U) in Bihar? Well, the answer to these questions is ""yes"" if today's cabinet expansion in the state is an indication to go by.Chief minister Nitish Kumar inducted 7 new faces in his ministry - all of them members of his alliance partner the BJP. The cabinet expansion, which was pending for almost a year, was finalised after BJP chief JP Nadda had a meeting with Nitish Kumar.Today's expansion, possibly the last one ahead of year-end assembly elections, has ensured that the two main NDA partners in the state - the BJP and the JD(U) - have representation in the ministry proportional to their numerical strength in the assembly. The BJP, which won 74 seats in the 2020 assembly elections now has 21 ministers while Nitish Kumar's JD(U), which won 43 seats, has 13 including the chief minister.Also read: BJP gets nervous every time Nitish Kumar picks up his phone,' Congress reacts to Bihar cabinet expansion The 2020 assembly elections marked a significant shift in number dynamics within the ruling NDA in Bihar. For the first time, the BJP, which was the junior partner in the alliance for over 15 years, overtook the JD(U) in the numbers game and became the senior partner of the alliance. However, the BJP then did not stake claim to the chief minister's post and kept its pre-poll promise of forming the NDA government under Nitish Kumar.In all earlier assembly elections after 2000, when Jharkhand was bifurcated out of Bihar, the JD(U) always won more seats than the BJP and was the dominant partner. For almost two decades, Nitish Kumar was the undisputed leader of the alliance.However, going ahead, this may change and the cabinet expansion was perhaps the first big indication.""The cabinet expansion is the first sign of BJP assertion over JD(U) and it is the beginning. In the coming days, the BJP will assert more as the party realises this could be its best time to dominate in Bihar,"" says political analyst and former professor of Patna University N K Choudhary.Choudhary has an interesting take on why Nitish can't complain about BJP dominance. ""Politics is not for social service. For almost two decades, Nitish Kumar ensured that state BJP leaders played second fiddle to him. He he could do that because he was a tall and undisputed leader. But that seems to be changing now and the last elections saw JD(U) become a junior partner in alliance. The BJP on the other hand has a very strong national leadership at present and it is natural that it will not play second fiddle any more,"" Choudhary adds.Those who know Nitish Kumar's style of governance in the last 20 years would agree that if given a free hand, the Bihar chief minister would not have opted for cabinet expansion with elections in the state just months away. But the BJP, confident with its electoral successes in Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi, would surely have other plans for the state.Also read: Who are 7 new ministers in Nitish Kumar's cabinet and why BJP picked them A close look at the names picked up by the BJP would show that the party has carefully used the exercise to plan for the assembly elections.The list of new ministers includes a JD(U) leader who has represented Bihar Sharif, in the CM's pocket borough Nalanda, for five times, thrice on a JD(U) ticket before crossing over to the BJP in 2015.Another notable entry is Krishna Kumar Mantu, the MLA from Amnour in Saran district, who was recently in the news for organising a ""Kurmi Chetna Rally"" in Patna. This is interesting because Nitish Kumar belongs to this powerful OBC community and one wonders why he would want a leader who is mobilising Kurmis for BJP in his cabinet.Nitish Kumar, who has earned the dubious distinction of ""Paltu ram"" due to his alliance flip-flops, faces a tough road ahead. It will be interesting to see how the JD(U) chief who has dictated terms in the past negotiates a demanding BJP going ahead.","Nitish Kumar inducted 7 new faces in his ministry - all of them members of his alliance partner the BJP. The BJP, which won 74 seats in the 2020 assembly elections now has 21 ministers.

According to a Financial Times report, a proposal by Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to US President Donald Trump , to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles. The Five Eyes alliance—comprising the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—has been a cornerstone of Western intelligence cooperation since World War II.

, to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles. The Five Eyes alliance—comprising the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—has been a cornerstone of Western intelligence cooperation since World War II. The move comes at a time when Trump has openly derided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, repeatedly referring to him as ‘governor Trudeau’ in a veiled assertion of US dominance over its closest ally. Trump’s vision for Canada—jokingly or not—as America’s “51st state” has intensified with economic pressure, including a fresh wave of 25% tariffs on Canadian imports, set to take effect in March 2025.

Navarro has denied the report, calling it ""crazy stuff,"" but the idea is consistent with Trump’s America First approach, which has often questioned traditional alliances. While it remains uncertain whether this proposal will gain traction within the Trump administration, the implications are significant—not just for Canada but also for India, a country with growing intelligence ties to Five Eyes members.

Cracks in the Five Eyes?

For nearly 80 years, the Five Eyes alliance has been the gold standard for intelligence-sharing among Western nations. Born out of World War II codebreaking cooperation between the US and the UK, the alliance has grown into a sophisticated network coordinating signals intelligence (SIGINT), counterterrorism efforts, and geopolitical monitoring. Expelling Canada—a founding member—would mark an unprecedented rupture, one that intelligence officials warn could embolden adversaries like China and Russia.

“Sitting where I’m sitting and looking at the array of threats that are coming at us, we need all the partners we can get,” a Five Eyes intelligence official told the FT.

Former CIA official Dennis Wilder echoed the sentiment, describing the Five Eyes as “by far the most successful intelligence-sharing arrangement in world history.” Disrupting it, he warned, would be “met with cheers from Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang.”

Yet, within Trump’s MAGA movement, skepticism toward America’s traditional allies is growing. The Trump administration has frequently accused Canada of taking advantage of the US economically and politically, positioning Ottawa as a target for policy changes that reflect Trump’s aggressive trade and national security priorities.

Between the lines

India’s calculus

For India, this shift in US foreign policy presents a mixed bag. On one hand, a weakened Five Eyes could mean less coordination on global intelligence matters, reducing the quality of intelligence India receives. On the other hand, a sidelined Canada might be forced to recalibrate its diplomatic approach towards India.

Canada has used intelligence from Five Eyes in its accusations against India, most notably in the case of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Khalistani terrorist killed in Canada in 2023. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly cited Five Eyes intelligence when accusing India of involvement in the killing—claims New Delhi has vehemently denied. If Canada were removed from the alliance, its access to such intelligence could be curtailed.

, a Khalistani terrorist killed in Canada in 2023. Canadian Prime Minister publicly cited Five Eyes intelligence when accusing India of involvement in the killing—claims New Delhi has vehemently denied. If Canada were removed from the alliance, its access to such intelligence could be curtailed. From India’s perspective, this could be beneficial. The Five Eyes framework has allowed Canada to access intelligence that it might not be able to gather independently. Without Five Eyes support, Ottawa may find it harder to substantiate allegations against India in future diplomatic disputes. This could lead to a reduction in tensions and a potential recalibration of India-Canada relations, especially after Trudeau steps down on March 9, 2025.

Final thoughts

The proposal to remove Canada from Five Eyes is more than just a bureaucratic reshuffling—it represents a fundamental shift in the way alliances are structured under Trump’s vision of US foreign policy.

The move signals a more transactional US approach to alliances, one that prioritizes short-term leverage over long-term strategic cooperation. If intelligence-sharing becomes a tool for economic and political coercion, many other countries may need to rethink their reliance on US-led security frameworks.

The US is by far the largest contributor to Five Eyes intelligence, and any fragmentation within the alliance could undermine coordinated intelligence efforts on issues like cyber threats, counterterrorism, and China’s military movements in the Indo-Pacific.

There are risks for India as well. A weakened Five Eyes could mean less effective intelligence cooperation between India and its key partners like the US and UK. New Delhi has been working toward closer intelligence collaboration with Five Eyes members, with discussions in recent years about potentially expanding the alliance to include India, Japan, and South Korea. If Five Eyes fractures, it could derail these efforts and weaken India’s intelligence-gathering capabilities.

In the Trump era of shifting alliances and growing geopolitical tensions, the intelligence-sharing framework of the Five Eyes is facing a seismic challenge.This proposal is not an isolated event but part of Trump’s broader strategy to reshape global alliances based on ideological alignment with his nationalist agenda. The Five Eyes network has been the backbone of Western intelligence for decades, facilitating deep cooperation on signals intelligence (SIGINT), counterterrorism, and cyber threats.However, Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement has been increasingly skeptical of traditional alliances, particularly those with nations governed by left-leaning leaders. JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, has called Britain “the world’s first truly Islamist country” due to its growing Muslim population, raising further concerns about the administration’s willingness to work with historically close partners. Meanwhile, Australia and New Zealand—both under left-leaning governments—have also seen their strategic importance questioned by Trump’s allies.(With inputs from agencies)","A proposal by Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to US President Donald Trump, to remove Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and intelligence circles. The move comes at a time when Trump has openly derided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, repeatedly referring to him as ‘governor Trudeau’ Expelling Canada would mark an unprecedented rupture, one that intelligence officials warn could embolden adversaries like China and Russia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118583249,imgsize-118017,width-400,resizemode-4/118583249.jpg"
Panel: Give ‘exemplary penalty’ to curb ‘sarpanch patis’ practice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/impose-exemplary-penalties-to-curb-practice-of-sarpanch-patis-in-pris-suggests-panel/articleshow/118584389.cms,"NEW DELHI: To curb the practice of proxy participation of husbands and other male relatives often referred to as “Sarpanch patis”, “Mukhiya Patis” and “Pradhan Patis” in place of elected women ‘pradhans’ in gram panchayats, an advisory committee set up by the ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has suggested that “exemplary penalties” should be enforced for proven cases of proxy leadership .The committee has also suggested a robust reporting mechanism through helplines and womens watchdog committees for confidential complaints about proxy leadership, with whistleblower rewards in verified cases.The report on “Transforming Women’s Representation and Roles in Panchayati Raj Systems and Institutions: Eliminating Efforts for Proxy Participation” submitted to the secretary of the ministry has also suggested a detailed roadmap on the way forward with interventions ranging from behavioural change through capacity-building and mentorship, and establishing a monitoring framework from the grassroots to the top.The advisory committee was set-up by the ministry in September 2023 following the Supreme Court’s order of July on the issue. Besides research of available literature and extensive consultations with the state govts, the report is based on interactions of four intensive regional workshops involving 14 States.Secretary MoPR, Vivek Bharadwaj told TOI that they are developing an action plan which will be discussed and shared with states for consultation and execution. “To begin with we will be launching a capacity building programme exclusively for elected women representatives next week which will be looking at leadership and its challenges from the women’s perspective to equip them better to execute their roles,” Bharadwaj said.On the suggestion for penalties and punishments in cases of proxy leadership, he said that they are considering setting up a committee of secretaries of states going forward to study and decide how legal measures can be standardised and executed on the ground to create deterrence.The 73rd Constitutional (Amendment) Act 1992 mandates one-third reservation of seats for women in the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). However, 21 States and 2 UTs have expanded this Constitutional provision and extended reservation for women to the extent of 50% in the PRIs. In nearly 2.63 lakh panchayats — out of the 32.29 lakh elected representatives approximately 15.03 lakh (around 47%) are women.Some of the key policy interventions and structural reforms suggested by the committee include creating gender-exclusive quotas in some Panchayat subject committees and ward-level committees on the lines of Kerala; appointing women’s ombuds-persons and federation of women Panchayat leaders. The report also calls for institutionalising gender-responsive budgets in Panchayat meetings.The report also calls for leveraging technology to combat the problem by adopting interventions like virtual reality (VR) simulation training; integrating AI-powered query-driven replies to provide real-time legal and governance guidance to women elected representatives in vernacular languages.For stepping up monitoring, it is recommended that WhatsApp Groups of women representatives could be created and linked with officials of Panchayats and Block Officials to help solve the day-to-day problems. Also the MoPR’s Panchayat Nirnay Portal can serve as a platform for citizens to track elected Pradhans’ participation in meetings and decisions for public accountability and discouraging proxy leadership.The committee has also recommended direct mentorship of elected women pradhans by the MLAs and MP and dedicated women-only monitoring councils at district and block levels, comprising experienced women ERs and retired officials.",The committee has also suggested a robust reporting mechanism through helplines and womens watchdog committees.

NEW DELHI: After the breakthrough in developing a hyperloop test track (422m) by IIT Madras with support from Indian Railways , the government is now planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport, said minister Ashwini Vaishnaw . It may be the longest hyperloop track in the world.""The first tube will go a long way in developing technologies. The time has come when after the first two grants of $1million each (nearly ₹9cr), the third grant of $1million will be given to IIT Madras for further developing the hyperloop project in a nice way. And once we see the commercial or rather pre-commercial where the product is ready, then within the railway set-up we will start the first commercial project. We will decide a site, which can be used for good commercial transportation of 40km-50km and then we will go for it,"" Vaishnaw said while addressing the closing ceremony of Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition by IIT Madras.Sources said the test track for commercial operation will help railways assess viability of the technology. The hyperloop track can allow speeds of up to 1,200kmph. The successful development of the first test track, which was completed in Dec last year, will be the base for future development.Hyperloop systems are expected to dramatically reduce travel times between cities, offering an alternative to traditional rail and air travel. The hyperloop concept envisions high-speed, low-pressure pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,200 kmph.The hyperloop system was first conceptualised by Swiss professor Marcel Juffer in the 1970s. In 1992, Swissmetro SA was set up to develop this project, but it went into liquidation in 2009. At present, there are eight promising hyperloop projects in the world, including Virgin Hyperloop which has been actively testing its systems in Nevada. Canadian firm TransPod is also constructing a test track to validate their design.In an official statement, the railway ministry said IIT-Madras and railways will also work together on vertical take-off landing vehicles.","The government is planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport.

He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket.

What’s done (by home minister Amit Shah) in in some way is a reflection what Sardar Patel did at that time…once again stitching the nation together,” he said while addressing the large crowds gathered for the Mahashivratri celebrations organised by the Isha Foundation here here.Recalling the blasts that took place “every month” in the country until over a decade ago — rocking a new venue each time, be it Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune — Sadhguru said in the last 10 years, “thanks to the agencies, forces, and above all the one who leads them — our beloved home minister — and the determined hand with which he has handled all this, this is not like the country where militancy ruled; it is now largely in control”. ““He has made a promise that by 2026, militancy (Left wing extremism) will be completely eliminated,” he added.Terming as “fantastic” the decision to abrogate Article 370 in Kashmir, restore peace and make the security situation in the UT almost normal, “with lakhs of tourist coming in”, Sadhguru said economic development, education, technology and spirituality tend to go waste if basics like law and order and geographical sovereignty of the country are not maintained.“This is a very thankless job. Everybody thinks that you are (acting) hard..but there is no soft way of doing this, as I see it. It is a great mission that he (Shah) has taken up.

"Can’t collect toll if road in bad shape, says J&K HC; cuts fee at 2 NH-44 plazas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-collect-toll-if-road-in-bad-shape-says-jk-hc-cuts-fee-at-2-nh-44-plazas/articleshow/118587123.cms,"NHAI rarely uses power to cut toll on unfinished roads

NEW DELHI: In an order that is likely to have wider ramifications, J&K and Ladakh high court has said that if a highway is in bad shape ""due to different nature of construction activities"", NHAI or its concessionaire cannot collect toll tax from commuters.Hearing a PIL on the Pathankot-Udhampur stretch of NH-44, a bench of Chief Justice Tashi Rabstan and Justice M A Choudhary Tuesday ordered NHAI to collect only 20% of the toll, with immediate effect, at two toll plazas - Lakhanpur and Bann - till the highway from Lakhanpur to Udhampur is fully operational.HC also directed NHAI not to establish any plaza within 60 km of NH-44 and instructed removal of such structures within two months. ""Further, there should not be mushrooming of such plazas in the two UTs only with the sole aim and objective of minting money from the general public,"" it said.Though NHAI has the power to suspend or reduce 'user fee', popularly known as toll, on unfinished or dilapidated NHs, it has rarely used this provision. Poor maintenance, riding quality and diversions during expansion of projects have been major irritants for commuters as they are made to pay full user fee without getting the desired benefit.One Sugandha Sawhney had filed the PIL seeking exemption of toll at Lakhanpur, Thandi Khui and Bann plazas on the national highway from Pathankot to Udhampur, where construction is underway as a part of the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway project. The petitioner had submitted that about 60% to 70% of this stretch is under construction since December, 2021, yet NHAI was collecting toll at Lakhanpur, Thandi Khui and Ban plazas despite the rules saying that collection of fee should commence within 45 days from the date of completion of the section.While passing the order, the court said, ""This is based on the principle that tolls are collected to provide users with the benefit of well maintained infrastructure. If this highway is in a deteriorated condition and uncomfortable to drive on, it is considered unfair for commuters to continue paying tolls, rather the same is violation of fair service. Certainly, the commuters and drivers must be feeling frustrated by the poor state of this particular highway they are paying to use. The basic premise is that tolls should be a form of compensation for road users in exchange for smooth, safe, and well-maintained highways.""The court took note of the NHAI submission that due to different nature of construction works being carried out at this highway, service roads and diversions have been provided for the movement of traffic; meaning thereby the 4-lane NH at most of the places has been reduced to single lane.","J&K and Ladakh high court said that if a highway is in bad shape ""due to different nature of construction activities"", NHAI or its concessionaire cannot collect toll tax from commuters.HC also directed NHAi not to establish any plaza within 60 km of NH-44 and instructed removal of such structures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118587124,imgsize-869069,width-400,resizemode-4/118587124.jpg"

PUNE: The first cases of avian influenza virus (H5N1) in domestic cats in India were reported from Chhindwara district in Madhya Pradesh, raising concerns about the bird flu pathogen mutating and infecting humans.""H5N1 is classically an avian virus, but certain mutations allow it to replicate in mammalian hosts. This adaptability raises concerns because influenza viruses have the potential to trigger pandemics, as seen in past outbreaks like Covid-19,"" a scientist said. Scientists from ICAR-NIHSAD and Union govt's animal husbandry department have documented the cases this Jan in Chhindwara, which borders Nagpur - where several big cats died of bird flu in Dec last year.The scientific team identified the virus as belonging to the 2.3.2.1a lineage, a variant of H5N1 that has caused outbreaks in poultry across India. ""These cases represent the first documented instances of this particular strain infecting domestic cats in India,"" the study says.It found that all infected cats exhibited symptoms such as high fever, loss of appetite, and lethargy before succumbing to the illness within one to three days after sample collection. The study identified 27 mutations in the virus found in cats. Scientists called for enhanced surveillance in domestic poultry, wild birds, and mammals, including pets and humans, given the virus's ability to jump between species.""Although human infections have been rare, we must anticipate the virus adapting to efficient transmission to and between humans. Human-to-human transmission is still not efficient, but ongoing changes in the virus signal to us to stay vigilant and prepared even for a pandemic,"" virologist Jacob John said. On the virus's potential to cause a global outbreak, John cautioned: ""H5N1 is new for humans. We do not have immunity against it. If human-to-human transmission becomes efficient, as an extension of the present pattern of mammalian transmission, it is going to be a concern.""","H5N1 is classically an avian virus, but certain mutations allow it to replicate in mammalian hosts.

Jaipur LPG tanker crash: Investigation finds fault on part of NHAI and tanker’s owner and consigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaipur-lpg-tanker-crash-investigation-finds-fault-on-part-of-nhai-and-tankers-owner-and-consigner/articleshow/118585108.cms,"NEW DELHI: An investigation into the Jaipur LPG tanker crash that claimed 21 lives has pointed out faults on the part of NHAI and its agencies, and the owner and consigner of the tanker for non-compliance of safety standards as well as negligence of the deceased driver of the goods truck that hit the tanker.The findings of the crash investigation conducted by the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE) with support from the Jaipur Police was presented at a mock court, chaired by former IPS Kiran Bedi , on Wednesday at the College of Traffic Management in Faridabad.The probe report mentions that the tanker driver can be absolved of the offence of dangerous or negligent driving as he took the U-turn on the highway “cautiously”. However, the FIR by the Jaipur Police, registered hours after the fatal crash, has accused the drivers of the LPG tanker and the goods truck of speeding and negligence, which, according to police, resulted in the accident. The FIR has not mentioned any other entity for the crash. Police are yet to file a chargesheet in the case.The crash happened on the Jaipur-Kishangarh highway in Rajasthan on Dec 20 last year. The goods-carrier truck collided with the BPCL tanker carrying LPG when the tanker was making the U-turn. There was an explosion due to gas leak from the tanker as its inlet-outlet nozzle had broken in the accident.The findings of another crash investigation carried out by SaveLife Foundation for the road transport ministry, which was presented to minister Nitin Gadkari recently, identified almost similar reasons behind the fatal accident, including the inadequate gap-in-median treatment, road signage, non-functional traffic signal and absence of safety mechanism at the valve (nozzle).The IRTE’s report mentions that as the proposed cloverleaf had not been built even in six years, “drivers have no choice but to take the U-turn (gap-in-median), thereby increasing traffic conflicts and the subsequent risk of accidents”. It pointed to faulty design of the U-turn, which is like a junction since this gap was the main interchange between NH-48 and NH-148C. It found that while large vehicles of more than 18 metres in length may require a turning radius of more than 18 metres to negotiate the turn from extreme left, the radius available was only 11.5 metres.The report stated that the traffic signal functioned only between 8 am and 7 pm, and after dark hours, it was put on amber blinking mode. “It is such a busy stretch, and hence, the traffic signal should function round the clock,” said Rohit Baluja, president of IRTE. The probe also found that while before the fatal accident there was only one speed sign of 50 kmph installed 375 metres before the junction, three speed signs were installed after the crash.Quoting police, the report said 29 crashes had occurred at the same junction and stretch in three years, claiming 29 lives and leaving 26 injured. “The responsible authorities, contractors, consultants and concessionaires neither took precaution nor rectified the deficiencies. Therefore, they should be booked under MV Act and BNS,” it said.The report said the driver of the goods truck was apparently travelling at 40-55 kmph and it was within the set speed limit. However, as a responsible driver he should have slowed down to 30 kmph when approaching gap-in-median with a blinker amber. It also flagged how the truck body was not as per standard.Based on the interview of the tanker driver to the investigation team, the report said he had a hazardous goods driving permit valid till July 2025. The driver was behind the wheel for 18 hours before the accident, and without a helper. On the way he had two stops to have dinner and sleep for six hours (10 pm to 4 am). He resumed driving at 4 am. It pointed to how the owner and the consigner violated the law of allowing the driver to work for more than eight hours and for not deploying another driver.The Industry LPG Transport Discipline Guidelines, which is part of transport agreement signed between oil companies and transporters, specifies that there should be two tanker truck (TT) drivers. It specifies that “No TT shall be plied by the driver without the second driver, either on the road or at any workplace.”With regard to the explosion due to non-compliance of safety standards for nozzles, the report said, “The incident underscores the critical need for robust safety regulations, enforcement, design standards and periodic verification of design intent of vehicles transporting hazardous materials.”",The crash happened on the Jaipur-Kishangarh highway in Rajasthan on Dec 20 last year.

NEW DELHI: The Sino-Indian ties are set for a reboot, following the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri that resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation”, said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong Tuesday.The remarks followed the recent meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Wang Yi in which the former had lauded cooperation between the 2 countries on multilateral forums, particularly the G20. Doval had visited China in December for talks between the Special Representatives that took place after a gap of 5 years. This was followed by Misri’s visit to China during which India and China agreed to resume Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , trans-border river cooperation and, in principle, direct air services.“Since the meeting between President Xi Jinping and PM Modi in Kazan last year, the 2 sides have earnestly implemented the important consensus reached by the two leaders, engaged in active interactions at various levels, and reached many common understandings on improving bilateral relations,’’ said Xu, interacting with journalists on the margins the 3rd China-India Youth Dialogue. Calling India-China relationship one of the most important in the world, the ambassador said that the 2 countries are promoting positive changes in the international balance of power.For the first time in 5 years, Modi and Xi had met in Russia in October 2024 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, days after the 2 countries reached an agreement to complete the military disengagement process in eastern Ladakh. India, however, wants to tread cautiously in normalising ties with China and, in his meeting with Wang last week, Jaishankar stressed the importance of restoring mutual trust in bilateral ties and jointly maintaining border peace.Calling for respecting each other’s core interests, Xu said that Xi and Modi had agreed to handle relations from a long-term perspective, prevent “specific disagreements” from affecting the overall relationship, enhance strategic mutual trust and ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas.China will host the SCO summit later this year and expects Modi to participate. Appreciating India’s contribution to the Eurasian bloc, Xu said China is willing to work with India to host a “friendly, united and fruitful” summit. China holds the rotating presidency of SCO this year.According to the ambassador, the recent high-level engagements had created an important opportunity for the “reboot of China-India relations and provided a broader platform for exchanges and cooperation between the youth of our 2 countries”.","The Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last year and the subsequent visits to Beijing by NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Vikram Misri resulted in a series of “common understandings on the boundary question and practical cooperation’, said Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong Tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118567866,imgsize-1050506,width-400,resizemode-4/118567866.jpg"

Anna Horford: More Than Just an NBA Star’s Sister

Credits: Anna Horford/Instagram

If you thought NBA drama was wild, wait until you hear about the latest feud between Anna Horford and two of the biggest names in politics and business—Donald Trump and Elon Musk . The outspoken sister of Boston Celtics veteran Al Horford is known for never holding back on social media, and this time, she’s got her sights set on the 2024 president and his billionaire ally.While Al Horford is making his mark on the court, Anna has built her own platform off of it. With a strong social media presence, she’s carved out a reputation for her unfiltered takes on sports, pop culture, and, most notably, politics. And if there’s one thing she’s made crystal clear over the years, it’s that she’s no fan of Donald Trump or his policies.On Tuesday, Anna once again took aim at the former president—who reclaimed the White House in 2024—and his new right-hand man, Elon Musk. This time, her criticism was aimed at their latest government initiative, and she didn’t hold back.When Trump returned to office, one of his first moves was appointing Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The goal? To cut unnecessary spending and streamline government operations. However, since its inception, the program has faced widespread scrutiny for its aggressive budget cuts—especially in the federal workforce.Anna Horford wasn’t about to let this slide. She took to her Instagram story to share a report revealing that, despite Musk and Trump’s promises, DOGE isn’t actually expected to save any money. With her signature bluntness, she added her own commentary:“It’s almost like Elon Musk & Trump have no f*cking clue what they’re doing. Huh…”That wasn’t Anna’s only dig of the day. She also shared another post that made scathing accusations about Trump’s personal hygiene—because, apparently, no topic is off-limits when it comes to her critiques. Meanwhile, as Anna roasts Trump and Musk online, her brother Al Horford is chasing his second NBA title with the Celtics. At 38, he remains a key piece of Boston’s championship aspirations.ALSO READ: Denver Nuggets Star Aaron Gordon Bares It All in Eyebrow Raising in New Underwear Campaign Trump, of course, is no stranger to reality TV feuds, after all, he spent years hosting ""The Apprentice"" before entering politics. But something tells us he wasn’t expecting this kind of heat from an NBA player’s sister.

In the United States, the term ""Green Card"" refers to the Permanent Resident Card, a well-established document granting individuals lawful permanent residency. Recently, President Donald Trump introduced a proposal for a ""Gold Card"", a new visa program aimed at affluent foreign investors. This initiative is designed to replace the existing EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program . This analysis delves into the distinctions between the traditional Green Card and the proposed Gold Card, examining their eligibility criteria, benefits, and potential implications.A Green Card allows non-US citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Holders can eventually apply for US citizenship, provided they meet certain residency and legal requirements.On February 25, 2025, President Trump announced the ""Gold Card"" visa program, targeting wealthy foreign investors willing to contribute $5 million to the US economy. This initiative aims to attract affluent individuals who can stimulate economic growth and job creation.The Gold Card is designed to replace the EB-5 program, which has faced criticism for being ""full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud,"" according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. By increasing the investment threshold and streamlining the process, the administration aims to attract high-caliber investors and reduce potential abuses.The administration anticipates that the Gold Card program could attract up to a million investors, potentially generating $5 trillion in revenue. These funds could play a significant role in reducing the national debt and stimulating economic growth.Implementing the Gold Card program may face legal hurdles, as changes to immigration laws typically require Congressional approval. The administration asserts that the program can proceed without new legislation, but this stance may be contested.The introduction of a pay-to-immigrate system raises questions about equity and the values underpinning US immigration policy. While the program aims to attract individuals who can contribute economically, it may be perceived as favouring the wealthy over other deserving immigrants.","A Green Card allows non-US citizens to live and work permanently in the United States.

Here are the common FAQs:



Q: What is the 'gold card' visa, and how does it differ from a traditional green card?

Q: How will the gold card impact Indian nationals waiting for green cards?

Offer a faster route for wealthy Indians who can afford it.

Exclude middle-tier investors who previously used EB-5 as an alternative to employment-based green cards.

Shift focus from job creation to wealth, favouring Indian business tycoons over skilled professionals.

Q: Will the gold card replace the EB-5 investor visa program?

Q: Can Indians currently on H-1B or EB-2/EB-3 visas apply for the gold card?

Q: How will this affect Indians who were considering the EB-5 visa?

Q: How many gold cards will be available, and will there be a cap like EB-5?

Q: Could Indian tech CEOs, startup founders, or business leaders benefit from the gold card?

Q: Will the gold card need congressional approval, or can Trump implement it directly?

Q: What are the risks associated with the gold card?

Uncertainty: Details on processing, vetting, and long-term benefits are still vague.

Legal challenges: Congress or courts may challenge its legality.

Affordability: At $5 million, it excludes many Indians who could afford EB-5 but not this steep jump.

Q: What other options do Indians have if the gold card is too expensive?

Is the gold card a game-changer for Indians?

The gold card presents a fast-track residency option—but only for India’s ultra-rich. For the broader Indian diaspora, especially H-1B holders and EB-5 investors, it signals a shift toward wealth-based immigration, leaving most to navigate the backlogged employment-based system. While it may be an attractive shortcut for billionaires and corporate-backed talent, for the majority, it represents a roadblock rather than a solution.

(With inputs from agencies)

President Donald Trump’s proposal to introduce a $5 million ""gold card"" visa as a replacement for the EB-5 investor program has sparked major concerns among Indian nationals waiting for US green cards . With over 1 million Indians stuck in employment-based backlogs—some for over 50 years—the shift toward a wealth-based immigration model could drastically reshape their options.President Donald Trump has proposed a new ""gold card"" visa, which would grant green card privileges and a pathway to US citizenship for a $5 million fee. Unlike the traditional EB-5 investor visa, which requires a $800,000-$1.05 million investment in a business that creates at least 10 US jobs, the gold card has no such job creation requirement. Instead, it is being positioned as a premium residency option for wealthy individuals.Indians are among the largest groups waiting for US green cards, with backlogs exceeding 50 years in some employment-based categories. The gold card could:Yes. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the gold card would replace EB-5 in two weeks. Trump criticized EB-5, calling it “full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud.” While EB-5 required job creation, the gold card is simply a direct purchase of US residency and citizenship eligibility.Yes, if they have $5 million to pay for it. Trump described the gold card as a ""road to citizenship for people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.” This suggests that companies may also sponsor highly skilled employees, though details remain unclear.For Indians who planned to use EB-5, the fivefold increase in investment cost (from $1 million to $5 million) could make it unaffordable. While EB-5 investors could pool funds or take structured loans, the gold card seems to require upfront cash, limiting accessibility to India’s ultra-rich elite.Trump claimed, ""We’ll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards,"" and even suggested selling 10 million to reduce the US deficit. Unlike EB-5, which had a cap, the gold card appears to have no numerical limit—it is purely a revenue-driven scheme.Yes. The program seems tailored for India’s wealthiest entrepreneurs, tech executives, and industrialists. Those who want to bypass H-1B visa lotteries and EB-2/EB-3 backlogs could find this an attractive alternative. However, its lack of clarity around job creation, business investment, and processing time raises concerns.Trump said that congressional approval is not required, but legal experts disagree. If lawsuits or political opposition arise, implementation could be delayed or blocked—something Indian applicants should consider before committing funds.For those unable to afford the gold card, traditional employment-based green cards (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3) and the H-1B visa remain options, although processing times are long. If the gold card significantly reduces EB-5 interest, Indians already in the EB-5 pipeline may have fewer competitors, potentially improving their chances.","President Donald Trump has proposed a new ""gold card"" visa, which would grant green card privileges and a pathway to US citizenship for a $5 million fee.

Although Rodgers used to be considered among the best quarterbacks of his generation, his play has tailed off in recent years.After being traded to the Jets in 2023, Aaron Rodgers played only four snaps before a ruptured Achilles tendon ended his season. He returned the following year but struggled to make an impact, throwing for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, even with the addition of Davante Adams. Now, with the Jets parting ways with the four-time MVP, who will sign Rodgers in 2025.James Jones said, ""Aaron's never been in this situation. Aaron has been MVP, MVP, MVP, MVP—Super Bowl MVP... Eeverything Aaron Rodgers wants, Aaron Rodgers got. Aaron Rodgers has never been in this situation where—I ain't gonna say he's begging—but who want me? No, no, for real. He's never been in this situation.”He added, ""So Aaron Rodgers cannot walk into these teams like he's MVP Aaron Rodgers, you cannot. So when you go meet with the Vikings or you go meet with the Steelers, the mindset you have to have is: What y’all need? That's it. What y’all need?”Several teams in need of a quarterback could be interested in acquiring Aaron Rodgers for the 2025 season, including the Tennessee Titans, Las Vegas Raiders, and Pittsburgh Steelers. With his extensive experience and established legacy, Rodgers will likely have no trouble securing a new team to play for next year.Aside from his deteriorating play on the field, Aaron Rodgers has also been regarded by some as a possible distraction off the field, given his past history of issuing provocative and controversial remarks unrelated to football. Through the years, his pronouncements on such social and political topics have drawn public attention and controversy, making some wonder if he is able to focus and exert his influence in the locker room.Also read : ""I have nothing but respect”: Tyrod Taylor shares candid thoughts on Aaron Rodgers and leading the Jets in 2025 With these dynamics in place, it will be interesting to see how the mesh of his struggles on the field and off-field scandals will affect Aaron Rodgers as he tries to extend his playing career in the NFL.
