MOHALI: Trouble mounted for dismissed Punjab police DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu as in a fresh development, the vigilance bureau registered a case against him and his mother Sukhwant Kaur for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.The action stems from a wider probe linked to the controversial interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi recorded while he was in custody of Punjab police.According to vigilance officials, DSP Gursher Singh earned approximately Rs 26 lakh over three years, but investigations revealed that he spent around Rs 2.59 crore in the same period — an amount nearly 10 times his official income.The case was registered by the flying squad of Mohali, and multiple raids are underway to apprehend him. However, sources in vigilance bureau suspect that Gursher has fled abroad.This new case adds another layer to legal troubles of the former police officer, who was dismissed from service in Oct 2024 after being booked for fraud, forgery, and corruption. His pre-arrest bail plea was rejected in January this year by a local court, after which he went untraceable.Gursher, known as an ""encounter specialist"" during his tenure with Mohali Police, is facing serious allegations of extortion, land fraud, and abuse of official position.He is accused of buying disputed land parcels at throwaway prices and selling them at inflated rates, as well as filing false complaints through proxies to extort money from victims.One such victim approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, which subsequently ordered the registration of an FIR against him. The case includes charges under Sections 419, 465, 467, 468, and 471 of the IPC, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gursher is alleged to have played a key role in facilitating televised interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi at the CIA staff office in Kharar. At the time, Gursher was serving as DSP (investigation), Mohali, and was frequently stationed at CIA office in Kharar.The interview caused a political and public uproar, prompting intervention from the high court, which led to his dismissal from service and suspension of seven other police officials. The vigilance bureau has intensified its manhunt for Gursher and is expected to widen its probe into his financial transactions, real estate dealings, and possible overseas links.",DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu and his mother Sukhwant Kaur are accused of possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

Immediately after taking off from Delhi in the early hours of June 14, a Vienna-bound Boeing 777 got stall warning. It also got ground proximity warning system’s (GPWS) don’t sink caution, asking pilots not to lose altitude as the aircraft operating as AI 187 had witnessed altitude loss of about 900 feet during climb.Luckily, pilots recovered the aircraft from this precarious situation and safely proceeded to the destination. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the incident; have already summoned AI’s head of safety for this case and both the pilots have been taken off flying duty pending the investigation.According to flight tracking sites, the B777 (VT-ALJ) took off at 2.56 am on June 14 in bad weather. Delhi was witnessing a thunderstorm that time. “The aircraft was involved in an inflight occurrence of stick shaker and GPWS caution. Soon after takeoff, stick shaker warning and GPWS don’t sink caution appeared. Stall warning came once and GPWS caution came twice. There was an altitude loss of around 900 feet during climb.Subsequently, the crew recovered the aircraft and continued the flight to Vienna,” said officials aware of the incident.Stick shaker refers to the control column on the flight deck shaking and making a noise to indicate something is not right and that the pilots’ attention to the situation is urgently required. In this case the pilots did that and saved the day. The flight landed safely in Vienna after 9 hours and 8 minutes. After this technical halt in Europe necessitated by longer routes taken these days due to enroute airspace closures, the aircraft then proceeded to Toronto with another set of crew members.However, the flight report for Delhi-Vienna sector only had the “stick shaker due turbulence after takeoff mentioned and not the other occurrences in detail,” said officials. When authorities examined the B777’s flight data recorder (DFDR), possibly as part of the enhanced surveillance ordered by the DGCA after AI 171 crash, the other occurrences of GPWS don’t sink caution and stall warning appearing came to light, they say.An AI spokesperson said: “Upon receipt of the pilot's report, the matter was disclosed to DGCA in accordance with regulations. Subsequently, upon receipt of data from the aircraft's recorders, further investigation was initiated. The pilots have been off-rostered pending the outcome of the investigation.”Both the pilots have been off rostered (taken off flying duty) pending investigation. The regulator has taken a very stern view on the June 14 incident. It is learnt AI head of safety was summoned on this issue.Following AI 171 crash, the DGCA had on June 17 raised “concern regarding recent maintenance-related issues” reported by Air India and directed the airline to strictly focus on safety while “strengthen(ing) internal coordination across engineering, operations, ground handling units.”Multiple industry insiders said: “Old Air India (PSU time) did not have comfortable planes running on time but safety was never an issue. Now planes, at least the narrow body fleet, are better but passengers are apprehensive about safety after the terrible AI 171 crash. The new management and the new owner need to win back passenger and employee trust at the earliest by doing all it takes.""",A Vienna-bound Boeing 777 got stall warning.

"Deal deadline 8 days away, US talks stay deadlocked",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-deadline-8-days-away-us-talks-stay-deadlocked/articleshow/122168388.cms,"Even at 10% base tariff, Indian businesses will be better off than their competitors: Officials

NEW DELHI: With eight days to go for US to restart reciprocal tariffs, there appears to be a stalemate in India-US trade talks, with New Delhi hardening its position on offering duty concessions on agricultural products.Although the Indian team led by chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal has stayed back in Washington for talks with American officials, the absence of a deal by July 8 will expose exporters to 26% reciprocal tariff. US president Donald Trump has indicated that an extension of the suspension is unlikely.The Americans are very keen to get India to lower duties on maize, soybean, dairy products, apples, and other fruits and nuts - a tough ask for the Narendra Modi govt, given the dependence of a large number of small farmers on these products, and the likely political noise over the concessions. The govt has refused to open the agriculture and dairy sector as part of free trade agreements with Australia and the UK and has conveyed its reluctance to the European Union too.But the US has asserted that any deal without lower duties on agricultural products was not acceptable, even if the opening up was for limited quantities, known as quotas in trade parlance.Indian negotiators are also worried that in return for concessions on automobiles and whiskey, they are not receiving sufficient benefits for products such as garments, home textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, and auto components.In fact, there are fears that some of the auto parts and iron and aluminium items may continue to attract sectoral tariffs, which face additional sectoral tariffs of 25% or 50%, depending on the item.Despite the divergent positions, both sides are working on a mini-deal in the run-up to the first tranche of the bilateral trade agreement by Fall (Sept-Oct), the deadline set by Modi and Trump when they met earlier this year.During a meeting with exporters on Monday, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal did not completely rule out the possibility of a deal over the next few days, suggesting that sectors that may get left out in the first round should not lose hope as more items will be added later.While the Americans have virtually ruled out lowering tariffs to zero, at least immediately, officials have told exporters that even at 10%, which is the base tariff imposed by Trump, in case of a deal, Indian businesses will be better off than their competitors who will face reciprocal tariffs.Privately, several industry representatives have met the commerce department brass and suggested that India should agree to the demands from the Trump administration, but govt is keen to ensure that it is not a one-sided deal.For Trump too, showing success through agreements with countries such as the UK, China and India is critical to get the others to the negotiating table. Last Thursday, after the pact with China, the American president had announced that a ""very big deal"" with India was expected.","The Americans are very keen to get India to lower duties on maize, soybean, dairy products, apples, and other fruits and nuts.

"Post Op Sindoor, India to fast-track launch of 52 defence surveillance satellites",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-op-sindoor-india-to-fast-track-launch-of-52-defence-surveillance-satellites/articleshow/122149971.cms,"'Jo Hume Chhedega…': PM Modi’s Speech on Operation Sindoor Cut Short by Audience. Here's Why

Poll Do you support India's initiative to launch 52 dedicated satellites for armed forces? Yes No

NEW DELHI: With the need for ‘deep’ as well as ‘persistent’ surveillance of enemy territory being reinforced by Operation Sindoor , India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.Phase 3 of Space-Based Surveillance (SBS) programme, which was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in Oct last year at a cost of Rs 26,968 crore, involves the construction and launch of 21 satellites by Isro and 31 by three private companies.The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end, as part of the project being spearheaded by Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) of defence ministry.“Work is underway to compress these timelines to launch the satellites faster into the low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit. The three private companies that have got the contracts have been told to speed up building of the satellites,” a source told TOI.“The aim of SBS-3 is to cover much larger areas of China and Pakistan, as well as the Indian Ocean Region, with shorter revisit times (interval between two consecutive surveillance sweeps of the same location) and much better resolution.The space doctrine is also being fine-tuned,” he added.Parallelly, IAF is pursuing the case for three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft, which are basically unmanned aerial vehicles or ‘pseudo-satellites’ that operate in the stratosphere for long durations on ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, as reported by TOI earlier.During Operation Sindoor, which saw intense hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, India used domestic satellites like Cartosat, as well as foreign commercial ones, for tracking military movements in Pakistan. “We need to shorten our OODA (observe, orient, decide and act) loop. The faster India gets the 52-satellite constellation up in space the better,” another source said.India also needs to put in place its satellite shield since China is developing weapons like direct ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare equipment, and directed energy weapons like high-powered lasers to contest or deny other nations access to the space domain.China’s military space programme has expanded from operating just 36 satellites in 2010 to over 1,000 by 2024, with 360 of them dedicated to ISR missions.At a seminar earlier this month, IDS chief Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit had stressed the need to extend India’s “surveillance envelope” while underlining the critical role of “real-time situational awareness” in conflicts.“We must detect, identify and track potential threats not when they approach our borders, but when they are still in their staging areas, airfields and bases, deep within an adversary’s territory,” he said.China’s creation of PLA Aerospace Force in April last year underlined its recognition of space as the “ultimate high ground” in modern warfare. “Their satellites have recently demonstrated sophisticated ‘dogfighting’ manoeuvres in LEO, practising tactics designed to track and potentially disable adversary space assets. They have evolved from a ‘kill chain’ to a ‘kill mesh’ — an integrated network that seamlessly interweaves ISR satellites with weapon systems,” Air Marshal Dixit said.","India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine. The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122149969,imgsize-1325035,width-400,resizemode-4/122149969.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Most parts of India are likely to receive above-normal rainfall in July, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday, warning of potential flooding in Uttarakhand and Haryana. With monsoon activity intensifying, authorities have been urged to monitor river catchment areas closely and remain on alert for landslides and waterlogging, particularly in vulnerable states like Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttarakhand.Addressing a virtual briefing, IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra outlined the core areas expected to receive intense precipitation this month. These include:""We should monitor the catchment areas of rivers such as the Godavari, Mahanadi and Krishna,"" Mohapatra said. ""ur models show a high probability of above-normal rainfall in the upper Mahanadi catchment, which includes Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. There are several other rivers in the region. We must closely watch rainfall activity and the water levels in reservoirs.""The northeast, large parts of eastern India, and the extreme southern peninsula are expected to see below-normal rainfall. Temperatures are likely to remain normal to below normal in most areas, although above-normal maximum temperatures may affect parts of the northeast, northwest, east, and south.In Himachal Pradesh, the IMD has issued an orange alert for Kangra, Mandi, Sirmaur, and Shimla districts, and predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated locations. Over the past 24 hours, Pandoh (Mandi) recorded the highest rainfall at 130 mm, followed by Mandi town (120 mm) and Sunni (113 mm) in Shimla.Senior IMD scientist Sandeep Kumar Sharma confirmed that rainfall activity will remain high until July 1, after which intensity is expected to taper off slightly. However, intermittent moderate showers will continue across the plains and mid-hill districts until July 6.So far, Himachal has recorded 34 per cent above-normal rainfall for the monsoon season, with Mandi, Solan, and Hamirpur districts reporting particularly high figures. Tribal districts Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti, however, remain in a rainfall deficit.In Uttarakhand, heavy rainfall has triggered landslides along the Yamunotri National Highway, blocking sections of the road and damaging essential infrastructure. Superintendent of police Sarita Dobhal visited the landslide zones and reviewed safety protocols.The Barkot-Yamunotri road, severely damaged after a cloudburst near Barkot, was partially repaired. The incident killed two workers and left seven others missing. The Char Dham Yatra, which was briefly suspended due to weather warnings, has now resumed.Electricity and water supply were affected in areas of Tehri Garhwal, including Agrakhaal, Chamba, and Jakhindhar.In Jammu & Kashmir, the Chenab River continues to swell due to relentless rainfall over the past week, forcing authorities to open multiple spillway gates of the Salal Dam in Reasi. Local residents in low-lying areas like Talwada, Chinka, and Jendi have been advised to move to higher ground and avoid riverbanks.River rafting has been suspended, and NHPC teams, along with local officials, are on round-the-clock patrols.DIG Shridhar Patil of the Doda-Kishtwar-Ramban Range acknowledged the risk. ""All of you must have noticed that the water level has risen in the Chenab River. One incident has also come to our notice in the Doda district, in which some people have lost their lives. I appeal to all people not to go near the rivers... The water level is very high. Do not put yourself at risk,"" he told ANI.","Most parts of India are likely to receive above-normal rainfall in July.

NEW DELHI: General Upendra Dwivedi is now on a four-day trip to Bhutan to further enhance the already close bilateral military ties, which come at a time when China continues to strengthen its military infrastructure in the Doklam plateau that saw a 73-day face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies in 2017.The Army chief will call on Bhutanese King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and hold wide-ranging talks with Lt General Batoo Tshering, the chief operations officer of the Royal Bhutan Army, during the visit.Gen Dwivedi will also interact with senior officials of the Indian embassy, the Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) stationed in the country, and Project Dantak of the Border Roads Organisation, which is engaged in the construction of roads and other developmental work there.“The visit reflects the deep-rooted and time-tested ties between India and Bhutan and reaffirms India’s commitment to a close and trusted partner,” Army spokesperson Colonel Nishant Arvind said.India has been keeping a close watch on the series of border talks between Bhutan and an expansionist China in a bid to resolve their territorial disputes, which include the Doklam plateau in the west and the Jakarlung and Pasamlung valleys in the north.Ever since India’s military confrontation with China in April 2020, after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh, the Indian Army has also been shoring up defenses in the strategically vulnerable Siliguri Corridor, or `Chicken’s Neck,’ the narrow strip of land in north Bengal that connects the northeast with the rest of India.The PLA has steadily stepped up its activities and infrastructure development in the Bhutanese territory of Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, which witnessed the 73-day face-off between the rival troops in 2017.Indian troops had then blocked PLA attempts to extend their motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks the Siliguri Corridor. After the disengagement, the PLA has constructed a lot of military infrastructure and permanently deployed troops in north Doklam, as reported by TOI earlier.",General Upendra Dwivedi is on a four-day trip to Bhutan to further enhance the already close bilateral military ties.

NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, Railways will soon prepare reservation chart (of confirmed berths/seats) eight hours before scheduled departure of trains instead of the present four hours. To facilitate passenger convenience, for trains departing before 2pm, the reservation chart will be prepared at 9pm the previous evening.Railway Board proposed the changes last week and railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has directed their implementation ""in a phased manner so that there is no disruption"". The board will come up with the roll out plan soon.In an official statement, the ministry said the current practice of preparing reservation charts four hours before train departure creates uncertainty in the minds of passengers. The new timeline will greatly help them with waitlisted tickets. They will get the first update on waitlist status well in advance. It will especially benefit passengers travelling from remote locations or suburbs of major cities to catch long distance trains. It will also provide more time to make alternative arrangements in case the waitlisted ticket is not confirmed, the statement said.In another passenger-friendly move, the railways announced complete revamp of passenger reservation system (PRS) by Dec.The new PRS will allow over 1.5 lakh ticket bookings per minute, around five times more than the current capacity of 32,000 tickets per minute.Under the new PRS, ticket inquiry capacity will increase 10-fold - from 4 lakh to over 40 lakh enquiries per minute. The system will also have a multilingual and user-friendly booking and inquiry interface. The decisions were made at a review meeting chaired by Vaishnaw last week. Officials said the project has been under execution by Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) over the last few months.""In the new PRS, users will be able to submit their choice of seat and see the fare calendar,"" said an official.

The system is seen as a vital step in bolstering India’s layered air defence capabilities.The Indian Air Force is seeking approval to procure three Intelligence, Surveillance, Targeting and Reconnaissance (I-STAR) aircraft. These planes will be sourced from international manufacturers and later modified by DRDO’s Centre for Airborne Systems, in collaboration with private sector partners. The aircraft will enhance battlefield awareness and precision strike capability.The Indian Navy has proposed induction of pressure-based moored mines developed by DRDO, aimed at countering enemy submarines and surface ships in strategic waters.The plan to modernise 84 Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter jets, already approved in principle, is expected to come up for further consideration. The upgrade will include avionics, weapons systems, and electronic warfare capabilities.The Navy is also pushing for unmanned underwater drones to strengthen undersea warfare and surveillance capabilities.The meeting marks the first major DAC session since the launch of Operation Sindoor, India’s counter-terror and strategic surveillance initiative, and underscores the government’s urgency in enhancing its defence posture amid evolving security challenges.Once cleared, the acquisitions are expected to significantly boost India’s operational readiness and reflect a continued emphasis on both indigenisation and technological upgrades in defence.","The defence acquisition council (DAC) is poised to clear a massive set of proposals worth over Rs 1 lakh crore aimed at modernising India's armed forces.

Rail fare hike for AC & non-AC classes kicks in from today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiked-train-ticket-fares-kick-in-from-today/articleshow/122169997.cms,"NEW DELHI: The hike in passenger fares will come into effect Tuesday after the railway ministry notified the revised fares for both AC and non-AC classes. The new fares will not apply for tickets issued at pre-revised rates, meaning passengers who booked tickets before Tuesday won't have to pay any extra charge.While fares have increased by 2 paise per km for passengers travelling in AC classes, the hike for non-AC class is 1 paisa per km. A rough calculation shows that one-way travel in 3AC in Rajdhani trains from Delhi to Mumbai, Kolkata or Patna would get costlier by Rs 20-30, while a non-AC journey in mail and express trains would cost around Rs 10-15 more. There is no hike in fares for trains on the suburban rail network and monthly season tickets for both suburban and non-suburban trains. Similarly, there is no increase in fares for passengers travelling in second class on ordinary (non-mail or express) trains for distances up to 500km. Beyond this, they will have to pay extra half a paisa per km. Passengers of ordinary sleeper class and first class in non-mail or express trains will also have to pay half a paisa more per km from Tuesday.""The fare revision also applies to premier and special train services, such as Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, Vande Bharat and Tejas, and ordinary non-suburban services,"" the ministry said.As per estimates based on the Budget document, which projects passenger km, railways were likely to earn an additional Rs 1,100-1,200 crore due to the fare hikes in the entire financial year.

CEC allays oppn fears of Bihar 'disenfranchisement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-allays-oppn-fears-of-bihar-disenfranchisement/articleshow/122169585.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Monday stepped forward to allay the opposition's fears regarding ""disenfranchisement"" on account of the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll, saying the objective of the exercise is to simply ensure that no eligible voter is left out, while also keeping the roll free of any ineligible voter.This is in line with the duty cast upon the Election Commission by Article 326 of the Constitution, which requires only an Indian citizen above 18 years of age and ordinary resident in that constituency, unless disqualified, to be enrolled. Kumar told TOI EC is deploying over 1 lakh volunteers to assist the elderly, sick, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and other marginalised groups in filling up their enumeration forms.In a statement on Monday, EC reiterated that over 4.9 crore electors included in Bihar's electoral roll from 2003 - when the last such intensive revision was conducted - need not submit any document other than their filled-up enumeration form. The 2003 roll will be treated as probative evidence of eligibility, including presumption of Indian citizenship unless any input is received otherwise.They only need to verify details from the 2003 roll - now uploaded on the EC website and hard copies of which are being provided to booth level officers (BLOs) - and return the filled-up enumeration form to the BLO.Even children of these 4.9 crore electors will only have to submit their own citizenship proof from a list of 11 specified documents, and not any documents related to the birth of their parents. ""This is because any children born to parents included as electors in the 2003 Bihar roll are Indian citizens by birth,"" said an EC official. ""Thus, nearly 60% of Bihar's (current) 7.9 crore electorate, would not have to submit any documents. ""Stating that revision of electoral roll is mandatory prior to parliamentary/assembly election or bypoll, EC said it has been conducting annual summary revisions for 75 years. Nine intensive revisions were undertaken between 1952 and 2004, involving an average six-year gap, but the latest was pending for 22 years.""SIR is required as the electoral roll is dynamic and changes due to deaths, shifting of people due to reasons such as migration due to occupation/ education/ marriage, and addition of new voters who have turned 18 years old,"" said the officer.As per Census 2011, there were 454 million migrants in India, up from 315 million in 2001. Even as per the Migration in India Report, 2021, the percentage of migrants in the population was estimated at around 29%, which is more than the winning margin in many of the constituencies.""SIR will introduce complete transparency in the additions/deletions in the electoral rolls through active participation of booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by political parties,"" the officer said, and added that around 1.5 lakh BLAs, including over 47,000 deployed by RJD alone, will monitor each stage of SIR. Interestingly, even as RJD is opposing SIR, its MLA from Hathua Rajesh Kushwaha has released posters educating electors on how to ensure they are enrolled.","Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar stepped forward to allay the opposition's fears regarding ""disenfranchisement"" on account of the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll.

"Aadhaar gaps, deviation from syllabus raise CUET concerns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aadhaar-gaps-deviation-from-syllabus-raise-cuet-concerns/articleshow/122169488.cms,"NEW DELHI: Even as CUET-UG 2025 results are awaited, the conduct of the exam has raised concerns over biometric verification gaps, shift-wise disparities and deviations from the syllabus. These have drawn criticism from candidates, parents, and experts, who say the exam fell short on basic fairness, syllabus integrity, and identity verification protocols.Adherence to protocols had been explicitly recommended by a govt-appointed high-level committee headed by former Isro chief K Radhakrishnan. One of the committee's core recommendations was multi-stage candidate verification, including Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, to prevent impersonation. National Testing Agency (NTA), in response to queries from TOI, accepted that biometric authentication of all candidates was not done at centre entry gates. Instead, the agency said, Aadhaar details were validated during online application process for 96% of the 13.54 lakh registered candidates, and that biometric data and photographs were captured inside exam halls due to time constraints between shifts.The agency said ""for CUET-UG 2025, Aadhaar validation was performed when candidate's name, date of birth, & gender matched during e-registration"".This indicates that photographs of candidates were not matched with Aadhaar data either at time of registration or during the exam, raising apprehensions of impersonation. This approach also resulted in a verification gap for the remaining 4% of candidates.Another concern is uneven shift-wise distribution of candidates, which could undermine percentile-based normalisation process. For instance, based on attendance documents accessed by TOI, physics paper had nearly 5,000 candidates in one shift and 570 in another, with similar variations seen in mathematics & general aptitude. While NTA did not provide subject and session-wise data, it said ""sample sizes were sufficiently large"" and cited the English test, for which around 43,000 candidates were accommodated in each shift.This raises a critical statistical issue: normalisation assumes comparable cohorts. If sample sizes differ across shifts, percentile rankings may not accurately reflect relative difficulty levels.On syllabus front, for physical education, the syllabus uploaded by NTA states candidates should, while naming their sport, opt for ""one of your choice"" for Unit 3. However, students reported that the questions were mandatory with no options available.While NTA maintains that CUET-UG 2025 was conducted ""successfully"" with approximately 78% attendance, several of these issues have cast doubt over the agency's capacity to uphold fairness, transparency, and comparability for the exam."," CUET-UG 2025 has raised concerns over biometric verification gaps, shift-wise disparities and deviations from the syllabus.

After the spate of reports on fake doctors and those practicing without the requisite qualification or training, hospitals are struggling to verify the credentials of those they hire in the absence of a streamlined registry that reflects all the qualifications of a doctor and details of who have been blacklisted or penalised.Almost five years after National Medical Commission (NMC) was constituted, it has managed to verify only a few hundred out of the estimated 13 lakh plus doctors practicing in India.In a bid to get the register updated, the commission put out a notice in Sept last year asking all practising doctors to register again with National Medical Register.

"Happy to be his wingman, says Papa, Shux’s backup astronaut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/happy-to-be-his-wingman-says-papa-shuxs-backup-astronaut/articleshow/122168763.cms,"'Papa' (Below right)

Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, known fondly as Papa, may not be aboard the International Space Station (ISS) this time, but he’s soaring with pride. As the designated backup to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux), who is currently making history as the first Indian to fly to the ISS, Papa says he’s happy to be his wingman.The camaraderie runs deep between the two IAF pilots, both trained test pilots, who were selected for India’s human spaceflight programme under Gaganyaan. Their journey together over the last ten months has not only forged a powerful professional bond but will also shape India’s future human spaceflight.“Shux is a fantastic guy,” Papa said ahead of Shux's docking, in a video shared by Axiom Space. “We met a few years ago through our work as fighter and test pilots. I’m actually nine years older than him… Over the last ten months of training, it’s been deeply satisfying for me to be his wingman — if I may use a bit of fighter pilot lingo.”Papa speaks of Shukla with admiration, highlighting his razor-sharp focus. “Once he decides on a goal — like becoming the first Indian to reach the ISS — he clears out all distractions and gives it his all. And that’s exactly what’s got him there.”Yet, Papa’s own path has been no less significant.As Shukla’s backup, he trained alongside him every step of the way. That training, Papa believes, has not only prepared both of them for individual missions but has also laid a broader foundation for the future of Indian spaceflight.“It never felt like work. It was more like one big, exciting picnic, though a professional one,” he says, describing the extensive, rigorous training that involved collaboration with Axiom Space, Nasa, ESA, SpaceX, and other international partners. “To train with legends like Peggy Whitson was just marvellous.”He recalls the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) training experience in the US with particular fondness. “We kayaked through rough weather, survived with limited resources, and what we learnt was this: your real strength in space is your teammate.”That, he says, is the very essence of space missions. “It’s not just about knowing someone’s strengths, but also their limitations so that you’re ready to step in, support and cover. That’s what makes a crew solid.”Among his favourite parts of training? The food. “An army marches on its stomach, and astronauts too fly on theirs,” he jokes. “The space food training was a highlight for me.”While Shukla currently has the nation’s gaze, Papa is quick to acknowledge the collective spirit behind their journey. “I want to give a big shout-out to my Prime Minister, Isro chairman, my wife Leena, daughter Nandini, and my parents. And of course, to all my fellow Indians.”Though grounded for now, Papa’s eyes remain on the skies. While Papa is happy to play wingman on this mission, one has to wait and see if may be in the pilot’s seat when India launches Gaganyaan.","Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, known fondly as Papa, is the designated backup to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux) Shux is currently making history as the first Indian to fly to the ISS.

Juliana Marins fell 2000 feet during volcano hike as family accuses rescue team of delay

“If they had reached her within the estimated seven‑hour window, Juliana would still be alive.”

“Juliana suffered serious negligence from the rescue team… Now we will seek justice for her, because that’s what she deserves.”

A former Chelsea player has made a kind offer that is warming hearts worldwide. The story begins with a young Brazilian dancer falling down a volcano in Indonesia. Now, Alexandre Pato wants to help the grieving family. The scene moves from a mountain in Asia to Brazil, and it's all tied around a charitable action that few expected from an athlete. Let's check out the complete story to see which individuals are involved, and what, exactly, has taken place.On June 21, 2025, Juliana Marins, a 26-year-old dancer from Niterói, Brazil, was climbing Mount Rinjani, a 3,726-metre volcano in Lombok, Indonesia with a group of friends. Juliana Marins fell an estimated 600 metres (approximately 2,000 feet) into a crater and was trapped, according to Indonesian Search and Rescue authorities.After four days of search and rescue operations using drones, helicopters, and ground teams on 22-25 June, Juliana's body was found on 24 June.The family has said that rescue efforts were delayed and accused local authorities of “serious negligence”.In turn, Alexandre Pato, who had a short loan spell at Chelsea in 2016, contacted them on June 26 to offer to help. He said he would handle the process of sending Juliana's body back home to Brazil.Alexandre Pato, 35 and working as a sports commentator, felt it was something he could do to try and lighten Juliana's family's load in such a tragic circumstance.Juliana’s sister, Mariana, told Brazilian media that the guide left Juliana behind when she felt tired—and that when rescuers finally got to her, it was too late. She said,The family posted online:Alexandre Pato, hearing of the heavy cost of repatriation (estimated around BRL 100,000, or £13,000), contacted Juliana’s father to offer financial support. It is not yet clear if the family has accepted his help.Juliana was known for her vibrant personality on social media. In a video filmed just before the hike, she and a friend joked about the cloudy view at the summit. “The view is amazing,” her friend said.

'Will not rest till Bihar becomes developed state': Who is Chirag Paswan targeting - opposition or Nitish Kumar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/give-me-victory-i-will-give-you-developed-bihar-who-is-chirag-paswan-targeting-opposition-or-nitish-kumar/articleshow/122164497.cms,"""I want to contest assembly polls for the sake of Bihar - to realise my dream of Bihar First, Bihari First.""

""I would not contest the election from Bihar, but for Bihar.""

""Will not rest till Bihar becomes a developed state.""

NEW DELHI:These remarks from LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, who has announced his decision to contest the Bihar assembly elections later this year, interestingly sound more like an opposition leader than an ally of the ruling coalition. Chirag, who is a Union minister in the Modi government, has not joined the Nitish Kumar government, but is part of the NDA in Bihar.Bihar has been ruled by the NDA, which comprises the BJP , JD(U) and other smaller parties including the LJP, most of the last 20 years under the leadership of Nitish Kumar. There were times in between when Nitish, who is called the Palturam of Bihar politics, switched sides and formed government with the RJD and Congress. But all these experiments were short-lived.So, why is Chirag Paswan seeking votes to build a ""developed Bihar."" Is he targeting the opposition RJD and Congress or is he making a pitch against Nitish Kumar, who has been at the helm in the last two decades.Chirag has also claimed that ""hurdles are being put in his way.""""Many people are jittery that I want to come to Bihar. Hurdles are being put in my way. But I am not going to dissuaded. Earlier attempts to break me by causing a split in my party and a rift in my family have failed to dishearten me,"" the LJP leader has claimed in his various speeches.So, the big question is ""Who is jittery? Who is trying to put hurdles in his dream for ""Bihar first, Bihari first""?Well, certainly not the opposition Mahagathbandhan of RJD and Congress. The track record of Chirag Paswan in assembly elections has been anything but impressive. Let's analyse the results of 2020 assembly elections and some of the remarks made by Chirag then to understand who could be jittery of him.Chirag, who in 2020 called for Nitish-free Bihar and coined the term ""Asambhav Nitish"", had this to say after the last assembly elections: ""It was my aim to dent JD(U) and I worked on it. I also focused that we should not affect the BJP and asked my workers to support it. My aim was to provide more seats to BJP and damage to JD(U). The LJP will improve its performance in 2025.""In 2020, Chirag's party contested 137 seats but could win just one. Its candidates finished second in nine constituencies. However, by cutting into the votes of Nitish Kumar's party, it ensured that for the first time the BJP with 74 seats became the senior partner of the coalition in Bihar and JD(U) with only 43 seats was pushed to being a junior partner.In the run up to the 2020 elections, the BJP kept Chirag away and included his uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, who had rebelled after the death of Ram Vilas Paswan and split the party into two. However, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got back Chirag into its fold and dumped his uncle Pashupati.That move gave boost to political career of Chirag, who went on to win all the 5 Lok Sabha seats that his party contested as part of NDA. Now, with Chirag staking claim for a greater role in the run up to the assembly elections, his target is obvious. That the BJP will emerge as the largest party in the ruling NDA is a given. What will be interesting to see is how much can Nitish Kumar's JD(U) gain this time? Or does it slide further?Several state BJP leaders have maintained that the Bihar elections will be fought under the leadership of Nitish Kumar. The BJP realises the importance of having Nitish on its side in the elections. The caste survey that Nitish got conducted has proved that the Bihar chief minister has the backing of the largest group of voter base in the state. However, this still does not guarantee that Nitish Kumar will be made the chief minister again by the coalition partners.However, political analyst Kumar Vijay feels that this time around Chirag may not be successful as he was five years ago as he is a part of the coalition and also Nitish and his close aides are ready for the challenges within. He also feels that Chirag's claim of Bihar first Bihari first may not have many takers.""In the last Lok Sabha elections, Chirag gave tickets to many of his relatives ignoring the party cadres. So his claim of Bihar first and Bihari first is now being viewed with suspicion. Also, unlike Lok Sabha polls where PM Modi's campaigning helped all allies in Bihar, Chirag and his party are likely to get limited advantage by virtue of being NDA ally,"" said Kumar Vijay, who has followed Bihar politics closely for several years.""Chirag Paswan is an example of caste pressure group which dominates today's politics. He has following in his caste group and that may help him to some extent,"" Kumar Vijay says.If Chirag Paswan ends up winning some seats, the road ahead for Nitish Kumar could be difficult. A weakened JD(U) will see the Bihar chief minister losing his bargaining power. More so, in the light of his reported health issues, which has been raised by the opposition time and again.","LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan has announced his decision to contest the Bihar assembly elections later this year. He is a Union minister in the Modi government, but is part of the NDA in Bihar. Is he targeting the opposition RJD and Congress or is he making a pitch against Nitish Kumar, who has been at the helm for two decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122165250,imgsize-53764,width-400,resizemode-4/122165250.jpg"

HYDERABAD: The death toll from the massive explosion at a multi-storey chemical plant in Telangana's Medak district climbed to 35 by Tuesday morning, with several workers injured and many still unaccounted for.Rescue operations are ongoing, and officials fear the toll may rise further as teams continue to sift through the rubble in search of those possibly trapped beneath the collapsed building.The government area hospital in Patancheru, where post-mortem examinations are being conducted, confirmed 35 deaths so far.The workers at the plant hail from multiple states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.Following state health minister Damodar Raja Narsimha's directives, health authorities dispatched forensic doctors to the area hospital. The Forensic Science Laboratory is supporting with DNA analysis.Close to 200 personnel from fire services, SDRF, and NDRF teams are conducting rescue operations at the site.The early morning blast reduced the building to rubble at the Rs 500-crore Sigachi Industries facility.Initial findings suggest a dryer malfunction in the quality control unit triggered the blast. “General manager A Loganan, in charge of attendance, also died. This makes it difficult to determine who was in the building,” a fire official said. Loganan had just stepped out of his car when the explosion struck the factory, about 50km from Hyderabad.An adjacent HR block and a rear compound wall were partially damaged. Chunks of cement crushed some workers, while others suffered fatal burns as flames spread rapidly after the blast. Many bodies were burnt beyond recognition. Only four bodies have been identified till late Monday.PM Narendra Modi expressed condolences and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.Distraught relatives waited outside hospitals and at the blast site, hoping for newsas authorities struggled to trace missing workers. “Lack of accurate information from the company management on how many workers were inside has complicated rescue efforts,” director of fire services G V Narayana Rao said. “More could be trapped under the debris. Only once the rubble is cleared will we have a clear picture.”Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy will visit the hospital and meet victims’ families Tuesday. He directed the health minister, chief secretary and DGP to oversee rescue and relief efforts. A fivemember committee was formed to investigate the cause of the explosion and recommend preventive measures.Sigachi Industries, which manufactures microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), informed stock exchanges about an “accident in the vicinity” of its plant in Medak district.",The death toll from the massive explosion at a multi-storey chemical plant in Telangana's Medak district climbed to 35 by Tuesday morning.

NAVI MUMBAI: The urban malaise of loneliness, depression, and distrust badly affected a 55-year-old man from Juinagar, Anup Kumar Nair, who locked himself in his flat for over three years. He only communicated with the outside world by ordering food online.After receiving a distress call from a Good Samaritan about Nair's situation, social workers of Social and Evangelical Association for Love (SEAL) rushed to his flat at Gharkool CHS, Sector 24, and managed to barge inside his ""messy"" apartment.Nair, who earlier worked as a computer programmer, lived alone in that flat which was littered with human waste.His mother, Poonamma Nair, worked in the Indian Air Force (telecommunications branch), while his father, V P Kutty Krishnan Nair, was employed at Tata Hospital, Mumbai.Since both parents passed away in the last six years, and his older brother committed suicide 20 years ago, Anup slipped into depression and refused to venture outside his flat, said Pastor K M Philip of SEAL.Philip added: ""We were shocked to see that Nair would only sleep on a chair kept in the living room because most of his furniture seems to have been taken away by someone.He also had a leg infection which requires urgent medical treatment. Some of his relatives tried to contact him following the death of his parents, but Nair does not seem to trust anyone. He is currently kept at our SEAL Ashram in Panvel.""Nair's next-door neighbour, Vijay Shibe, who is also the chairperson of Gharkool CHS, said: ""He [Nair] would rarely open his flat door... He would not even take out his garbage, so we society members had to sometimes persuade him to help us take his trash out. We also helped him to transfer the fixed deposit of his parents to his account.""When TOI spoke to Nair at the Panvel rescue centre, he said: ""I don't have any friends at present, and my parents and brother already died.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports.

Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath has declared that traditional four-year college degrees are becoming obsolete, emphasizing that lifelong learning is now the only essential skill for career survival. His warning comes as the World Economic Forum 's Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts massive disruption in the global workforce by 2030, with 92 million jobs set to disappear while 170 million new roles emerge.""The days of 4-year college courses are over. Lifelong learning is the new norm, for everyone,"" Nikhil Kamath stated on social media, responding to projections that show technology will handle 34% of workplace tasks by 2030, up from just 22% today.The WEF report reveals a stark reality: 39% of current core skills may become outdated by 2030, with countries like Egypt (48%), UAE (41%), and India (38%) facing the highest skill obsolescence rates. Despite this looming crisis, one in nine workers—approximately 11% of the global workforce—will receive no upskilling training by the decade's end.The automation wave threatens traditional roles including cashiers, clerks, and secretaries, while creating massive demand for farmworkers, software developers, and delivery drivers. The green transition alone is expected to generate over 34 million new agricultural jobs.According to the report, the top 10 fastest-growing skills include AI and big data expertise, cybersecurity, technological literacy, and creative thinking.

However, 41% admit they will eliminate roles that cannot adapt to technological demands.While 75% of companies express confidence in developing their current workforce, 38% harbor doubts about new graduates' capabilities—highlighting the growing disconnect between traditional education and market needs.

Investment will continue, with or without Microsoft: Softbank CEO

How to detect hidden cameras in a hotel room, just with your smartphone

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The Japanese tech conglomerate has been expanding its partnership with OpenAI this year, including joining the $500 billion Stargate project.During the meeting, the Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son also revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had once asked SoftBank for a $10 billion investment before Microsoft signed its now well-known partnership with the AI firm. “I said, yes, I would,” Son told shareholders. But Altman eventually went with Microsoft.The software giant recently lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI and hasn’t approved a reported restructuring plan to make OpenAI a traditional for-profit company.Despite the changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, Masayoshi Son said SoftBank’s commitment remains firm. The company earlier stated it might reduce its stake if OpenAI doesn’t restructure by December 31, but Son clarified on Friday that their support will continue “regardless of what happens with Microsoft.”Son said OpenAI is key to SoftBank’s vision of building the world’s largest ASI platform. He reportedly aims for the company to become the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era” within the next decade.SoftBank owns Arm, the UK-based chip company, and recently acquired U.S.-based chip designer Ampere for $6.5 billion. It is also reportedly exploring the creation of a $1 trillion AI-focused industrial complex in the United States.","SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX is under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) following a recent crane accident at the company’s Starbase, Texas, facility. The crane collapse was captured in a livestream by Lab Padre on YouTube, a channel focused on SpaceX. The video of the same was also shared on the social media platform X. Clips of the incident were widely shared across social media platforms.According to a report by CNBC, it was not immediately clear if any SpaceX workers sustained injuries as a result of the incident. Neither Musk nor other company executives have responded to requests for comment from the publication.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for OSHA informed CNBC that additional details will be made available once the investigation is complete. The incident reportedly occurred while the crane was involved in cleanup efforts following a recent Starship explosion at the site. Take a look at the video here:Previously, SpaceX has been said to have faced scrutiny over its workplace safety record, which has reportedly exceeded the industry average in terms of injuries. In one 2014 incident, employee Simon LeBlanc died due to a hazard the company failed to address, according to OSHA.These developments come as SpaceX continues to face operational challenges, including a recent crane collapse and several explosions involving its Starship Super Heavy launch vehicle—the rocket intended to support Musk’s long-term goal of Mars colonisation.Environmental groups in the US and Mexico have reportedly criticised the impacts of these incidents on local ecosystems, though SpaceX claims recent activities caused no harm.Starship is also tied to NASA’s Artemis mission to return humans to the moon. However, uncertainty around NASA’s upcoming budget—which is pending congressional approval—may affect upcoming collaborations with SpaceX.The Musk-led company has secured over $20 billion in federal contracts to date, mainly from NASA and the Department of Defence, the report adds.","OSHA is investigating a crane accident at SpaceX's Starbase, Texas, facility.

(AI image)

Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

On June 30, spot gold traded between $3,248 and $3,300 as the metal took support around $3250 for the second day in a row.

The metal fell overnight on reduced safe demand due to the Iran-Israel ceasefire and trade deal optimism. However, the metal recovered in the European session and was stable in the US session on the Fed rate cut notions as US yields eased further.

Markets look for more than 50 bps cuts ahead this year as US data, especially job data, are turning out to be disappointing amid somewhat contained inflationary pressure.

Earlier, spot gold slumped 2.79% in the week ending June 27 on reduced safe haven demand and healthy risk appetite.

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold price prediction today: Gold is expected to trade with a slightly bearish bias, analysts feel, considering the diminishing geopolitical tensions and positive talks of trade deals ahead of US President Donald Trump’s tariff deadline. What is the gold price outlook for the coming days?Markets are hopeful that the US will be able to finalize trade deals with several nations ahead of the July 9 deadline as talks with India, Japan and many other nations continue, while reportedly, the US is close to clinching deals with Mexico and Vietnam. In addition, the EU is hopeful of reaching some sort of trade agreement with the US before the deadline.President Trump said that he will not need to extend the pause on tariffs which are to take effect from July 9 as he intends to send a very fair letter to each country regarding their tariff rates.US data released Monday were weaker than expected as MNI Chicago and Dallas Fed manufacturing Activity both trailed the forecast.China's home sales slump continued in June as the value of new-home sales from the 100 largest property companies stood at 339 billion Yuan, a 23% decline from a year ago. China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs (June) came in at 49.70 (forecast 49.60) and 50.50 (forecast 50.30) respectively as composite PMI improved from 50.40 to 50.70.US Senate Republicans are committed to meet the July 4 deadline to pass legislation that contains $3.80 billion tax breaks and spending cuts. The Senate is beginning an all-day session of amendment votes on Monday in which democrats may block any provisions that may increase costs for working families or small businesses as they remain concerned about the possibility of the bill increasing the deficit. The House may vote as soon as Wednesday provided the Senate can pass the bill. Democrats maintain that Trump's tax breaks are adding to the national debt.US data on cards today include ISM manufacturing (June), S&P global US manufacturing PMI, construction spending (May), and JOLTs job openings (May).China's Caixin PMIs (June) will also be in focus.The week is data-packed with crucial US data like ISM manufacturing (June), ADP employment change (June), nonfarm payrolls (June) and ISM Services Index (June).Treasury Secretary Bessent said it would not make sense to increase sales of longer-term securities at current yields as expects the whole yield curve to shift down as inflation falls. He said that some of the Fed officials already serving at the Federal Reserve are under consideration to head the central bank.On June 30, the US Dollar Index fell to 96.85, a fresh cycle low marking the lowest level since February 2022. At the time of writing, the Index was hovering around 96.87, down nearly 0.50% on the day.The ten-year yields at 4.23% were down around 1% as the yields hover around 2-month low. 2-Year yields at 3.72% were down around 3 bps.As of June 27, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 90.61MOz, highest since August 2023. ETF holdings are up 9.36% YTD as the ETFs recorded net inflows for the second straight month. ETFs were on track of recording a monthly inflow of more than 2 MOz after a decline of 0.68 MOz in May -- the first monthly decline this year.COMEX gold inventory stood at 37.048 MOz, which is down around 25% from the record high level of 45.072MOz seen on April 4, as buyers opt for physical delivery.In the post-war Bretton Woods era, the stock of gold held by central banks peaked at 38,000 tons in the mid-1960s. Their reserves are approaching the historic high as the reserves reached 36,000 tons in 2024.In the very short-term, tariff news flows and risk appetite will be the most important factors governing gold prices . As such the yellow metal is well supported on huge ETF inflows, a weakening US Dollar, investors opting for physical delivery, rate cut expectations and a shaky Iran-Israel ceasefire deal. However, presently, investors are focused more on trade deals and expectations of a pickup in corporate earnings as Q2 results will start pouring in soon.In all possibility, the July 9 trade deal deadline will get extended as trade negotiations are likely to extend further. Deadline extension would be a bearish development for the yellow metal.In such a scenario, barring re-eruption of geopolitical jitters and trade frictions, gold is expected to trade with a slight bearish bias.It may decline to $3228 (MCX August gold contract Rs 94,100)/$3200 (Rs 93,300) in the very short-term; however, medium to long term prospects remain quite bright. Interim support is at $3247 (Rs 94,700). Resistance is at $3310 (Rs 96,600)/$3322(Rs 96,900)/$3350 (Rs 97,700).","Spot gold fell overnight on reduced safe demand due to the Iran-Israel ceasefire and trade deal optimism.

KOLKATA: Monojit Mishra, the key accused in the campus rape case, reportedly controlled 10 to 15 admissions each year, with the going rate ranging from Rs 50,000 to a couple of lakhs. Sources said his muscle power on campus stemmed from his financial clout.Current students of the law college recalled seeing Monojit, also known as 'Mango', standing near a tea stall by the college gate or under a nearby tree, striking up conversations with candidates during admission season.""When I came to this college to take my admission, I met Monojit at the tea stall. He told me if I knew anyone seeking to study law, I could connect the person with him. The amount would be Rs 50,000 to a couple of lakhs,"" said a student, now in second year.Another second-year student, Vaagmi Trivedi, said, "" Monojit controlled 10 to 15 admissions a year in exchange for money. Students have to rank within 500 in the law entrance tests to get admission. But we have students with ranks even higher than 2,000 in the general category taking admission."" Case in point, said students, was Zaib Ahmed, the second accused, who ranked 2,634 in the law entrance test.Another law student shared Mango played a proactive role in ""backdoor admissions"". ""He fixed rates for backdoor entry, charging Rs 50,000 to Rs 1-3 lakh. Students who got seats this way became Monojit's followers. These admissions took place parallelly with the regular process. Sometimes, after the first round was over, the seats left vacant were filled with 'backdoor entries'.""A girl pointed at the tea stall. ""They'd hang out there and prey on desperate students with poor ranks, promising them seats at a price. Some of them would, in turn, play the same role the following year, continuing the cycle of exploitation,"" claimed the girl, adding Monojit also collected money from students for cultural programmes and fests and there were several financial irregularity cases against him.An insider pointed out admissions for money had always been there. ""The official number of seats is 120. But at least 10 to 15 more seats are sold for a huge sum. Mango was ousted from the college TMCP unit in 2021 and in 2022, corruption allegations were raised against other TMCP unit members. The unit was dissolved and Mango was unofficially given charge of the college in 2023. His job of an ad-hoc staff in 2024 was to control college affairs and admissions,"" the insider said.","Mojit Mishra, the key accused in the campus rape case, reportedly controlled 10 to 15 admissions each year, with the going rate ranging from Rs 50,000 to a couple of lakhs.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court warned the state govt that it would summon the chief secretary over its ‘lethargic approach’ in finalising new rules for recruitment, promotion and transfers in the Telangana fire services department.While giving a ‘final opportunity’ to the govt to complete the process by July 16, a division bench of the high court said it would be constrained to summon the chief secretary if the rules were not framed by then.“If by that time, the rules are framed, his (chief secretary) presence may not be required,” the bench said on June 16.The bench noted that during the earlier hearing of the matter on April 21, 2025, the court was informed that a draft of the proposed rules was prepared and was under departmental approval. Taking this into account, the court granted the govt almost two months to complete the process.However, during the hearing on June 16, when the state counsel sought one more adjournment of around four weeks, the bench remarked that the govt has not moved an inch forward. The counsel produced a correspondence made by the special chief secretary to the govt with a request for taking one more adjournment of about four weeks without there being any strong ground.“Seeking such a request itself clearly indicates the lethargic approach at which the govt is functioning,” said the bench.The petition was filed by three fire department employees challenging the AP Fire Services Subordinate Service Rules issued in 1992 and urged the rules be set aside to make way for the new service rules to be made under the Telangana Fire Services Act.","The high court warned the state govt that it would summon the chief secretary over its ‘lethargic approach’ in finalising new rules for recruitment, promotion and transfers in the Telangana fire services department.
