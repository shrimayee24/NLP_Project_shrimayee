"Banda District: Once a drought-hit district, UP's Banda gets top national award for water conservation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/once-a-drought-hit-district-ups-banda-gets-top-natl-award-for-water-conservation/articleshow/114484573.cms,"IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal receives the best district (north zone) award for UP's Banda district from President Droupadi Murmu in New Delhi on Tuesday

NEW DELHI: Banda district in Uttar Pradesh ’s Bundelkhand region, which was once known for drought and farmer suicides, on Tuesday bagged the best district (North Zone) national award for showcasing exceptional intiatives in water management and conservation. Also, UP has secured the second position in the state category after Odisha in water conservation and management in the country.President Droupadi Murmu honoured UP with the second place and Banda with the best district (north zone) award during the 5th Rashtriya Jal Puraskar-2023 in New Delhi on Tuesday.Welcoming the awards, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath posted on X, “Under the guidance of respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, many unprecedented works are being done in the direction of ' Jal Shakti ' in Uttar Pradesh. This achievement is the result of the Uttar Pradesh government giving priority to water conservation, management and public participation. Heartiest congratulations to the people of the state and all those involved in this sacred work of water conservation and promotion!”Each and every house in around 18,000 villages of UP have received drinking water supply under the government’s Har Ghar Nal Scheme.IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal , who was till recently Banda DM, received the award on behalf of the district. Chief development officer of Banda, Ved Prakash Maurya, was also present at the award ceremony.“Honoured to receive National Water Awards first prize from Hon’ble President of India for district Banda under best district category. Grateful to have been a part of Team Banda and to drive the mission to transform Banda from water scarce to water surplus district,” DM Nagpal posted on X. Nagpal, who is currently Lakhimpur Kheri DM, had worked as Banda DM for over 14 months during which she took several big initiatives for water conservation and management.The barren and hilly region of Banda, with difficult topography and sparse vegetation, made it difficult for groundwater re-harvesting. Though the average rainfall in the Bundelkhand district in the year 2019 was 902 mm, it was higher than that of Punjab and Haryana, 636 mm and 563 mm, respectively. Despite low rainfall, the two northwestern states could tackle the water crisis because of rainwater harvesting. Bundelkhand, on the other hand, lagged on that front.However, several efforts were taken by the UP government over the past several years for water conservation in the district. Under these programmes, 405 ponds of the district were revived and 4,690 soak pits constructed, and sprinkler & drip irrigation systems were being used for farming, which saved a lot of water. Initiatives were also taken for mapping of ponds, check dams and other water structures. A massive tree plantation drive was also undertaken for water conservation.The Aviral Jal Abhiyan is also being run in Banda district in which awareness campaigns are being run regularly and workshops are being organised to increase people's participation.IAS officer Heera Lal , who was the DM of Banda from August 2018 to February 2020, had also played a significant role for water conservation in order to change the lives of people in the drought-hit district during his tenure. Speaking to TOI, Heeral Lal, who is currently special secretary in the irrigation department of the UP government, said, “During my tenure, 2,200 private wells and over 2.200 government wells were desilted and over 1,000 wells were dug up.” He had suggested shaft digging near wells or hand pumps to conserve rainwater and pushed for a massive tree plantation drive. “Trees help us store and conserve water. Hence, plant as many trees as possible in your vicinity,” he used to tell villagers. For the best district award to Banda, Heera said, “The credit goes to people as they continued the water conservation efforts even after my transfer.”",Banda district in Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand region bagged the best district (North Zone) national award for showcasing exceptional intiatives in water management and conservation.

""However, there was a slight improvement in MDDF from the National Family Health Survey-3 when 87% of this age group were MDDF to 77% as per the NFHS-5 conducted in 2019-2021,"" said author Gaurav Gunnal from the International Institute for Population Sciences , Deonar.Maharashtra, along with seven other states including UP, Rajasthan, and Gujarat, had high MDDF of over 80%. Only 95 districts in the south, east, and the northeast out of India's 707 districts had a low prevalence of dietary failure at 60% and lower.""Dietary failure was higher among children who were females, from lower socio-economic groups, did not receive food from anganwadi centres, and were born to younger mothers,"" said Gunnal and co-author Dhruvi Bagaria from Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar.

Therefore, to prevent further deterioration of air quality, the CAQM sub-committee… has taken the call to invoke the 11-point action plan as per Stage-II of the revised GRAP in entire NCR,” said.The curbs do not allow use of portable DG sets below 19KW, permitting them only for emergency use, as at present there are no specific means to control emissions from this category of machines. The rule, however, also states that DG sets between 19kW to 63kW, if not retrofitted or functioning on dual fuel, will only be permitted for emergency services –such as hospitals, lifts, etc. – if there’s no gas infrastructure in the given region.Earlier, on October 15, CAQM imposed Stage I restrictions when the city’s AQI turned 'poor'.On Monday, the share of stubble burning in the region’s pollution load increased to around 3.2% from 1.8% a day earlier.

(Reuters)

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: Canadian NDP MPs speaking during an emergency debate in parliament on foreign interference from the Indian government in Canada have called for the RSS to be designated a terrorist organisation in Canada, for BJP officials who have called for racist and genocidal violence to be banned from the country, an end to sharing information, prohibiting the sale of Canadian arms, and for sanctions against India.MPs in the Canadian House of Commons spoke on Monday night about how Canadian Sikhs felt frightened and many had even had extortion calls, had their homes shot at, and some had had to spend thousands of dollars on security or were living in hotels owing to threats from criminal gangs.Liberal MP Ruby Sahota MP said: “I have had constituents come to me with videos of FaceTime calls from leaders of gangs sitting in prisons in India. How does that happen? How are people who are imprisoned in India contacting my constituents in order to extort them through local gang organisers in this country? There has to be foreign interference involved.” She agreed that “those who are in violation of human rights should not be let into this country”.New Democratic Party (NDP) MP Heather McPhersen called on Canada to stop selling arms to India, a ban on entry for BJP officials from India who have called for race violence and genocidal violence against minorities, and for sanctions on India.Liberal MP Randeep Sarai said: “I think all tools are at the disposal of government and should be used.” He said the first measure was expulsion of Indian diplomats and “more measures will be forthcoming… The world should unite against any government that ever thinks or tries to act in such a manner,” he said, referring to allegations by the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) that agents of India’s government were involved in multiple homicides and extortions.In the debate, which went on until midnight, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said: “We should be pausing information sharing with India. We should not be giving intelligence regarding Canadian citizens to a country and a government alleged to have hired gangs to commit violence against Canadians for over a year.” He also said: ""There is a violent, extremist, right-wing organisation known as the RSS… it is very divisive, and it has branches across the world, including here in Canada. It needs to be banned.”Hindu and Sikh Canadian MPs were united in condemning India’s alleged actions in Canada, which Delhi denies.Liberal MP Randeep Sarai said: “To Hindu Canadians I want to be unequivocally clear. This is not a Sikh or Hindu issue. This is an issue of Canadians versus government of India… Foreign interference from India is at all-time high and far exceeds that from China, Russia, or Iran.”The political parties each blamed each other for the rise in foreign interference in Canada.Conservatives and NDP blasted Liberals for taking four years to set up a foreign agent registry. The Liberals accused the Conservative leadership race of Indian interference.Conservative MP Jasraj Singh Hallan said: “Extortions are up. Violent crime is up. All these things have been happening because of soft-on-crime policies. That is the reality of living in Canada today.” He said “everything is politics” to the Trudeau government, blaming them for voting against his party’s extortion bill.Extortion has gone up 360 per cent , homicides are up 28 per cent , violent crime is up 50 per cent , and violent gun crime up 116 per cent under Trudeau’s leadership. “The Liberals’ policies fostered this environment,” said Conservative MP Arpan Khanna.","MPs in the Canadian House of Commons spoke on Monday night about how Canadian Sikhs felt frightened.

Secularism means live and let live, says SC

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday argued for retention of madrassas and reform of their education system before the Supreme Court and said striking down of the UP Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 by Allahabad high court was wrong even though the state had accepted the verdict and not appealed against it.Acting on a bunch of appeals, the SC on Apr 5 stayed the March 22 judgment of the high court which had held the Act to be violative of principles of secularism, and directed the state to admit more than 12 lakh students studying in 13,364 madrassas in regular schools recognised by the state education board.To a question from a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, additional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for UP govt, said the state had defended the validity of the Act but accepted the verdict of the constitutional court.""It is our legislation. The state has wide powers to regulate and reform madrassa education,"" said the ASG.The high court should not have struck down the Act. It could have examined the validity of certain provisions in the light of Article 21A and Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009,” he said.The bench agreed with him and said, “The state has a vital interest in mainstreaming madrassas; otherwise how do these institutions produce worthy citizens if they are not acquainted with math, science and other mainstream subjects? We will interpret the Act that way. But to strike down the Act entirely is akin to throwing the baby with bath water.”The bench’s view synced with the arguments of madrassas and different Muslim organisations. Senior advocate A M Singhvi pointed out that if the state was keen to reform madrassa education, it should not have sat on Madarsa Board’s Oct 2021 decision to include elementary mathematics and science in classes up to secondary level till date.Supporting HC’s decision, advocate Guru Krishna Kumar argued that UP Board of Madarsa Education Act, being based solely on religion, is non-secular. The CJI said, “India is essentially a religious country. Can religious instructions not be regarded as education? Is it in national interest to ban madrassas, or should they be mainstreamed? People will send their children to madrassas even if they are not recognised. It would be for state to regulate madrassa education to mainstream the syllabus.”The bench said, “We must look at the broad sweep of the canvas. Religious instructions are not confined only to Muslim community, it is there in every religious community. India is a melting pot of cultures. Let us preserve it that way. Secularism means live & let live.”","Supreme Court stayed the March 22 judgment of the high court which had held the Act to be violative of principles of secularism.

Son’s IAS dream shattered in Kashmir; Karva Chauth turns to mourning in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sons-ias-dream-shattered-in-kashmir-karva-chauth-turns-to-mourning-in-jammu/articleshow/114437131.cms,"Photo/Agencies

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: Amid grief and disbelief, two families — one from Kashmir ’s Budgam district and the other from Jammu — find themselves bound by an unimaginable tragedy. What was meant to be a festive time of Karva Chauth for architectural designer Shashi Bhushan Abrol’s wife and children, and a hopeful return to routine life for Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar’s family, has now become a period of mourning and shattered dreams.Sunday’s terrorist attack in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district robbed them of their loved ones, plunging moments of joy into an abyss of sorrow. Abrol and Dar were employees of construction company APCO Infratech and among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.In Naidgam village of Budgam, the air was heavy with grief as 52-year-old Dar was laid to rest in his ancestral graveyard Monday. His family — his mother, wife, and three children — remained stunned by the loss. “My son, where have you gone?” wailed his mother.One of the most heartbreaking moments came from his teenage son Mohsin Dar, who revealed how his father had been his greatest supporter. “I wanted to become an IAS officer , and he had promised to help me fulfill this dream. Now that dream is gone,” he said.The timing of the physician’s death added another layer of heartbreak — just days earlier, he had celebrated the wedding of his daughter. He had been scheduled to return home to Budgam to participate in after-wedding ceremonies, but fate had other plans.The loss has shaken the entire community. “Dr Sahib was a man of honour, a professional who served us with humility and faith,” said Ghulam Mohammad Dar, a local elder. “We were just celebrating his daughter’s wedding, and now we’re mourning his death.”The village condemned the attackers and called for justice. “This loss is not just personal; it is a blow to humanity,” said a resident. “The ones responsible must be brought to justice.”Over 300km away, the Abrol family in Jammu is grappling with the same nightmare. Shashi Abrol’s wife Ruchi had kept a Karva Chauth fast, praying for her husband’s long life. But instead of breaking her fast with a loving conversation, she received news of his death.Ruchi, her voice choked with grief, recounted her last conversation with her husband. “He called me in the evening, and everything seemed normal. I told him I would call again after finishing the temple rituals. But after that, his phone went silent.”It was only late that night — as Ruchi eagerly waited for a video call from her husband to break the fast — that the family learned of the tragedy through media reports. “We were all trying to comfort her, but we had no idea what had happened,” Ruchi’s sister-in-law Divya said.Married for 20 years, Shashi leaves behind his parents, wife, and two children.The family is left with not only their grief but also practical challenges. “Shashi was the sole breadwinner,” said his father Jagdish Raj Abrol. “His wife is a simple housewife. How will she raise the children alone?”Divya said Shashi’s dream was to see his son become an engineer. “He last came home two months ago to help with his son’s engineering college admission. His biggest hope was to see him succeed, but now everything is uncertain.”In the midst of their pain, the Abrol and Dar families shared the same plea: that those responsible for this tragedy be held accountable, and that the government extend support to help them rebuild wrecked lives. Still, they know no amount of justice can replace the fathers, sons, and husbands they lost — men whose love, dreams, and hopes for their families were stolen in a moment of senseless violence.","Shashi Bhushan Abrol and Dr Shahnawaz Ahmed Dar were among the seven killed at the Z-Morh tunnel campsite on the Srinagar-Leh highway.

I would truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you and gain your insights on the issue, as I believe your experience and guidance would be invaluable,"" he added.The father further appealed to the Union Home Minister to spare a few minutes for a brief meeting. He said: ""Please let me know when and where you can spare a few minutes for us. Then, we can keep ourselves prepared. I appreciate your time and consideration of this request and look forward to your favourable response... I look forward to the opportunity of meeting you,"" he added.Earlier, the mother told news agency PTI, that she was quite hopeful about securing an appointment with the Union home minister. She intends to personally appeal to him for guidance in their pursuit of justice.“I am hopeful that Amit Shah ji will give us some time. I will tell him the mental agony we have been going through because our daughter is yet to get justice,"" she said.On August 9, the body of a post graduate female trainee doctor was found in the seminar hall of RG Kar Hospital. In response to which thejunior doctors across West Bengal initiated a 'cease-work' protest, demanding justice for the victim, increased police presence in hospitals, the hiring of permanent female police officers, and the prompt filling of vacant positions for healthcare professionals.After 42 days of protest, the junior doctors ended their demonstration on September 21, following assurances from the state government to address their demands. However, they resumed their agitation on October 5, launching a fast-unto-death after the Mamata government failed to meet their 24-hour deadline to fulfill the demands in response to the rape and murder of a woman medic at RG Kar Hospital.Earlier on Monday after a meeting with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee they ended their hunger strike on the 17th day.

Sikh businessman had praised Modi’s outreach to secessionists

Two local criminals of Canada, arrested on charges of killing Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik - a rival of slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar - have pleaded guilty in a Canadian court, confirming a gangland killing angle. Malik was an accused in the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight (named after Kanishka) that killed 329 people, but was acquitted for lack of evidence.Malik was shot dead on July 14, 2022 by Tanner Fox (23) and Jose Lopez (25), local goons with a history of run-ins with the law.Less than a year later, Nijjar, initially a suspect in Malik's killing, was shot and killed on June 18, 2023, in Surrey, British Columbia.Fox and Lopez pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Malik amid high drama in court where they attacked each other, said local reports. They filed their pleas in British Columbia Supreme Court on the eve of their trial for first-degree murder.Malik, local media said, had annoyed Nijjar and his aides by appealing for reconciliation with the Indian State.Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik had praised PM Modi’s outreach to those who wished to disengage with secessionists.A probe by Canadian Police in 2022 had revealed that Nijjar was in a legal dispute with Malik over the issue of the printing of the Sikh holy book — Guru Granth Sahib — in Surrey in violation of a religious edict issued by Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal seat. Malik’s son had filed a lawsuit against Nijjar to reclaim a specialised printing press. According to local media reports, Malik and his associate Balwant Singh Bandher had entrusted the press to Surrey’sGuru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Aug 2020.Fox, from Abbotsford in British Columbia, hails from a town plagued by gang violence. His criminal record dates back to Nov 2019 when Abbotsford Police arrested him, then 19, for a parking lot stabbing incident involving a 17-year-old victim. He was sentenced to four months in prison besides two years of probation. Fox was out on bail in another offence at the time of Malik’s murder. Lopez was also convicted with a 18-month sentence in Sept 2019 on charges of assault and use of weapon for an incident in Abbotsford reported in 2018.Malik (75) was shot several times in his car outside his family business. The Canadian Police had also zeroed in on two suspicious vehicles — a burnt car and another which was supposedly the getaway vehicle used by the assassins after the murder. The modus operandi involving a “car on fire” was reminiscent of several gang-related killings in the area in the recent past. It was employed also in the killing of one Gagandeep Sandhu (29) who was shot dead in his car in Burnaby area around the time Nijjar was killed.","Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik had praised PM Modi’s outreach to those who wished to disengage with secessionists.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi burst into laughter when Russian President Vladimir Putin , on a lighter note, said that their relationship is such that PM Modi may not need any translation to understand his words.""We have such a relationship that I felt that you do not need any translation,"" said Russian President Vladimir Putin at the bilateral meeting with PM Modi.Russian President Putin welcomed PM Modi with a hug and a handshake.

As I have said earlier, we believe that the problems should be resolved in a peaceful manner. We fully support the early establishment of peace and stability. All our efforts give priority to humanity. India is ready to provide all possible cooperation in the times to come,"" PM Modi said.Over the last quarter-century, Brics, an acronym initially coined by a Goldman Sachs economist, has evolved from a grouping of emerging market economies into a potential challenger to the Western-led global order.The key focus of this Brics summit in Kazan is to explore how Brics can continue to push for a multipolar world order—one that challenges the dominance of the US and the Western-led global financial system.Brics represents a significant portion of the world’s population and economic output, with its members accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global population and around 25 per cent of global GDP .","Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in Russia's Kazan for the summit on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Striking a note of caution a day after the India-China agreement on ""patrolling arrangements"" was announced, General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday said the two armies are trying to "" restore trust "" and ""reassure each other"", which when fully achieved should lead to disengagement , de-escalation and de-induction of troops in eastern Ladakh .The Army chief's remarks come even as Indian and Chinese military commanders on the ground are working out the modalities for the resumption of patrolling, which will be coordinated to prevent any possibility of the rival troops confronting each other, and the subsequent disengagement and verification process at the major face-off sites in Depsang and Demchok.The government, however, has refused so far to answer queries on whether China has extracted concessions on some patrolling rights in Arunachal in lieu of the agreement finalised for eastern Ladakh.General Dwivedi, on his part, said India's position from the very beginning has been on the need for China to restore the status quo along the Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) as it existed before the People's Liberation Army's multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.""Thereafter, we will be looking at disengagement, de-escalation and normal management of the LAC. And this normal management of the LAC will not just stop there. There are phases in that also,"" the Army chief said, after delivering a lecture at defence think-tank USI.""As of now, we are trying to restore trust. It will get restored once we are able to see each other and we are able to convince and reassure each other that we are not creeping into the buffer zones that have been created... (the resumption of) patrolling gets you that kind of advantage and that is what is commencing. And, as we restore trust, the other stages will also follow through,"" he added.India and China had earlier established no-patrol buffer zones, varying from 3-km to 10-km, after troop disengagements on both banks of Pangong Tso, including the Kailash range, Galwan Valley and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, with the last happening in Sept 2022. But the buffer zones have largely come up in areas that India considers its territory.With the disengagement now slated for the strategically located Depsang Plains and the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok, a senior officer told TOI that India should guard against ""Doklam being repeated"" in eastern Ladakh. ""Trust but verify. China should not be allowed to change facts on the ground and then present them as a fait accompli,"" he said.There was a 73-day face-off on the Bhutanese territory of Doklam in 2017 after Indian troops blocked Chinese attempts to extend its motorable track towards the Jampheri Ridge, which overlooks the strategically vulnerable Siliguri Corridor. After the disengagement, the PLA constructed massive military infrastructure and permanently deployed troops in north Doklam.The massive way in which China has strengthened its forward military positions as well as built ""permanent defences"" and infrastructure all along the 3,488-km LAC over the last four years, especially across eastern Ladakh, the PLA is unlikely to return to its peacetime locations anytime soon. ""The entire process of disengagement, de-escalation and de-induction, if it actually happens on the ground, will take months,"" the officer said.","General Upendra Dwivedi said the two armies are trying to "" restore trust "" and ""reassure each other"" The Army chief's remarks come even as Indian and Chinese military commanders on the ground are working out the modalities for the resumption of patrolling.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114479738,imgsize-1664081,width-400,resizemode-4/114479738.jpg"

The good thing is that we fought for a good cause. If playing in the Olympics and winning a medal for our country is greed, then yes, I will carry that 'greed' till my last breath. What exactly is greed? If, as an athlete, speaking up for fellow athletes and standing by my sisters is greed, then I consider it a good kind of greed. The desire to play for the country should always remain,"" Phogat said.In her recently released book Witness, Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik claimed that Phogat and Punia’s decision to accept exemptions from the trials hurt their protest’s integrity. Malik, one of the key faces of the movement against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, argued that the protest began to lose credibility when people close to Phogat and Punia allegedly filled their minds with “greed.”""The old way of thinking selfishly was taking over once again. The people close to Bajrang and Vinesh had started filling their minds with greed,"" Sakshi wrote, without naming those involved. She added that their decision made the movement seem ""selfish"" and led some supporters to question its true intentions.The protest was originally aimed at removing Singh, who was accused of sexually harassing female wrestlers—a case still being heard in a Delhi court. While the ad-hoc committee running WFI granted both Phogat and Punia exemptions from the trials, Malik refused the favour and opted out of the Games. Phogat later suffered an injury, and Punia returned from Hangzhou without a medal.Malik stressed that accepting the exemptions caused divisions within the movement. ""It put us in a situation where many supporters started to think that we were actually in the protest for selfish reasons,"" she wrote.The protest culminated on May 28, 2023, when the wrestlers’ march to the new Parliament Building was blocked by police. Shortly after, both Phogat and Punia joined the Congress party ahead of the Haryana assembly elections. Phogat won the Julana constituency, while Punia was appointed head of the party’s national farmers' unit.","Wrestler Vinesh Phogat responds to claims that protest was motivated by ""greed"" Sakshi Malik claims decision to accept exemptions from 2023 Asian Games hurt protest's integrity.

Flight bomb threats: BTAC protocols tweaked in wake of hoax bomb threats to airlines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flight-bomb-threats-btac-protocols-tweaked-in-wake-of-hoax-bomb-threats-to-airlines/articleshow/114471960.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) protocols have been modified to effectively handle the ongoing wave of ""random"" online threats targeting various Indian airlines , according to news agency PTI report citing official sources.The sources informed PTI that the BTAC protocol has been adjusted, and a thorough assessment based on a new set of 'red flags' is now being conducted.The CISF and respective airline security have also been instructed to implement ""focussed"" security protocols for frisking passengers, their baggage, and the aircraft to ensure that nothing is overlooked while preparing a flight, they added.According to a senior aviation security officer, the new bomb threat assessment process has been introduced in response to the recent deluge of such messages that have affected over 140 domestic and international flights in the Indian aviation ecosystem.A second officer stated that the decision to modify and examine threat messages at the BTAC with a refined perspective was made following a recent meeting of various civil aviation stakeholders, including the civil aviation ministry, BCAS, CISF, airline and airport operators, intelligence agencies, and the police department.While security remains a top priority when such messages are received, some flag indicators used to classify a bomb threat as specific or a hoax have been modified based on an analysis of each threat's specifics and recent trends, the sources added.When it is determined that a bomb or hijack threat message posted on social media was published ""without any rationale,"" the BTAC will categorize it as ""non-specific or hoax"" to avoid unnecessary harassment and wasted time for passengers and airline crew, they explained, without providing specific details due to operational reasons.However, there will still be instances where a message or call is deemed ""specific,"" but this will not be done on a large scale, the sources noted.Previously, if the threat message contained a specific flight number, such a claim was classified as ""specific,"" and all counter-terrorist and anti-hijack protocols were activated, including diverting or emergency landing the targeted flight and subjecting the aircraft to anti-sabotage checks after landing and isolating it in a designated apron or bay, the sources explained.The passengers on the ""specific"" declared flights were held at the terminal building until their luggage and the aircraft underwent a thorough security check, and the threat was confirmed as a hoax, according to sources.The BTAC, which convenes in response to bomb threat calls to aircraft or airports, declared bomb threat messages sent to 30 flights of Air India , Vistara, and Indigo as ""hoax or non-specific"" on Monday night at seven airports across the country.The threat was deemed ""non specific"" as it was discovered that a single X handle posted these ""bombs onboard"" messages for 10 flights of each of the three carriers within a span of 56 minutes.Meanwhile, aviation security officials anticipate that these new measures will help alleviate ""some"" of the issues caused by these fake social media or phone call messages.According to a cyber security official, some of these threats originate from Internet connections activated through virtual private networks (VPNs), and many of the handles, particularly on X, were created only a few hours or days before posting the threats to various airlines. To date, approximately 20-25 such handles have been suspended or restricted.","Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) protocols have been modified to effectively handle the ongoing wave of ""random"" online threats targeting various Indian airlines.

The Commonwealth Games Federation's (CGF) decision to axe as many as 12 sports from the Glasgow 2026 programme has invited sharp response from India's celebrated coaches Pullela Gopichand and Vimal Kumar , who have urged the country to boycott the Games. Badminton , along with popular sports like hockey, cricket, wrestling, archery and table tennis, has been axed from the 2026 edition of CWG .Diving, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, mountain biking, squash and rhythmic gymnastics are other sports that have been dropped.It has come as a blow to India, who have had a rich CWG history in sports like table tennis, badminton, wrestling and hockey.""There is no need for CWG. In my opinion, they should do away with it,"" former India coach Vimal told PTI. ""It is better to organise the Olympics and Asian Games than CWG. It is pathetic, I am really disappointed. CWG is losing its charm, its relevance, so I feel strongly we shouldn't send out a team for CWG, it is not required.""""Instead of CWG it is important to look at ways to provide better facilities to athletes at the Olympics and Asian Games. CWG is not required. You have to put good physical sport in the program, if you take away all that then what's the point,"" he said.The CGF unveiled Glasgow as the host nation for the 2026 Games, which will include only 10 sports.Australia's Victoria withdrew as host last year.Gopichand also slammed the decision to drop so many sports.""I am deeply appalled and disappointed by the decision to exclude badminton from the 2026 Commonwealth Games -- a judgment that appears to be aimed at stunting the progress of nations like India,"" said the celebrated coach, who is also a former All England champion.""Badminton has brought us immense pride and success, serving as a vital platform for our brightest talents to shine on the international stage. This decision represents a significant lapse not just for Indian badminton, but for the sport worldwide, lacking clear reasoning and jeopardizing its growth,"" he added.He urged the country to stand up against the decision and voice out its disapproval. .""It is crucial that we raise our voices and bring this issue to the appropriate authorities to ensure badminton continues to thrive and inspire future generations. As the sport experiences exponential growth globally, the reasons for its exclusion must be scrutinized and discussed with the relevant stakeholders. We cannot allow such shortsighted decisions to undermine the progress we have tirelessly achieved,"" said Gopichand.The 23rd CWG will be played from July 23 to August 2 in Glasgow.","Pullela Gopichand and Vimal Kumar urge India to boycott the 2026 Commonwealth Games.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

E Coli Outbreak: Deadly E coli outbreak linked to McDonald's burger hits 10 US states: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deadly-e-coli-outbreak-linked-to-mcdonalds-burger-hits-10-us-states-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/114483137.cms,"Representtative image (Picture credit: Reuters)

Here's what you need to know:

Infections were reported in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.

One death was reported in Colorado; 10 hospitalizations, including a child with severe kidney complications.

All interviewed individuals reported consuming food from McDonald’s, primarily Quarter Pounders.

Investigators are examining slivered onions and beef patties as potential sources of contamination.

Preliminary findings suggest slivered onions from a single supplier may be linked to some illnesses.

McDonald’s has removed Quarter Pounder hamburgers and slivered onions from menus in affected states and parts of Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

The company has temporarily halted the distribution of slivered onions sourced from the implicated supplier and emphasized its commitment to food safety.

The implicated strain, E coli O157:H7, causes approximately 74,000 infections annually in the US, leading to severe symptoms including fever, stomach cramps, and bloody diarrhoea.

Young children are particularly vulnerable and can experience severe complications like acute kidney failure.

McDonald's has faced a decline in global same-store sales for the first time in nearly four years, prompting the introduction of a $5 meal deal that does not include the Quarter Pounder.

Following the CDC’s announcement, company shares dropped 9 per cent in after-hours trading.

An E coli outbreak associated with McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers has emerged as a significant public health concern, impacting at least 49 individuals across ten states. Federal health officials have confirmed that the outbreak has resulted in one death and ten hospitalizations, including a child facing severe kidney complications.The centers for disease control and prevention ( CDC ) is actively investigating the situation, which has sparked concerns regarding food safety and the fast-food giant’s menu offerings.The infections have been traced back to a period between September 27 and October 11, with the majority of cases reported in Colorado , which has logged the highest number of infections.As officials work to identify the source of the contamination, initial findings suggest that slivered onions and hamburger patties may be to blame. McDonald’s has responded to the outbreak by removing the implicated items from menus in affected states and halting distribution of certain ingredients.This outbreak comes at a challenging time for McDonald's , which has recently experienced declines in global same-store sales. As the fast-food chain grapples with the impact of inflation on consumer behavior, this health crisis may further strain its reputation and financial performance. The investigation is ongoing, with health officials urging the public to be vigilant about the symptoms of E coli infection.","At least 49 individuals were affected, with 27 cases in Colorado and 9 in Nebraska.

'Wasn't this guy supposed to be a genius?': X staff describe first meeting with Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wasnt-this-guy-supposed-to-be-a-genius-x-staff-describe-first-meeting-with-elon-musk/articleshow/114394243.cms,"X employees were left bewildered after their first meeting with Elon Musk following his acquisition of the social media platform, then known as Twitter . Described as erratic and detached from the company's core, Musk's rambling answers left many questioning whether he truly understood the business. ""Wasn't this guy supposed to be a genius?"" one employee asked after the chaotic exchange.The meeting began with Twitter’s chief marketing officer , Leslie Berland, easing Musk into a Q&A session.Her first question was simple: “Why do you love Twitter?” Musk, however, gave an answer that left many staff scratching their heads. “I find, like, I learn a lot from what I read on Twitter... It's a great way to get a message out over the phone,” Musk rambled, before veering off-topic to joke, “Some people use their hair to express themselves, I use Twitter.”Employees were alarmed by Musk’s vague responses and apparent lack of preparation. “I actually turned to a stranger in the Commons and said, ‘What is happening right now?’” an employee recalled. Despite the confusion, some, like Randall Lin, thought the reaction was overblown, suggesting, “With Elon, you kind of know what you're going to get.”When Berland pressed Musk on how Twitter employees could earn his trust, Musk dodged the question, responding with, “If somebody is getting useful things done, then that’s great. But if they’re not... why are they at the company?” His nonchalant attitude towards employee trust did little to ease concerns.The final question about whether Musk would take on the CEO role prompted a more bizarre response. Musk, who already held the title of ""Techno King"" at Tesla, dismissed titles as unimportant. Instead, he shifted the conversation to his overarching philosophy on extending the lifespan of civilization, contemplating alien life and the nature of the universe. ""Many employees were stunned by this seemingly irrelevant monologue,"" according to a former engineer, who said Musk ""either hasn't given this much thought or doesn't take this seriously.""The meeting concluded with widespread disbelief among employees. “He did not land the plane,” a former executive quipped, criticising Musk's inability to offer coherent leadership at a time of great uncertainty for the company.Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022, valued at $44 billion, led to mass layoffs, with nearly 80 percent of the staff being let go. Employees who remained were warned of ""extremely hardcore"" working conditions, as Musk set the tone for his reign over the platform now known as X.","Elon Musk met with Twitter employees for the first time following his acquisition of the social media platform.

Pakistan plans artificial rain for the second time after Lahore declared world's most polluted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-plans-artificial-rain-for-the-second-time-after-lahore-declared-worlds-most-polluted/articleshow/114472983.cms,"The Punjab province of Pakistan on Tuesday announced plans for artificial rain to help reduce the impact of smog , following an alarming Air Quality Index (AQI) of 394 in Lahore.This would mark the second time that Lahore, the cultural capital of Pakistan, would carry out cloud seeding for artificial rain, being one of the cities to face the worst pollution regularly.The cloud seeding was done for the first time in December 2023 to combat hazardous levels of smog and it cost an estimated Rs 350 million.Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.The AQI measures the concentration of different pollutants in the air, with values above 100 classified as unhealthy and those above 150 considered ""very unhealthy.""Addressing a press conference, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said, ""Yesterday Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world. We have taken a number of initiatives to address the matter and now we are planning for artificial rain in the city.""She, however, did not declare any date for it.The Punjab government , led by Maryam Nawaz, has launched the 'Anti-Smog Squad' to monitor areas affected by smog as this hazardous pollution has caused significant health problems for city residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and skin infections.These squads will be educating farmers about alternative methods for residue disposal, the hazards of burning crop residues and promoting the use of super seeders.Smog is a specific phenomenon that arises from a mixture of smoke and fog, occurring when certain polluting microparticles combine with cold, moist air and linger near the ground. This results in reduced visibility and can lead to various health problems.Previously, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had also called for ""climate diplomacy"" with India to mitigate smog impact in the province.She said that stubble burning in Punjab, India also impacts across the border because of air direction and hence both sides should make joint efforts to combat smog.""This issue needs to be taken up with India forthwith,"" she said.""Obstacles to environmental improvement must be removed. Smog causes breathing difficulties and damages eyesight,"" the CM added.Meteorology plays an important role in determining the level of air pollution in north Pakistan, just as it is a major factor in the neighbouring region of northwest India. After the rainy season crop is harvested, farmers from both sides tend to burn stubble adding to the existing causes of pollution caused due to industrial emissions and transport.Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the Environment Ministry said,""The positive effects of the measures taken to combat smog will become visible in 8 to 10 years. Environmental protection has been included as a subject in the curriculum in the province.”She also urged the farmers to avoid burning the crop residues, as it harms not only the crops but also their children's health.","Lahore was declared the most polluted city in the world on Monday with an alarming AQI of 394.
