NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday backed nationwide protests by workers and farmers demanding protection of their rights.He flagged concerns over labour reforms, trade policies, and potential changes to the rural jobs programme MGNREGA.""Workers fear that the four labour codes will weaken their rights. Farmers are apprehensive that the trade agreement will harm their livelihoods. And weakening or scrapping MGNREGA could snatch away the last lifeline of villages. When decisions affecting their future were taken, their voices were ignored,"" he said through a post on X.""Will Modiji listen now? Or is the “grip” on him too strong? I stand firmly with the workers and farmers on their issues and their struggle,"" Rahul added.An all-India general strike called by ten Central Trade Unions (CTUs) and backed by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday is aimed at opposing a range of government policies, including the four labour codes, privatisation and contractualisation measures, the Electricity Amendment Bill 2025, changes to MGNREGA and the proposed Seed Bill.Large-scale participation from farmers, agricultural workers and industrial unions is expected at protest sites across the country, with power sector employees, PRTC staff and other worker organisations also set to join.In a statement, the SKM said the strike seeks the withdrawal of the four labour codes, the Electricity Bill 2025, the Seed Bill 2025 and the VB-G RAM G Act 2025, among other demands. It also called for the restoration of the old pension scheme and the implementation of minimum wages for all workers, including scheme workers.Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) working president Binoy Viswam expressed full support for the nationwide farmers’ strike, describing it as a movement to defend people’s basic rights.Apple farmers in Himachal Pradesh have also intensified preparations to join the nationwide farmers’ strike on February 12 and announced a march to Delhi, warning that recent import duty reductions under India-US and other free trade agreements could hurt the state’s apple-based economy.They expressed concern that cheaper imports could impact local growers, despite repeated assurances from union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal that the interests of Indian apple farmers will be safeguarded.While several trade unions and farmer organisations have decided to join the strike, the National Front of Indian Trade Unions (NFITU) said it would not participate, describing the protest as “politically motivated.”","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi backs nationwide protests by workers and farmers.

Why the strike was called





Impact on key sectors





What is likely to remain open





NEW DELHI: Over 10 central trade unions called for a nationwide Bharat Bandh on Thursday against the government’s “anti-worker” policies. The bandh was supported by farmer organisations and other groups across sectors.The strike call was announced as a mark of “resistance to anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the central government.”Trade unions said nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to participate in the agitation.The protest was expected to partially affect services such as banking, insurance and transport, with unions serving strike notices across departments and industrial establishments.Also read | Bharat bandh today: Are banks shut amid nationwide strike on February 12? The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) called upon farmers to join trade union workers in making the all-India general strike a success.In a statement, the SKM said the strike sought the withdrawal of four labour codes, the Electricity Bill-2025, the Seed Bill-2025, the VB-G RAM G Act-2025, restoration of the old pension scheme and implementation of minimum wages for workers, including scheme workers.The platform of agricultural workers’ unions and the NREGA Sangharsh Morcha (NSM) supported and participated in protest demonstrations across the country.“SKM calls upon the people to resist all the new attacks launched by the BJP government on the farmers, the workers and common people,” the statement said.The SKM said the Electricity Bill would raise power tariffs for farmers and domestic users and impose peak-hour charges and smart meters. “SKM is demanding 'No to Smart Meters' and 300 units of free electricity to all as is also being promised in BJP election campaigns,” the statement said.It also opposed the Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Act, alleging that it would depose the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), and objected to the new Seed Bill, stating it would lead to black-marketing of seeds.The SKM opposed free trade agreements, calling them a blueprint of “economic colonisation” through the denial of minimum wages to workers, minimum support price (MSP) to farmers and the right to employment to unemployed youth.“The Modi government has surrendered the sovereignty and the self-reliance of India to the United States of America,” the SKM alleged.“SKM appeals to all farmers to join en masse in the protest demonstration, burn the effigies of Narendra Modi and Donald Trump and copies of the free trade agreements in solidarity with industrial workers and against all the anti-people, pro-corporate government policies,” it said.Insurance sector workers have also protested against the government’s decision to allow up to 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector and the implementation of new labour codes.“Services in electricity, banking, insurance, transport, health, education, gas and water supply will be affected due to the nationwide strike call on February 12,” All India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur told PTI.Public sector banks and insurance offices, state transport services in select states, government offices and public sector units, industrial and manufacturing hubs, coal, steel and other core sectors, mining and gas pipeline operations, and rural employment works under MGNREGA in protest areas are expected to see the impact of the agitation.However, all bank unions will not participate in the strike as their united front had already observed a strike on January 27. Bank workers’ unions such as AIBEA, AIBOA and BEFI participated in the protest.Hospitals, ambulance and emergency health services are expected to remain operational. Metro services are to function subject to local administration decisions.Private offices, IT companies, schools and colleges are likely to remain open depending on state-wise decisions. Essential supply services such as milk and pharmacies are also expected to function.",Trade unions said nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to participate in the agitation.

"Not just HCs, CJI nudges Supreme Court judges on delayed verdicts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-just-hcs-cji-nudges-supreme-court-judges-on-delayed-verdicts/articleshow/128235297.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Amid mounting unease of SC over the practice of judges inordinately delaying pronouncing verdicts reserved by them, a two-judge bench of apex court has set Thursday as the day to deliver a verdict it reserved a year and two months ago.SC had recently criticised HC judges who reserve verdict and forget to pronounce their decisions, terming it an ailment in justice system.An SC bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Manoj Misra on Dec 3, 2024 reserved verdict in the case “B Prashanth Hegde vs State Bank of India and Another” after hearing senior advocate A M Singhvi for appellant and additional solicitor general N Venkataraman. The case centred on failure to repay alleged bank dues of Rs 300cr and a counter-claim challenging the IBC proceedings. It might be a coincidence that the case showed movement soon after an SC bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Feb 3 criticised Jharkhand HC judge Rongon Mukhopadhyay for keeping judgments reserved for years.Terming it as “challenge” and an “ailment of the justice delivery system,” the CJI said such delays “must be cured and not allowed to infect the system”.When contacted for comments on his concerns over the judgment being kept reserved for long, the CJI office said, “the CJI is aware of the issue and that he is contemplating consultation with his colleagues for issuance of a general internal guidelines for prompt delivery of judgments.Overwhelming majority of judges in the SC do not keep judgments reserved for a long period. Compared to the HCs, the SC judges must get a little more time to contemplate and deliberate before delivering judgments as these become the law of the land. ”On inquiry with the SC registry, TOI learnt that Justice Misra had agreed to author the judgment on behalf of the bench and that it is pending with him for more than one year. CJI Kant had earlier said the best way to avoid reserving decisions in too many cases is to dictate the orders in the courtroom immediately after hearing the two sides to a litigation.CJI, in most cases, dictates judgments in the courtroom. Because of the pressure of administrative work that eats into his judicial time, the bench led by the CJI sits beyond the scheduled business hours to compensate the litigants and complete the day’s work, sources said.In 2001, the SC in Anil Rai case flagged the practice of some HC judges reserving verdicts and then failing to pronounce them, or issuing only the operative portions of the verdict with a promise to provide detailed reasons later — a commitment which was often observed in the breach.SC had ruled that if the judgment remained reserved for over six months, the litigants could make an application to the CJ concerned for listing the case for fresh hearing before another bench. SC could lay down guidelines for HCs, but it has done little to tackle similar delays in SC. Justice A S Oka, close to his retirement last year, had delivered the judgment on a long-pending dispute between two ISKCON factions after keeping it reserved for almost a year.","SC bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Manoj Misra on Dec 3, 2024 reserved verdict in the case “B Prashanth Hegde vs State Bank of India and Another” The case centred on failure to repay alleged bank dues of Rs 300cr and a counter- claim challenging the IBC proceedings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128235384,imgsize-50612,width-400,resizemode-4/sc.jpg"
Andrabi UAPA case stuck over jurisdiction concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andrabi-uapa-case-stuck-over-jurisdiction-concerns/articleshow/128235212.cms,"‘Does judgment include sentencing?’

NEW DELHI: Arguments on sentencing of Kashmiri separatist Aasiya Andrabi and her two associates, convicted last month under UAPA for conspiring to wage war against India and for membership of a terrorist outfit, could not begin on Wednesday as the question of jurisdiction has not yet been decided.Andrabi, founder of women separatist organisation Dukhtaraan-e-Millat, and her aides Sofi Fehmeeda and Nahida Nasreen were arrested by NIA in a 2018 case and held guilty on Jan 14 by additional sessions judge Chanderjit Singh.However, the sentencing remains stalled pending clarity on jurisdiction.The impasse traces back to Nov 2025, when judge Singh was transfersred from NIA court to Karkardooma family courts. Since the verdict in the case had already been reserved, he retained the file and convicted the trio last month.The confusion over sentencing, however, resurfaced after the matter was transferred back to Singh by NIA court judge Prashant Sharma, who had earlier held that the judge delivering the conviction should also decide the quantum of punishment. Singh had been hearing the matter since 2024 before his transfer.However, since the case falls within the NIA court’s jurisdiction, his present posting as a family court judge has added to the procedural complexity. The HC had held in another case that where a sessions case had been heard in its entirety, the predecessor judge was “duty-bound to pronounce the judgment”. The next hearing on Feb 17, 2026 will determine how to further proceed on the matter.Arguments on sentencing in Aasiya Andrabi’s criminal conspiracy case was put off as a Delhi court must first decide if judgment passed on Jan 14 includes both conviction and sentencing.

Gold price prediction

today:

are extending their rally this week, and remain well supported in the long term, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. The expert lists out the top factors that will decide direction of gold prices in the coming days:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold was seen struggling for direction this week, with overall trading activity subdued in the absence of fresh market-moving catalysts. It briefly slipped below the $5,000 psychological level during the early session today, but is still holding above the same.Global equities extending their rally this week is seen weighing on the Bullion in the near term. At the same time, a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) and softer US Treasury yields are helping to cushion the downside, keeping losses limited and keeping Gold rangebound in near term.Gold witnessed a sharp two-way move last week, initially extending its correction from record highs as profit booking, higher exchange margins and a rebound in the U.S. dollar triggered heavy liquidation, before stabilizing near key technical support around the 50-day moving average. Spot prices rebounded nearly 4% on Friday to close near $4,965 after successfully defending the $4,700–4,750 demand zone, indicating institutional buying and bargain hunting rather than panic selling, while geopolitical risk premiums eased slightly amid improving US–Iran diplomatic signals.Central Bank Demand Still Strong: China’s PBOC added gold for the 15th consecutive month, reinforcing sustained official-sector buying — a key structural pillar behind gold’s multi-year rally and a strong floor during corrections.Structurally, gold remains well supported in the long term by central-bank buying (700–750 tonnes expected in 2026), ETF inflows, reserve diversification and easing-rate expectations.The yellow metal is trying to build a base, with $5,000 now the pivotal near-term pivot, holding above it would strengthen the case for a move toward resistance at $5,090–$5,140, while failure risks a slide back toward $4,750 support.Markets are focused on US jobs and inflation data for clarity on Fed rate cuts, dollar direction, and lingering concerns over Fed independence, while continued central-bank buying, especially from China, keeps the broader bullish structure intact despite near-term range trading.Traders showed a muted reaction to the latest US Retail Sales figures, with Headline Retail Sales flat in December. Attention now turns to the delayed Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Wednesday, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on Friday.China has urged domestic banks to curb their exposure to US Treasuries on market-risk concerns, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. In response, US Treasury yields remain under pressure across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield extending its decline for a second straight day and hovering near 4.18%.","Gold was seen struggling for direction this week, with overall trading activity subdued in the absence of fresh market-moving catalysts.

"As PM Modi shifts his office tomorrow, PMO gets a new address: Seva Teerth",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-pm-modi-shifts-his-office-tomorrow-pmo-gets-a-new-address-seva-teerth/articleshow/128229842.cms,"(Photo credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: South Block, home to all major decisions in govt for over five decades, will see the prime minister’s office (PMO) move out of the British-era building on Friday afternoon and shift to the newly constructed Seva Teerth.PM Narendra Modi will chair the last Cabinet meeting in South Block scheduled on that day before the inauguration of the new administrative building, which is less than a kilometre from the iconic structure on Raisina Hill.TOI has learnt that after the Cabinet meeting, Union ministers and top bureaucrats will go from South Block to Sewa Teerth, which houses the new PMO, cabinet secretariat, office of National Security Adviser and India House, the new venue to host high-level delegations. Officials said the first Cabinet meeting under PM Jawaharlal Nehru was held in South Block.Cabinet secretariat has already shifted from Rashtrapati Bhawan to Seva Teerth-2 and the shifting of NSA’s office from Sardar Patel Bhawan to Seva Teerth-3 in the new executive enclave is underway.South Block and North Block on Raisina Hill were built in 1931. The history of PMO traces to a small PM’s secretariat (PMS) in 1947 to provide basic administrative help to the PM.The first major structural change happened in 1964 after Lal Bahadur Shastri became PM when PMS got statutory status via Allocation of Business Rules. The authority of the office increased significantly during Indira Gandhi’s tenure and in 1977 it was renamed PMO during Morarji Desai’s tenure.PMO’s shift will be followed by the ministries of defence and external affairs from South Block to multiple offices over the next few weeks. The movement to the new complex means the country's power centre is completely moving out of Raisina Hill. North Block has been vacated completely with ministries moving out of the iconic building to new buildings along Kartavya Path, which was earlier called Raj Path.","PM Narendra Modi will chair the last Cabinet meeting in South Block scheduled on that day before the inauguration of the new administrative building.

'Met Epstein 3-4 times': Harpdeep Puri sets record straight after Rahul Gandhi's charge in Lok Sabha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/met-epstein-3-4-times-harpdeep-puri-sets-record-straight-after-rahul-gandhis-charge-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/128204848.cms,"Rahul Gandhi and Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri lashed out at Lok Sabha leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi over Congress’s repeated attacks over the infamous Epstein files, saying he met Jeffrey Epstein only ""three or four times"" in a professional capacity as part of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism.Puri said the meetings took place before he joined the Union Cabinet in 2017 and are already in the public domain.""I want to remind you that today, during the Parliament session, my name was mentioned in the context of some developments elsewhere—the Epstein files. I just want to share some information... I want to clarify that these facts are all public,"" Puri said at a press conference.He futher added: ""Three million emails have been released, covering the period from May 2009, when I joined as India’s Ambassador to the UN in New York, until I became a minister in 2017. During this period, there are references to only three or four meetings, and my interactions were entirely professional"".Puri said, ""After I resigned as India's ambassador to the UN, I was invited to join the International Peace Institute (IPI) a few months later. I was not part of the IPI per se. I was secretary general of the Independent Commission (ICM) on Multilateralism, set up in the IPI as a project.""""My boss in the IPI, Terje Rod-Larsen, was the person who knew this particular infamous person Mr Epstein and it is as part of a delegation of the IPI or the ICM that I met Mr Epstein on a few occasions, three or maximum four,"" he added.Taking a vile dig at ""yuva neta"" (young leader) Rahul Gandhi, Puri said: ""Epstein Files, the Yuva Neta should know, are about wrongdoing, criminal offences. The Epstein Files are about charges that he had an island where he used to take people to indulge their sexual fantasies, charges of paedophilia, and there are victims of this. Those victims have brought cases against people in authority. My interaction had nothing to do with that. ""Amid the criticism from the opposition over the India-US trade deal, Hardeep Puri said the pact was the best given the tumultuous global situation and that it was just a trailer.Further defending India's economic growth and slamming Rahul Gandhi for echoing Trump's ""dead economy"" claim, Puri said: ""On the one hand, you have leaders who dedicate their lives to transforming the country and work around the clock, and then you have elements of buffoonery. I am choosing my words carefully, elements of buffoonery. I did not call him (Rahul Gandhi) a buffoon; I said elements of buffoonery.”The Union minister also took a dig at Gandhi's conduct in the Lok Sabha, noting, ""Today, Rahul ji was supposed to speak on the budget. While speaking, he started reading the Economic Survey. It's as if there's a pause. Hey, my brother, please read a little. It's very important for India that we have international agreements and trade agreements.""Hardeep Puri's remarks come after Rahul Gandhi alleged that he possesses verified information, saying that ""there are Department of Justice files on Epstein naming Hardeep Puri and Anil Ambani.""""There's an industrialist whose name is also mentioned, but why hasn't he been arrested? Why are you linking him? The camel is somewhere, and the dog is barking in another city. What are you linking to what? I've already said, there are elements of vulgarity in this. It's only for entertainment value,"" Puri said on Rahul's remark on Anil Ambani.""I have said that I will authenticate the data I have. There are Department of Justice files on Epstein files naming Hardeep Puri and Anil Ambani,"" Gandhi told reporters at parliament premises.Speaking with reporters outside the new Parliament building, Gandhi claimed that the names of Union minister Hardeep Puri and businessman Anil Ambani have figured in the 'Epstein Files' released in the US.He said summons have also been issued in the ongoing case against Adani and the Indian government has not responded to them for the past 18 months.""There is direct pressure on PM Modi. Without any pressure, no prime minister of India would ever compromise on matters concerning the country's farmers, data, energy security, and defence. No one would do this unless there is heavy pressure and a very chokehold over them,"" Gandhi told reporters.In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said, ""India-US Trade Deal has mortgaged the future of 140 crore Indians. Youths’ jobs are at stake, farmers’ crops are on the negotiating table, and energy security is being surrendered to the terms of a foreign country.""""No Prime Minister surrenders like this without massive pressure. India understands - this deal is not one of equals, it is one of compulsion. Whether from the Epstein files or the Adani Case - Modi ji has sacrificed national interest in his bid to save power,"" Gandhi said in his post.Meanwhile, on January 31, the ministry of external affairs spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, strongly dismissed the references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2017 visit to Israel in an email purportedly part of the recently released Epstein Files.MEA spokesperson had dubbed the reference as the ""trashy ruminations"" of a convicted criminal.","Hardeep Singh Puri says he met Jeffrey Epstein only ""three or four times"" in a professional capacity as part of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism.

What explains the Left's right turn?

Anti-incumbency

Rise of saffron wave

The ‘watershed’ local body polls

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condemned his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma's ""point-blank"" video, terming it ""communal hate mongering"". However, it was only weeks ago when he himself remained at the center of a controversy for supporting a communal statement in his state.Kerala's Left has, for decades, projected itself as an ideological outlier in Indian politics — secular, class-driven, and resistant to the communal polarisation that has reshaped much of the country.Alternating in power with the Congress-led UDF, the CPM-led LDF built its dominance on welfare politics, strong grassroots organisation, and a firm rejection of identity-based mobilisation. Yet, as the state heads toward another high-stakes electoral cycle, that self-image appears increasingly strained.Recent years have seen the Left navigating a far more complex political terrain.Anti-incumbency pressures after two consecutive terms, the steady expansion of the BJP’s footprint, and shifting demographic and electoral calculations have forced recalibration. In response, the LDF’s politics has begun to display sharper edges — marked by strategic outreach to majority sentiment, selective engagement with religious institutions and a willingness to deploy rhetoric it once distanced itself from.It is against this backdrop that a spate of communally charged statements and controversies has moved to the centre of Kerala’s political discourse. What was once confined to accusations of covert alliances and backroom deals has now acquired a distinctly communal framing, raising questions about whether the Left is merely reacting to new political threats — or consciously adopting elements of the very playbook it long criticised.Jamaat-e-Islaami Hind has once again found itself at the centre of a political storm in Kerala — but this time, the sharper focus is on the surge of communal rhetoric that has accompanied the controversy.The socio-Islamic organisation was dragged into a political spat after the CPM and the BJP accused the Congress-led UDF of accepting support from Jamaat. While Jamaat’s political wing, the Welfare Party of India, does not wield significant electoral power, it maintains a presence across social, religious and educational institutions — a footprint that often becomes politically contentious.What has amplified the row, however, is the language used in attacking the alleged association. CPM leader AK Balan made a communally charged statement while criticising the UDF, warning that if the Congress alliance came to power, Jamaat would control the state’s home ministry and that it could lead to a repetition of incidents like the Marad riots of 2002-03. The reference to a past episode of communal violence immediately escalated tensions and sharpened political divides.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not shy away from voicing his support for Balan’s remarks. But the fallout was swift. The CPM’s top leadership later attempted damage control, describing Balan’s remarks as his “personal view” after the party faced criticism for rhetoric that opponents said it echoed ""Sangh Parivar"" campaign.The Congress seized on that line of attack. “What the CM has said is a kind of communalism that even Sangh Parivar does not express,"" AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said , framing the controversy as a troubling departure from the CPM’s professed secular stance.The CPM pushed back, arguing that the debate was being deliberately mischaracterised. Party leader MV Govindan said BJP and Sangh Parivar organisations were trying to present CPM’s criticism of the RSS as an attack on Hindu believers. ""Society should understand that criticism against religious fundamentalists is not against religion,"" he said, adding that Mahatma Gandhi was a true believer and Nathuram Godse was a religious fanatic.""How can one argue that criticism against a religious fanatic is criticism against religion? CPM will continue to expose this contradiction and work among people to expose and oppose both minority and majority communal extremists,"" Govindan said.Despite defending its ideological position, the CPM eventually distanced itself from Balan’s original statement, reiterating that it reflected his “personal view.”Even as the Left sharpened its outreach to the majority community, it simultaneously moved to reinforce ties with influential Muslim bodies, most notably Samastha, signalling a calibrated dual-track political strategy.The nomination of Samastha Mushawara member Ummer Faizi Mukkam—known both for his proximity to the Left and his vocal criticism of the IUML—to the reconstituted Kerala State Waqf Board underscored this approach.Faizi’s inclusion, despite past controversies and objections from pro-IUML quarters within Samastha, was widely read as an attempt to strengthen engagement with sections of the influential Islamic scholars’ body that are either sympathetic to or seeking distance from the IUML.Communist CM Pinarayi Vijayan, far-right UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s message and a Hindu event - Kerala witnessed it all last year.The Left government in Kerala organised Global Ayyappa Sangamam. But why did it stand out? As the name suggests, the event is meant for Ayyappa devotees. Sabarimala temple, which remains controversial, earlier for restricted women's entry, and now for gold theft, is devoted to the Hindu deity Ayyappa. Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) manages the temple and organises Global Ayyappa Sangamam. However, last year, the CPM government’s move to “assist” TDB in organising the Ayyappa event raised a lot of eyebrows.Why?The Left government was upfront in supporting the SC 2018 verdict allowing the entry of women of all ages in the Sabarimala temple. It even provided police protection to the two women of menstruating age who entered the Ayyappa temple.Protests erupted. Those who opposed the move- Sabarimala Karma Samtihi and BJP among others- took to the streets.BJP even accused the Left government of using the SC verdict to “diminish the prominence of the Sabarimala temple.”BJP and RSS both maintained the stance that while they supported “equal rights for men and women to worship in all temples”, they also affirmed that “unique rituals and beliefs should be protected"".By 2019, the Left government took a U-turn. It felt that aggressively facilitating women’s entry, as the year before, could again trigger unrest and large-scale protests during the pilgrimage season. Moreover, the party leadership concluded that pushing the issue could be politically costly, especially after past backlash and violence.As a result, Left’s move to organise the Ayyappa event is seen as nothing but a “majority appeasement” move, at least by the opposition.In fact, CPM received backing for the Sangamam from influential community organisations, including the Nair Service Society (NSS)—which led the 2018 agitation against the Vijayan government—as well as the SNDP, KPMS and the Malayaraya Mahasabha.The Sabarimala gold theft case is another major corruption charge that the Left has been accused of. The case revolves around the alleged pilferage and misuse of gold from the inner shrine of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple. Moreover, the opposition has alleged that investigative lapses have allowed key accused to walk out on bail — an outcome the Congress says marks another low for the Left government in Kerala.Picture this: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor sharing a stage to mark the largest private investment in a communist state, after a slew of opposition by the locals citing environmental concerns.It was 2015. The UDF government in Kerala laid the foundation stone for the Vizhinjam port. 'Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone' (APSEZ) signed the agreement with Kerala to build the port and operate it for 60 years.LDF, which was in opposition then, had rejected what it called a ‘sell-out’ PPP framework that favoured the sole bidder, Adani Ports and SEZ.Cut to 2025. LDF government, led by CM Pinarayi Vijayan shared the stage with Gautam Adani to congratulate for the “excellent execution of this mission”.However, this change in stance wasn’t just theatrics. On the ground, too, the shift was unmistakable.Despite sustained protests by fisherfolk and environmental groups, the LDF government stood firmly behind the project.Legal challenges against the port were contested in court, but construction was allowed to proceed.Prolonged protests, including a 140-day agitation in 2022, were met with police action and criminal cases against protest leaders.Claims of coastal erosion, displacement and loss of livelihood were rejected by the government, which backed the developer’s compliance reports and pushed the project forward, even as local opposition continued.The CPM went beyond backing the project and turned its fire on the protesters themselves. Through its mouthpiece, the party branded the Vizhinjam agitation as violent, motivated by vested interests, and led by forces seeking to destabilise the region.Protesters were accused of attacking police and the media, vandalising equipment, and defying court orders, even as the government refused to pause construction.The paper insisted that most demands had already been conceded, ruled out any rethink of the project, and portrayed protest leaders as irresponsible actors prolonging unrest despite talks and assurances—effectively shifting blame from the project to those resisting it.And that’s how a communist state got its largest ever private investment.Anti-incumbency has historically been a decisive factor in Kerala politics, and the numbers from past assembly elections make clear why the Left Front is apprehensive ahead of 2026.Looking at the electoral record, the LDF has experienced sharp swings after being in power: in 2001, it won only 41 seats compared to the UDF’s 100, but bounced back to 102 in 2006 after a term out of office. Similar patterns recur in 2011, when the LDF’s seat count fell to 70 from 102, illustrating the electorate’s tendency to punish prolonged rule regardless of performance. These cycles show that voter fatigue and anti-incumbency are embedded in Kerala’s political DNA, particularly against fronts seeking consecutive terms.The concern is amplified by the LDF’s recent tenure. Having governed since 2016 and securing 94 seats in 2021, the Left is now eyeing for a third consecutive term, a period historically vulnerable to voter backlash. With past trends showing that even strong governments can be significantly reduced after two terms, anti-incumbency presents a major hurdle for the LDF as it seeks to retain power in 2026.Another major challenge confronting the Left in Kerala is the steady rise of the saffron wave, reflected clearly in the BJP’s expanding influence in the past two decades.The BJP finally opened its account in Kerala in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning its first-ever parliamentary seat in the state.The CPI(M) too was left with just one seat, secured as part of the INDIA bloc, but the result carried little sense of achievement for the Left. For a party that once commanded double-digit representation from Kerala, repeating a single-seat tally for the second consecutive general election highlighted not stability but a prolonged erosion of influence.Alongside the seat win, the NDA raised its vote share to 19.4 per cent from 15.6 per cent in 2019, signalling that the party’s support base had reached a level where it could no longer be dismissed as electorally marginal.The CPM, which had won 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2004, saw its tally fall to four in 2009 and five in 2014, before being reduced to just one seat in 2019—a position it failed to improve upon in the 2024 elections.The contrasting trajectories underline a shift in Kerala’s national-level political landscape, where the Left’s once-dominant presence has steadily weakened even as the BJP has begun converting vote share into representation.Local body polls painted another scary picture for the Left, reinforcing concerns about the growing saffron wave ahead of the 2026 assembly elections.Seen as a semi-final to the state polls, the results delivered a sharp setback to the governing LDF, cutting through its welfare claims and governance pitch and reducing it to its weakest grassroots performance in years.While the Congress-led UDF mounted a sweeping comeback across all tiers of local self-government, the BJP-led NDA expanded beyond its traditional confines, transforming Kerala’s familiar bipolar contest into an increasingly triangular one.The most dramatic rupture came in Thiruvananthapuram, where the BJP-led NDA ended the CPM’s three-decade grip on the city corporation. Emerging as the single-largest front with 50 of 100 wards—just one short of an absolute majority—the NDA pushed the LDF down to 29 seats, while the UDF nearly doubled its tally from 10 wards in 2020 to 19.The result, hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a watershed moment in Kerala politics, underscored how the saffron surge has moved from the periphery to the centre of the state’s political contest, posing a direct challenge to the Left’s long-standing dominance.Demographically, Hindus constitute 54.73% of Kerala’s population. Muslims account for 26.56% and Christians 18.38%, both remaining influential but more regionally concentrated.As the Left confronts shrinking margins and the rise of new competitors, especially in Hindu-majority regions, it has increasingly sought to complement its long-standing minority outreach with calibrated appeals to the majority community.","Kerala's Left has, for decades, projected itself as an ideological outlier in Indian politics. But as the state heads toward another high-stakes electoral cycle, that self-image appears increasingly strained. Anti-incumbency pressures, the steady expansion of the BJP’s footprint, and shifting demographic and electoral calculations have forced recalibration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128202245,imgsize-1315252,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: District-wise data of deletions made in the final electoral roll of Assam published on Tuesday, show a decline in the electorate of 25 of the state's 35 districts as compared to the draft roll.While Cachar district witnessed the maximum decline of electors in absolute terms, with a total 33,536 shaved off the draft list, Karimganj reported the maximum percentage of deletions, with 3.2% less electors as compared to the draft roll.As per data exclusively accessed by the TOI, Udalgiri and Darrang district had 2.7% electors struck off, while the deletions in Lakhimpur, Cachar and Kamrup Metro districts were around 2.4% each.Among the 10 districts where electors rose in number as compared to the draft list, Barpeta had the highest additions both in absolute (28,625) and percentage (3%) terms.Nagaon district now has the highest number of total electors at 15.5 lakh, followed by Cachar at 13.8 lakh. The districts with the smallest electorate are the tribal-dominated Dima Hasao, with less than 1.6 lakh electors ,and West Karbi Anglong with 2.3 lakh electors.Indicating the decisive role of women in choosing the next govt in Assam, female electors outnumber their male counterparts across 86 of the state's total 126 assembly constituencies, even though the overall sex ratio of the state's electorate (female voters per 1000 male voters) is 1000. Doom Dooma assembly constituency (AC) in Tinsukia district leads the way with a sex ratio of 1118, followed by Jalukbari AC in Kamrup Metro district at 1113 and Makum AC in Tinsukia at 1100. However, the sex ratio is most skewed against women in Algapur-Katlicherra AC in Hailakandi district at 910, followed by Chenga AC in Barpeta district at 918.As per the final electoral roll for Assam published on Tuesday after summary revision, the state's total electorate stands at around 2.5 crore after the deletion of 0.97% electors included the draft list. The final electorate, however, is higher than the state's 2.4 crore electorate in 2024 general elections.Unlike the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise undertaken in the other poll-bound states/UT of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry, summary revision does not involve filling up of enumeration forms or establishing a link with the electoral roll from the last SIR. However, the summary revision in Assam did include house-to-house verification of the electors.","District-wise data of deletions made in the final electoral roll of Assam published on Tuesday, show a decline in the electorate of 25 of the state's 35 districts.

NEW DELHI: In a significant ruling, the Delhi high court has granted bail to an accused charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), citing a violation of his fundamental constitutional rights regarding the timing of his production before a magistrate.The appellant, Harsh Pal Singh alias Rubal, was allegedly involved in an organized crime syndicate and faced charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and the Arms Act. Justice Chandrasekharan Sudha delivered the judgment on February 10, 2026, setting aside a previous trial court order that had denied him bail.The core of the legal dispute centered on the timeline of the appellant's arrest and subsequent production in court. Singh was detained at Amritsar Airport on the night of September 25, 2025, while attempting to travel to Bangkok.He was subsequently handed over to the Delhi Police Special Cell and produced before a Special Court on September 27, 2025.The defense team led by, Advocate Rajani and Nishant Rana, argued that the total time he spent in custody before being presented to a magistrate exceeded the 24-hour limit mandated by Article 22 (2) of the Constitution and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.While the prosecution claimed Singh had been briefly interrogated and released on a notice to join the investigation the next day, the high court found these claims ""quite doubtful"". General Diary entries indicated that Singh’s belongings, including his passport and bag, were handed over to the Delhi team, who then left with him in a government vehicle, making a formal release unlikely.The court emphasized that the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours is a peremptory constitutional mandate. Citing Supreme Court precedents, the court noted that any detention beyond this period without judicial authority renders the custody illegal.Despite the prosecution's concerns regarding the gravity of the offences and Singh’s perceived attempt to abscond by booking a flight shortly after receiving a police notice, the court maintained that procedural law must be strictly followed. Consequently, bail was granted on stringent conditions, including a personal bond of Rs two lakhs.","Delhi high court has granted bail to an accused charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) Harsh Pal Singh alias Rubal was allegedly involved in an organized crime syndicate and faced charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and the Arms Act.

A new white paper notes that “Indian migration to the UK has evolved in four distinct waves since 1947, each aligned with Britain’s shifting economic and labour needs.” and argues that it has played a central role in shaping modern Britain’s economyThe report titled “Migration of the Indian Diaspora to the UK”, released by Manish Tiwari of Here & Now 365 in collaboration with the Aston India Centre at Aston University, traces the evolution of Indian migration.According to the study, the first wave arrived during post-war labour shortages, with “post-war migration from India help[ing] address acute labour shortages across manufacturing, transport and public services, contributing to the foundations of the National Health Service.”The second wave followed the 1970s expulsion of Asians from East Africa, which “led to significant entrepreneurial activity and local economic regeneration.”Many of these families established businesses that revitalised local economies.As the UK economy transitioned toward a knowledge-based model, Indian migration increasingly comprised skilled professionals. The white paper estimates that “Indian-born professionals are estimated to account for around 15% of the UK’s technology workforce.”In the post-Brexit and post-pandemic period, the fourth wave is described as strategically significant. “Indian professionals have become strategically important in addressing critical skills shortages,” the report states.Describing the Indian diaspora as “among the most economically successful ethnic minority groups in the UK,” the study underscores the community’s continued role in healthcare, technology and entrepreneurship.","Migration of the Indian Diaspora to the UK has evolved in four distinct waves since 1947.

The Supreme Court has reduced compensation awarded to a woman over a “faulty haircut” at a luxury hotel salon from Rs 2 crore to Rs 25 lakh, ruling that damages must be supported by material evidence.A bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and Manmohan, in a judgment delivered on February 6, said “deficiency in service” had been established, but compensation in consumer disputes cannot be based on the “mere asking” or “whims and fancies” of a complainant.Justice Bindal, who authored the 34-page judgment, said, “The damages cannot be awarded merely on presumptions or whims and fancies of the complainant. To make out a case for award of damages, especially when the claim is to the tune of crores of rupees, some trustworthy and reliable evidence has to be led.”The verdict said the case was not a minor dispute where the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission could award compensation using a thumb rule or rough estimation.""Claim of compensation was for crores of rupees, for which some loss suffered by the respondent because of deficiency in service was required to be established. This could not be established by merely producing photocopies of the documents. Even the discrepancies in the photocopies produced on record by the respondent, as pointed out by the appellant, have been noticed … Thus, even after remand, the respondent has not been able to make out a case for award of such huge compensation,"" the verdict said.The court said the apex consumer panel erred in awarding Rs 2 crore in compensation based on photocopies of documents. It rejected the panel’s view that reliance on photocopies was justified because the complainant may not have retained originals due to trauma, noting this could not justify such a large award.The verdict added that even if only photocopies were available, there were other ways to substantiate the claim.""Even if the Code of Civil Procedure may not be strictly applicable, the Commission has not assessed as to how the respondent suffered loss to the tune of Rs 2,00,00,000/-. General discussion in the impugned judgment may not justify the same,"" the verdict said.Aashna Roy visited the hotel salon in 2018 and asked the staff to trim about four inches (10 cm) from the ends of her hair. However, the hairdresser cut off most of her hair, leaving only about four inches from the top, with her hair barely touching her shoulders.The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had awarded compensation on the grounds that Roy was an established model and that the haircut affected her career. The court had said at the time that the incident led to a “severe mental breakdown and trauma.”",Aashna Roy visited the hotel salon in 2018 and asked the staff to trim about four inches (10 cm) from the ends of her hair.

India switches to annual drug drive to end Elephantiasis by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-switches-to-annual-drug-drive-to-end-elephantiasis-by-2027/articleshow/128188901.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a major push to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, the Centre on Monday rolled out a nationwide annual mass drug administration campaign across 12 endemic states, signalling a decisive shift in strategy to meet its 2027 elimination target.Launching the campaign, Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda said the move from biannual to a single, focused drug round each year aims to improve compliance, strengthen surveillance and overcome last-mile gaps that have slowed progress in several districts.Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a mosquito-borne disease that damages the lymphatic system and can cause irreversible swelling of limbs, hydrocele, disability and social stigma. The disease remains endemic in 348 districts across 20 states and Union Territories.While 143 districts have successfully stopped mass drug administration after clearing transmission assessment surveys, nearly half continue to report infection levels above the elimination threshold. Health ministry data show over 6.2 lakh people living with lymphoedema and more than 1.2 lakh hydrocele cases in endemic areas.The current round of annual drug administration is being implemented in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, covering 719 blocks in 124 districts. The objective is to bring microfilaria prevalence below one percent, the benchmark required to interrupt transmission.India has committed to eliminating filariasis as a public health problem by the end of 2027, three years ahead of the global target. Officials said the redesigned annual campaign will allow uninterrupted monitoring, particularly during the monsoon months when drug delivery and follow-up have traditionally suffered.Addressing state health ministers and senior officials, Nadda said filariasis is not just a medical condition but a disease that erodes livelihoods and traps families in long-term economic distress. He stressed the need for direct observation of drug consumption, stronger vector control and sustained community engagement to counter public hesitancy.The programme also places renewed focus on morbidity management, including hydrocele surgeries and care for patients with chronic swelling. Such surgeries are covered under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme, while Ayushman Arogya Mandirs are expected to support early detection and follow-up care.Officials said steady gains over the past decade, including improved drug compliance and wider district-level coverage, have laid the groundwork for the final push towards a filariasis-free India.","India has committed to eliminating filariasis as a public health problem by the end of 2027.

New Delhi: As the opposition gathered to decide strategy for the upcoming discussion on Budget on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi faced a unanimous demand from allies that he should start the debate, if only to get back at BJP which had not let him speak for seven days. The demand was led by DMK’s T R Baalu and supported by others. But Rahul resisted.He argued that if he stood up to speak, it would result in objections from the treasury benches. And the ensuing commotion would cost every opposition party the chance to speak. He underlined that all regional parties has important issues to raise, and they should not fall prey to “organised disruptions” of BJP.The move won a few hearts in the room, with an ally-critic of LoP Rahul Gandhi later describing it as a “magnanimous” gesture.The meeting was attended by Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge, K C Venugopal, Naseer Hussain and Manickam Tagore, Ramgopal Yadav (SP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Sanjay Raut and Arvind Sawant (SS), John Brittas (CPM), PC Gupta (RJD), Shatabdi Roy (TMC), E T Mohd Basheer (IUML), Rajaram Singh (CPI-ML), among others.That was how the plan was clinched, with the party sticking to Shashi Tharoor to initiate the discussion.Gandhi will speak on the Budget on Wednesday.When the India bloc leaders met in Kharge’s chamber to brainstorm on the future course, the allies decided on ending the logjam.If Gandhi is still blocked from speaking, they would submit the planned no-confidence notice against Speaker Om Birla, and then get on with the stalled business. If Gandhi is allowed, the notice will not be filed.Lok Sabha is now expected to hold normal proceedings.","Gandhi faced a unanimous demand from allies that he should start the debate.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

A unified visa promotes the GCC as a single tourism destination, enhancing its competitiveness with regions like Europe and ASEAN. Simplified logistics: Digital applications and harmonized border systems reduce wait times and bureaucratic friction.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf.

Alex Tuch of Buffalo Sabres and Vincent Trocheck of New York Rangers future amid NHL trade rumors

As time runs out, NHL news suggests that several teams are focusing not on a bold overhaul of their roster, but on stability. The Buffalo Sabres are now in a dilemma about the situation of the contract of Alex Tuch since they are already in the competition. Instead of relocating some of its star players, the management does not seem to be willing to dilute the line unless there is a phenomenal bid.Meanwhile, at the New York Rangers, Vincent Trocheck is gaining growing interest as a consistent producer and versatile forward, becoming one of the hottest prospective trades in the NHL. His ability to work in various capacities, together with his good performances in high-pressure matches, has made him valuable in the eyes of the teams considering the need to upgrade their roster before major NHL games.Recent reports indicate that the Buffalo Sabres can use Alex Tuch as an in-house rental unless a new contract is signed in the near future. Retaining him would mean that they will have confidence in their present line-up and their success in the playoffs, which correlates with reports that the company does not wish to make a backstep in the season.In the meantime, Vincent Trocheck of the New York Rangers has become one of the most discussed centers to be found in the market. His two-way game, physical advantage and consistent scoring rate make him attractive to those looking to add depth in the middle but not the top. With the NHL news roundup coverage ongoing discussion, the two players are still some of the figures that are defining the new trade scenario, as well as how the teams are verifying the deadline.","NHL news suggests that several teams are focusing not on a bold overhaul of their roster, but on stability.

NEW DELHI: Magenta Line, which is set to become the longest metro corridor, will feature the highest number of interchange stations at 21, significantly enhancing cross-city connectivity across National Capital Region, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation stated on Wednesday.The line will run from Botanical Garden to Inderlok via Central Vista and function entirely as a driverless corridor once fully operational.TOI reported on Jan 31 that after the approval of Phase-V (A)'s corridor from Ramakrishna Ashram Marg to Indraprastha via Central Vista, the Indraprastha-Inderlok corridor of Phase-IV would be implemented as an extension of Magenta Line, instead of earlier plans for Green Line. This will take the total length of Magenta Line to around 89km, surpassing Pink Line.The Krishna Park Extension-RK Ashram Marg stretch of Magenta Line is expected to open in the next financial year in phases while the RK Ashram-Indraprastha section is likely to open by 2028. The remaining corridor from Indraprastha to Inderlok will open in phases.Its operational stretch has four interchange stations — Kalkaji Mandir, Botanical Garden, Janakpuri West and Hauz Khas.An additional 17 interchange stations will be added due to the expansions: Kalindi Kunj, Chirag Dilli, Terminal-1 IGI Airport, Peeragarhi, Pitampura (Madhuban Chowk), Haiderpur Badli Mor, Majlis Park, Azadpur, Pulbangash, Nabi Karim, Ramakrishna Ashram Marg, Shivaji Stadium, Central Secretariat, Indraprastha, Delhi Gate, New Delhi and Inderlok. Of these, Central Secretariat, Azadpur, New Delhi and Inderlok will become triple interchange stations.Currently, the Pink and Blue lines have the highest number of interchange stations at 12 each. After the addition of new corridors, they will have 15 and 14 interchange stations, respectively.Pink Line, from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar, is now the longest corridor of the metro network, spanning 59.2km. Once its Phase-IV extension from Majlis Park to Maujpur becomes operational, the corridor's length will rise to nearly 72km. Despite this expansion, Magenta Line will emerge as the longest line, with 65 stations.The line will also have the highest number of underground stations. ""The line from Botanical Garden to Inderlok will have 65 stations, out of which 40 will be underground. The extensive interchange facilities of Magenta Line are expected to reduce travel time, decongest major corridors and provide seamless, end-to-end connectivity across the city,"" said Anuj Dayal, principal executive director of corporate communications at DMRC.Magenta Line also hosts two significant engineering landmarks of the Delhi Metro network, Dayal added. Haiderpur Badli Mor is the highest elevated metro station at the rail level height of approximately 28.4 metres at pier number 340, while Hauz Khas is the deepest underground station at around 29 metres.","Magenta Line will feature the highest number of interchange stations at 21.

KOLKATA: A study of EC’s special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls has found that Muslim voters form a disproportionately large share of those flagged under the “logical discrepancy” category in two politically significant assembly constituencies in south Kolkata, triggering fresh questions over the system-driven scrutiny process.According to research by Sabar Institute, Muslims account for about 52% of voters marked with “logical discrepancies” in Bhowanipore, a central-south Kolkata constituency around the city’s traditional commercial and political hub, and nearly 78% in Ballygunge, an adjoining upscale residential area in south Kolkata.In Bhowanipore, 7,846 of the 15,145 voters whose enumeration forms were flagged for “logical discrepancies” are Muslims, the study shows. In Ballygunge, 23,256 of the 30,008 voters in the same category belong to the minority community.The skew stands out when compared with other categories of deletions or corrections. “In Bhowanipore, Muslims form only 22.7% of voters marked as ‘absent, shifted or dead/duplicate’ (ASD) and about 26% of unmapped voters,” said Ashin Chakraborty, who conducted the study with Souptik Halder and Sabir Ahamed. “Those figures broadly match the Muslim population share of around 20% in the constituency, as per the 2011 Census.But under ‘logical discrepancy’, the proportion jumps sharply to 52%.”A similar pattern emerges in Ballygunge, where Muslims account for about 44% of ASD voters and 42% of unmapped voters, close to their estimated 50% population share in the constituency. EC officials rejected allegations of bias. An EC official said the electoral roll does not record religion and the commission maintains no religion-wise voter data.Political reactions were sharp. Political analyst Udayan Bandyopadhyay alleged the artificial intelligence programme used for SIR had been “intentionally designed” to harass minority voters, particularly women. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh accused BJP of using voter list revisions to target Muslim-majority areas.The findings add a new layer of controversy to the SIR exercise in Kolkata, with demands growing for an audit of the software-driven “logical discrepancy” filter to ensure the revision process does not disproportionately affect any community.",Muslim voters form a disproportionately large share of those flagged under the “logical discrepancy” category in two assembly constituencies in south Kolkata.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday dismissed a plea seeking furlough by Vikas Yadav , serving a 25-year jail term without remission for the murder of Nitish Katara in 2002.He had sought 21 days' furlough to maintain social ties and spend time with his wife following his recent marriage. Justice Ravinder Dud-eja said there was no arbitrariness, illegality or violation of constitutional rights in the order passed by the jail authorities rejecting Yadav's request for release.Yadav, convicted in the 2002 murder case, is serving a fixed 25-year sentence and has undergone over 23 years of actual incarceration.In his plea, the convict challenged the Oct 29, 2025, decision of the jail authorit-ies denying him furlough on the ground that the rejection was arbitrary and failed to take into account that he earl-ier received interim bail by Supreme Court for over four and a half months on account of his mother's medical treatment, which the apex court later extended on the ground of his marriage.The plea stated that Yad-av had remained in continuous custody for 23 years without being granted furlough and now sought temporary release to maintain social ties, particularly with his wife. However, the pris-on authorities and the mot-her of the victim, Neelam Katara, opposed the plea, citing the gravity of the offence, the severity of the sentence imposed and the absence of requisite annual conduct reports.The jail authorities al-so stated that there were concerns that the convict mig-ht flee the country, disturb public order or cause harm to the victim's family.The high court upheld the decision of the prison authorities, observing that no grounds were made out to interfere with the impugned orders.Vikas and his cousin, Vishal Yadav, among others, were sentenced to 25 years of actual imprisonment without consideration of remission for the murder.","Vikas Yadav is serving a 25-year jail term without remission for the murder of Nitish Katara in 2002.

From grainy pics to forensics: Inside Delhi police unit that finds missing people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/from-grainy-pics-to-forensics-inside-police-unit-that-finds-missing-people/articleshow/128170499.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Head constables Amit and Upender sit before a flickering computer monitor at the nodal headquarters of the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) in Rohini, their eyes scanning a grainy photograph of a teenager who vanished from a bus terminal in Delhi three years ago. For them, this isn't just another file in a mountain of paperwork; it is a puzzle that spans the breadth of the country.Over their two-year-long tenure at the unit, they have developed a sixth sense for the digital breadcrumbs left behind by the missing. They move seamlessly between the ZIPNet portal and the Vatsalya database, cross-referencing blurred CCTV stills with records from child care institutions (CCIs) in West Bengal and Odisha.Both are part of the AHTU under Delhi Police crime branch, a force that has turned the desperate search for the lost into a data-driven science of reunion. The genesis of this specialised unit dates back to 2014, following a directive from the Union home ministry to create a bulwark against human exploitation. What began as a focused response to human trafficking has evolved into a sophisticated 18-unit network that blankets the NCT of Delhi.From the bustling corridors of Indira Gandhi International airport to the sprawling railway terminuses, the AHTU operates with a mandate that covers the darkest corners of urban life: kidnapping, abduction, child labour, sexual abuse, and the rescue of those forced into begging. Stationed at Sector 16, Rohini, the AHTU acts as the central nervous system for these operations, coordinating with district units and non-governmental organisations to ensure no child falls through the cracks of a fragmented bureaucracy.For police commissioner Satish Golcha and special CP (crime) Devesh Srivastava Police, the AHTU is a high-priority unit that functions with a lean but elite force of inspectors, sub-inspectors and subordinate staff who treat every missing person report not as a statistic, but as a ticking clock.The AHTU's methodology is a blend of rigorous legal enforcement and empathetic social intervention. When a minor goes missing in Delhi, the machinery of the AHTU begins to grind within minutes. The law dictates the immediate registration of an FIR, but the unit's internal protocols go further.Within 24 hours, the details of the missing child are broadcast across ZIPNet and the Vatsalya portal, making the information instantly accessible to every police station in the city. This digital net is cast wide, involving the State Crime Records Bureau, the National Crime Records Bureau and the CBI, when necessary.The most effective work often happens on the ground though. Officers like assistant sub-inspector Gopal Krishan, who has spent seven years in the unit, know that the digital trail is only half the battle. Krishan has personally traced more than 750 missing or kidnapped persons, often travelling to remote villages in Bihar or Rajasthan to follow a lead. His work has earned him six Asadharan Karya Puraskar (AKP) awards. His colleagues like head constables Sukanya and Seema Tyagi are also celebrated cops in this domain.The legal framework under which these officers operate has recently transitioned to the provisions of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, specifically sections addressing kidnapping and trafficking, alongside Juvenile Justice Act and Pocso Act. This legal arsenal allows the AHTU to not only find the missing, but also to dismantle the syndicates that profit from their absence.The unit's investigations are often monitored by high-level bodies like National Human Rights Commission and Delhi Commission for Women, ensuring that a victim-centric approach remains the priority.""This is particularly crucial in habeas corpus petitions assigned by Delhi High Court, where the AHTU is tasked by the judiciary to produce a missing individual who may have been held against their will for years,"" explained an officer. The success rate in such cases is a point of pride for the unit and reflects inter-agency coordination.One of the most effective strategies in the AHTU's toolkit is the implementation of focused campaigns like Operation Muskan and Operation Milap. These month-long drives are designed to saturate the search effort, focusing specifically on children lodged in CCIs who may have been unable to communicate their origins. During these operations, officers become detectives of identity, using old photographs, half-remembered names of villages, or even distinct scars to link ""unclaimed"" children with ""missing"" reports.The vulnerability of children aged under 14 is given special emphasis, as they are the most at risk of being absorbed into labour or trafficking rings. The effectiveness of these drives was vividly demonstrated in Dec 2025, when a special drive ordered by special CP (crime) Devesh Srivastava led to the tracing of a staggering 795 missing persons and children in a single month.""The AHTU's work also extends to prevention, with awareness campaigns in slums and schools, sensitising RWAs to the safety measures that can prevent a child from being snatched in the first place. Between 2020 and July 2025, the unit successfully traced over 1,100 minor children,"" said a DCP-rank officer.A significant portion of these were adolescent girls, a demographic that faces a unique set of perils. The tracing of these persons often requires the AHTU to navigate complex social realities, including the monitoring of placement agencies that provide domestic helps, which can sometimes serve as fronts for exploitation.To maintain the highest standards of operation, in early 2025, the AHTU sought and achieved IS/ISO 9001:2015 certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards. ""This certification is more than a badge of honour; it is a validation of the unit's transparency and quality-driven framework, making it a rare example of a police unit that operates with the administrative precision of a high-end corporation,"" said special CP Srivastava.Ultimately, the story of the AHTU is not found in the ISO certificates or the technical portals, but in the moments of reunion that happen in the quiet corners of the Rohini office. It is found in the look on a mother's face when she sees a child she thought was lost forever, and in the satisfaction of an officer like Sukanya or Gopal Krishan as they close a file that has been open for years, ensuring that in the vast, chaotic landscape of the national capital, no one stays missing forever.","The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) is a specialised unit under Delhi Police crime branch. It was set up in 2014 following a directive from the Union home ministry to create a bulwark against human exploitation.

NEW DELHI: A critical jaw reconstruction surgery at AIIMS, Delhi has been stalled for over two months due to an administrative deadlock under Ayushman Bharat scheme, leaving a Haryana govt beneficiary in severe pain and unable to eat solid food.Dolly Mandal, a resident of Faridabad, suffered from ameloblastoma of the right mandible, a rare but locally aggressive jaw tumour that destroys bone and can lead to infection and facial deformity if not treated in time.Doctors at AIIMS advised an extended total temporomandibular joint replacement (one unit, right side) to remove the diseased portion of her jaw and reconstruct it. The procedure, estimated to cost Rs 2.5 lakh, including implants, was flagged as medically urgent, with doctors warning that delay could lead to rapid deterioration.""The patient is undergoing treatment in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Pre-authorisation was initiated on Dec 6, 2025, and the case taken up with the state health agency, Haryana, through email and telephonic follow-up. Approval, however, is pending with the state and is subject to clearance by the standing medical committee,"" said Dr V K Bansal, department of surgery, AIIMS.The authority to approve the procedure rests with state govt and is outside the ambit of AIIMS and National Health Authority, Bansal said.Alternative financial assistance may be explored only if the patient holds a BPL ration card, including relief under Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi/Health Minister's Discretionary Grant or the chief minister's fund, he added.During the prolonged wait, Mandal's condition has worsened. Pus began discharging from the tumour, forcing her to survive on a liquid-only diet. The delay has also crippled the family financially, with the patient unable to work and her husband, a daily-wage labourer, staying back in Delhi to care for her and pursue the approvals.The pre-authorisation procedure was filed under an unspecified surgical package, as extended temporomandibular joint replacement is not listed under Health Benefit Package 2022, requiring special clearance from the state health authority. However, the process stalled amid administrative gaps at the state level.The case has drawn sharp legal criticism. ""Why should a patient suffer because of paperwork? Administrative procedures cannot be a reason for delaying treatment.
