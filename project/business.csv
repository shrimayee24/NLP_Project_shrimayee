NEW DELHI: February is likely to be warmer than usual with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicting ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month and ‘below normal’ cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India. The Met department also issued advisories, noting how dry and higher-than-normal temperatures during the month may adversely impact farm and allied sectors in terms of yield reduction.The IMD, while releasing a monthly weather outlook for February, also predicted ‘below normal’ rainfall over most parts of the country, except some areas of northwest and east-central India.The less rainfall situation during the month may impact the standing Rabi (winter sown) crops in terms of increasing irrigation cost, whereas the ‘above normal’ temperatures in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan could lead to “forced maturity” of crops like wheat and barley, leading to sterile spikelets and chaffy grains, resulting in yield reduction.“The crop advisories and impacts have been prepared by us in association with the department of agriculture, for which farmers need to be prepared,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra while sharing the likely impact of ‘above normal’ temperatures on agriculture.He said, “Oilseeds and pulses such as mustard, chickpea, lentil, and field pea may show early flowering and premature maturity, resulting in poor pod development, reduced seed size and lower yields.”Warmer conditions may also favour rapid multiplication of aphids and othersucking pests, impacting standing crops. Vegetable crops such as potato, onion, garlic, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage, and peas may also be adversely affected during critical stages like tuber initiation, bulb development, flowering, and fruit setting.IMD shared that the elevated temperatures can induce bolting in onion and garlic, reduce tuber bulking in potato, cause flower drop in tomato, and deteriorate cole crops, thereby lowering yield and market value.“Horticultural crops such as mango, citrus, banana, and grapes may experience earlyflowering, uneven fruit set and increased fruit drop. ‘Above normal’ temperatures may also reduce chilling accumulation in temperate fruits like apple, pear and peach, leading to irregular flowering and poor fruit development,” said the Met department in its Agromet advisory.It also underlined the impact on livestock and poultry, saying they may experience heat stress, resulting in reduced feed intake, decline in milk yield and egg production, and increased susceptibility to diseases if adequate cooling and hydration measures are not adopted.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicted ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month. ‘below normal” cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India.

"After Supreme Court rap and ministry reminders, 65 medical colleges still off NMC records on intern stipends: RTI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-supreme-court-rap-and-ministry-reminders-65-medical-colleges-still-off-nmc-records-on-intern-stipends-rti/articleshow/127831428.cms,"Representative AI image

NEW DELHI: Even after sharp observations from the Supreme Court and repeated reminders from the Union health ministry, the National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns, with 65 medical colleges still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.On October 28, 2025, the Supreme Court of India took note of a public notice issued earlier by the NMC on July 11, directing medical colleges to upload details of stipend payments to interns within seven days. The court observed that although the regulator had sought the information, it appeared to be “dragging its feet”, as no action seemed to have been taken against non-compliant institutions. The bench expressed hope that the NMC would act on its own warning at least by the next date of hearing.Following the court’s observations, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare wrote to the NMC on November 3, asking it to examine the matter and take appropriate action. With no response forthcoming, the ministry sent a reminder on December 16.Earlier, in its July 11 public notice, the NMC had warned that failure to comply with directions on stipend disclosure would attract regulatory action, including show-cause notices, financial penalties, withdrawal of course recognition and suspension of admissions.Responding to queries, NMC officials said that out of 764 medical colleges in the country, 595 are eligible to train interns and are required to pay stipends. Around 560 colleges have submitted stipend details, while about 35 remain in default. Officials said the commission has issued multiple reminders, filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on November 11, 2025, and issued a show-cause notice on November 3, 2025, warning of action under the NMC Act. They added that responses from defaulting colleges are being examined and a final list will be placed before the Undergraduate Medical Education Board for action as per rules.However, the RTI reply dated January 19 stated that about 65 medical colleges were yet to furnish stipend details. The reply did not clarify whether this higher number reflected an earlier stage of data compilation or included institutions not eligible to train interns.RTI activist Dr Babu KV, however, said the RTI response does not indicate that any regulatory action has been initiated so far against defaulting colleges, despite the Supreme Court’s observations and repeated communications from the health ministry.","The National Medical Commission has failed to enforce its own directions on payment of stipends to medical interns. 65 medical colleges are still yet to submit required details, according to an RTI reply.

India Can Be Pivotal In Peace And Two-State Solution, Says Palestine Ambassador

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian, and reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.The minister met the PM as a member of a delegation of the foreign ministers of Arab countries who are in India for the second India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. The meeting saw external affairs minister S Jaishankar asserting that the countries targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves.According to an Indian readout, Modi conveyed his appreciation for the important role played by the Arab League in supporting efforts towards regional peace and stability.“The Arab world is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood, linked by deep civilisational bonds, vibrant people-to-people connections and enduring brotherly ties, as well as a shared commitment to peace, progress and stability. Confident that enhanced cooperation in technology, energy, trade and innovation will unlock new opportunities and take the partnership to new heights,” said Modi in a post on X.Highlighting the “humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”, the Palestinian minister told Modi Palestine values India’s principled support for Palestinian rights under international law.According to external affairs ministry, the PM outlined his vision for the India-Arab partnership in the years ahead and reaffirmed India’s commitment to further deepen cooperation in trade and investment, energy, technology, healthcare and other priority areas, for the mutual benefit of our peoples.“India has been a long-standing development partner for Palestine. This has been rendered both bilaterally and through UN agencies. India has so far given assistance worth USD 170 million. Of these, projects worth USD 40 million are under implementation,” said a source.In the foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar strongly raised the issue of cross-border terrorism saying it’s particularly unacceptable because it violates the basic principles of international relations and diplomacy. He also told the Arab foreign ministers societies targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves and will understandably exercise it. “It is essential that we strengthen international cooperation to combat what is a global scourge. Zero-tolerance for terrorism must be an uncompromising universal norm,” he said.He also said the changing landscape in West Asia has implications for India’s relations with the Arab world as well and taking forward the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict was a widely shared priority.“Various countries have made policy declarations on the peace plan, individually or collectively. This is the larger context in which we deliberate on the region’s challenges and prospects,” said the minister.","PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian.

New Delhi: Days after India and European Union clinched what has been termed as ‘mother of all trade deals’, CJI Surya Kant on Saturday wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system in the country. Referring to the uncertain business atmosphere in the world, apparently because of arbitrary import tariffs imposed by the US on various countries, CJI Kant said, “Today, we face a world transformed by uncertainty.”“The forces of disruption and geopolitical tension threaten to destabilise the very framework of international cooperation. In such a world, France-India partnership is not a luxury, it is a lifeline.”Addressing the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Paris Bar Association, the CJI said that for foreign enterprises engaging with their Indian counterparts, India’s legal ecosystem offers clarity. “All that one would have to do is draft well-defined arbitration clauses, select reputable institutions or neutral seats if appropriate and trust that India’s courts will respect the sanctity of arbitral agreements and awards,” he said.CJI Kant said SC provides a safety net against any biased arbitral awards that may adversely impact foreign companies operating in India. “SC has made it clear that while arbitral autonomy must be respected, the judiciary cannot relinquish its supervisory role when natural justice is at stake.” “In this context, SC has adopted a calibrated approach of minimal judicial intervention in its role as guardian of credibility, where, for instance, domestic awards may be set aside if bias, corruption or serious procedural deficiencies are proven,” he said.Indian laws encourage pre-litigation mediation. “This approach reflects global best practice: to resolve differences before they ripen into full-fledged litigation, preserving business relationships and reducing strain on judicial systems,” he said.",CJI Surya Kant wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system.

Budget 2026 expectations: Will gold and silver import duties be hiked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-will-gold-and-silver-import-duties-be-hiked/articleshow/127822182.cms,"Why gold and silver imports worry policymakers



Why markets expect a duty hike



Why demand has held up despite record prices



Will higher duties curb demand?



Why silver is also under scrutiny



India’s gold and silver imports surged to record levels in 2025, ringing alarm bells in government and policy circles as soaring precious metal prices threaten to widen the trade deficit and add fresh pressure on the rupee. With limited policy tools available, officials and market participants told Reuters raising import duties is once again emerging as a key option under consideration.Any move to raise import duties may be signalled through the Union Budget 2026, either via changes in the customs duty structure or through an enabling provision allowing the government flexibility to act if external pressures intensify.Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025, while silver imports jumped sharply by 44% to $9.2 billion, even as global prices of both metals hit historic highs. Together, gold and silver accounted for nearly a tenth of India’s total foreign exchange reserves last year, a share that could rise further in 2026 if prices continue to climb.India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold and the largest market for silver, but it depends almost entirely on imports to meet domestic demand for gold and more than 80% of its silver requirements. The surge in imports has widened the trade deficit and contributed to weakness in the rupee, which touched a record low earlier this month.While silver has extensive industrial uses—from solar power to electronics—gold is largely consumed for jewellery and investment. Policymakers have long viewed gold demand as non-essential and a drain on foreign exchange, prompting repeated attempts to curb imports through higher duties.With gold and silver prices at record highs, even stable import volumes translate into a sharply higher import bill. Trade and industry officials say this could prompt the government to consider raising duties in the coming weeks to contain external imbalances.India has a precedent. In 2012–13, New Delhi sharply increased gold import duties to stabilise the rupee during a period of currency stress. Traders now speculate a similar move could be on the cards, potentially reversing the 2024 duty cuts, when import taxes on both metals were slashed to 6% from 15% to curb smuggling.Reflecting these expectations, gold and silver in India are already trading at a premium to global benchmarks as markets price in the risk of higher duties.Gold prices in international markets have surged 98% since the start of 2025, dampening jewellery demand. Yet overall consumption has remained resilient due to a sharp rise in investment demand.While jewellery accounted for over three-fourths of India’s gold demand until 2023, investment now makes up more than 40% of total consumption. Investors have increasingly turned to gold coins, bars and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to benefit from the rally.ETF inflows jumped 283% in 2025 to a record Rs 429.6 billion ($4.69 billion), cushioning the impact of weaker jewellery buying and keeping imports elevated.Past experience suggests duty hikes may have limited impact. When India raised gold import tax to 10% in 2013 from 2%, demand remained largely unchanged. Domestic gold prices have climbed from about Rs 8,000 per 10 grams in 2006 to around Rs 1.62 lakh now, yet annual demand has not seen a sustained decline.Analysts say a fresh duty hike of 4–6 percentage points is unlikely to deter buyers, who absorbed a 76.5% price jump in 2025. Instead, higher duties could lift investor returns and risk reviving smuggling.Silver prices have risen even faster than gold, sharply inflating India’s import bill. While industrial demand was the main driver earlier, investment demand has gained traction in recent months.Silver ETF inflows surged to Rs 234.7 billion in 2025, up from Rs 85.69 billion a year earlier. The growing popularity of silver as an investment suggests imports could rise further if the price rally persists.--- just after peg-- Need 1-2 lines on how this change may be announced in the Budget","Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025.

What do salaried taxpayers, middle class, and the common man want from

Union Budget 2026

on the income tax front? We take a look at the top 5 expectations.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Income Tax Slabs FY 2026-27 & Rebate Under Section 87A

Income up to Rs 4 lakh is exempt from tax - so the basic exemption limit is Rs 4 lakh. There is an ask among taxpayers that this limit be hiked further to reduce compliance burden.

Income in the Rs 4 lakh to Rs 8 lakh bracket attracts a 5% tax.

Income in the Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh bracket attracts a 10% tax.

Income ranging from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh is taxed at 15%, rising to 20% for income between Rs 16 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. Those earning between Rs 20 lakh and rs 24 lakh are taxed at 25%.

Any income above Rs 24 lakh is taxed at the highest slab rate of 30%. Salaried taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to raise the income threshold for 30% tax bracket to Rs 30 lakh.

At present income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers) is tax free after availing rebate under Section 87A. Tax experts suggest that this limit can be hiked to Rs 15 lakh.

Standard Deduction

Home Loan Interest

self-occupied residential property

Section 80C

Tax Filing Compliance

Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief. Last year, FM Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime, and while tax experts believe that there is little fiscal room in Budget 2026 for any big tax income tweaks, there is also a hope that some changes may be brought about to further boost consumption.At present the income tax slabs under the new tax regime are:Several taxpayers continue to file tax returns under the old income tax regime. They want the government to reduce tax rates and hike basic exemption limit under that regime as well.Standard deduction limits under the old and the new income tax regimes differ. Those filing tax under the old income tax regime get the benefit of Rs 50,000 standard deduction, while those under the new income tax regime can avail a higher standard deduction of Rs 75,000. Tax experts are of the view that there is a case to hike the standard deduction limit, especially under the new tax regime which offers very few deductions and exemptions.Individual taxpayers can avail tax deduction on the interest paid on a home loan under the old income tax regime. The interest you pay on a home loan for yourcan be deducted from your taxable income up to ₹2 lakh per year (or actual interest paid if less). Tax experts are of the view that to encourage housing sector, this benefit should also be available under the new tax regime.Section 80C is a popular exemption available under the old income tax regime, but its limit of Rs 1.5 lakh has remained unchanged for many years now. The exemption is for investments made in Provident Fund, Public Provident Fund (PPF), mutual funds and other popular investment options. Tax experts believe that to incentivise savings, there is a case to not only hike this limit, but also include this exemption benefit under the new income tax regime to encourage adoption.The government has been focusing on ease of income tax return filing, but taxpayers believe that e-filing of returns still needs to be made easier. The tax compliance mechanism, grievance redressal system, and tax queries related to mismatches in the Annual Information Statement (AIS), Form 16, Form 26AS needs to be made less complicated, say tax experts.","Budget 2026 income tax expectations: Like every year, salaried taxpayers, middle class and common man will listen to FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget speech in the hope of more tax relief.

NEW DELHI: Stock markets indices were trading trading in green in the Sunday’s special trading session ahead of the Union Budget 2026.The Nifty 50 was at 25,357.15, up by over 36 points, while Sensex was up by over 226.67 points at 82,496.45 , as at 11.05 am.The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had issued separate circulars confirming that trading will proceed as usual on Budget day. Both exchanges said market hours will remain unchanged, following the standard schedule for a regular trading session.Gold and silver prices tumbled on Sunday, hitting lower circuit levels in futures trade ahead of the Union Budget 2026–27 presentation.Gold futures for April 2, 2026, delivery dropped Rs 9,140, or 6%, to Rs 1,43,205 per 10 grams, while silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery fell Rs 17,515, or 6%, to Rs 2,74,410 per kg.The steep fall extended to MCX shares, which slipped 10% to hit the lower circuit at Rs 2,145.25. Analysts attributed the selloff to profit-booking following Friday’s historic crash, which saw both metals post their sharpest single-day declines.Market participants are closely watching how the Union Budget and global cues influence the recovery of precious metals in the coming sessions.Also read: Gold, silver prices crash on Budget 2026 day; hit lower circuit levels in futures trade - what’s causing the slide? The BSE added that while key segments such as equity, futures and options, and commodity derivatives will operate normally, certain specialised sessions will be suspended. “Trading Members may note that trading in the T+0 Settlement Session and Auction Session for settlement default will not be conducted on Sunday, February 01, 2026,” the exchange said.Trading on a Sunday is uncommon for Dalal Street, as both exchanges typically remain shut on weekends and designated public holidays. February 1 will therefore be among the rare Sundays when markets are open for regular trading.Talking about investor expectations, Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited said, “Investors don’t have expectations of any major tax reliefs in this Budget since the 2025 Budget delivered huge income tax reliefs. Some tweaking of certain taxes is likely. If there is an increase in exemption for long-term capital gains tax from Rs 1.25 lakhs presently to a higher limit that would be a positive. From the market perspective, a fiscally prudent, growth-oriented Budget is desirable. There are rumours of exemption from long-term capital gains tax for certain categories of FIIs. If this happens, it can trigger a rally in the market.”Further mentioning sectors that’ll be in focus, he added, “Higher allocation for defense is a given and, therefore, defense stocks will continue to be in focus. A thrust area of the Budget can be exports, particularly manufacturing exports which the Economic Survey harps on. Therefore, export segments are likely to be on the radar of investors. Announcements relating to PSU bank mergers; disinvestment in PSUs will be keenly watched. Aside from the Budget, the crash in precious metal prices may bring investors back into equity.""A look at market trends over the past decade shows that Budgets have sparked strong rallies, but many have led to muted moves or even declines.Markets generally respond well when the Budget emphasises growth, infrastructure spending and tax stability. In 2017, for instance, then finance minister Arun Jaitley avoided major tax hikes and offered relief to the middle class. Investors welcomed the approach, with the Sensex rising about 1.7 per cent and the Nifty gaining nearly 1.8 per cent , one of the stronger Budget Day performances of that period.Another standout came in 2021, when Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Budget in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. With a clear push towards economic recovery, higher capital expenditure, healthcare and infrastructure, markets rallied sharply. The Sensex jumped over 2 per cent and the Nifty climbed almost 2.7 per cent, marking one of the best Budget Day gains in recent years.But not every Budget has cheered investors. In 2016, higher dividend taxation dampened sentiment, and the Sensex ended the day in the red. In 2018, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax on listed equities and equity mutual funds caught markets off guard. Although indices slipped only modestly on the day, they fell around 6.8 per cent over the following sessions. The 2023 Budget triggered a largely flat reaction, as it maintained fiscal discipline but lacked big-bang reforms to excite traders.The July 2024 Budget also drew a cautious response. Changes related to capital gains taxation surprised some investors. While the reaction was not severe, both the Sensex and Nifty ended slightly lower, underscoring how unexpected tax measures can weigh on sentiment even when the broader macro picture is stable.Also historically, volatility after the Budget has been common, and one-month returns have often been mixed.As the nation heads into the Union Budget 2026, market conditions are already unsettled. Equity indices have pulled back from recent highs, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers, and global factors such as interest rates, geopolitical tensions and trade policies continue to influence sentiment. In this backdrop, sharp moves on Budget Day are almost inevitable.","Gold and silver prices tumbled on Sunday, hitting lower circuit levels in futures trade.

Parliament Budget Session

: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2026 in Parliament on February 1, 2026.The Union Budget 2026 will mark FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Budget presentation, making her the first finance minister in India to achieve this milestone. She will also become the first finance minister to present a Union Budget on a Sunday, adding to the historic significance of the occasion.In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha presented the Union Budget a day earlier, on Saturday, February 27. Nirmala Sitharaman has previously presented Budgets on Saturdays as well — on February 1, 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 lockdown, and again on February 1, 2025.Until 1999, the Union Budget was presented at 5 pm, a colonial-era practice aligned with British working hours.

Can parents inherit dead son's frozen semen? Govt challenges Delhi HC order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-parents-inherit-dead-sons-frozen-semen-govt-challenges-delhi-hc-order/articleshow/127827961.cms,".

New Delhi: The Union health ministry has challenged in Delhi high court its ruling asking Sir Gangaram Hospital to release the frozen semen of an unmarried dead man to his parents.The ministry's appeal asked two main questions: Can judges create new heirs, other than a spouse, for children conceived after death, and can gametes/sperm be treated like inheritable property that can be passed on to legal heirs, other than a spouse, without a written consent.In Oct 2024, a single judge held that there is no prohibition on posthumous reproduction if the consent of a sperm or egg owner can be demonstrated and directed the hospital to release frozen gametes of a deceased man to his parents.The hospital did not yet release the preserved semen to the parents, whose son, aware of his terminal condition, left his semen in a cryopreserved state.Posthumous reproduction refers to the process of conceiving a child using assisted reproductive technology after the death of 1 or both biological parents.""Under the prevailing Indian law, there is no prohibition against posthumous reproduction if the consent of the sperm owner or egg owner can be demonstrated.If the deceased was married and had a spouse, the issues would not have been as complex,"" the judge noted. Contesting the ruling, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's Department of Health Research last week argued that the verdict ""rewrites statutory definitions to judicially create a new beneficiary class (""intending grandparents"") and treats cryopreserved semen as inheritable property devolving to legal heirs. ""A bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia told the Centre's standing counsel, Radhika Bishwajit Dubey that the govt will first have to explain the long delay in filing the appeal before deciding if it should be heard.The ministry contended that the single judge relied on foreign jurisprudence where explicit written consent was present, ""an element entirely absent in the present case"", and underlined that the dead man was unmarried and ""left no written informed consent for utilisation of his preserved semen sample.""""A child conceived through posthumous reproduction at the instance of grandparents would have no legally recognised parentage under the Acts, which contradicts the foundational legislative objective of protecting child welfare and ensuring certainty of parentage prior to conception,"" the ministry submitted in the appeal, arraying, apart from the parents of the dead man, the private hospital and Delhi govt as parties in the matter.""The ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) Act and the SRA (Surrogacy Regulation Act), constitute a complete code and limit eligibility strictly to commissioning couples/woman and intending couples/intending woman respectively, and within prescribed age limits. Parents do not fall within the statutory definition,"" the plea insisted, urging the HC to set aside the 2024 verdict, adding that the judge ""improperly elevated emotional considerations and subjective capability into enforceable legal rights. ""The 2024 order said that, in the absence of a spouse, there is no prohibition on posthumous reproduction, and directed the hospital to release to the parents the frozen sperm of their deceased unmarried son for surrogacy to continue his legacy.","The Union health ministry has challenged in Delhi high court its ruling asking Sir Gangaram Hospital to release the frozen semen of an unmarried dead man to his parents. The ministry's appeal asked two main questions: Can judges create new heirs, other than a spouse, for children conceived after death, and can gametes/sperm be treated like inheritable property that can be passed on to legal heirs without written consent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127827967,imgsize-7708,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-05-14-220545.jpg"

Over 800 NEET PG aspirants converted from Indian to NRI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-800-neet-pg-aspirants-converted-from-indian-to-nri/articleshow/127827163.cms,".

Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) that allocates postgraduate seats in various medical specialties has released a list of 811 candidates who have chosen to ""change their nationality"" from Indian to non-resident Indian (NRI) to get seats in the third round in 2025-26.Seats in NRI quota are the most expensive but that also means competition is less, with cut-offs lower than even for management quota. In effect, therefore, conversion to NRI gives those with low scores in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Postgraduate) but deep pockets a shot at getting seats in high demand clinical disciplines.The 811 candidates found to be eligible for conversion to NRI quota include two categories - those who actually are NRIs or children of NRIs and a second category of those who can show themselves to be wards of first degree or second degree relatives who are NRIs.There are 113 candidates in the first group and 698 in the second group.The lowest score among non-resident Indians in the first category is 82 out of 800, or just over 10%, while it is 28 (3.5%) in the second category.In the first category, 75 (66%) candidates scored less than 215, which means their rank is below 1.5 lakh.Over 60% (422) of 698 candidates in the second category of non-resident Indian are below 1.5 lakh rank.But with deep pockets, these candidates can afford the NRI quota fees for any specialty.Annual fees for NRI quota PG seats in a clinical specialty could be as high as Rs 45 lakh to Rs 95 lakh per year, depending on the specialty, state and on whether the medical college is a deemed university.If courts and the govt did not allow conversion of Indians to NRIs, many of the NRI quota seats would remain unfilled and would have to be converted into management seats where the fees would be much less.However, with even courts accepting the argument that private medical colleges cannot afford any financial loss, definition of NRIs has been expanded to allow candidates who don't have NRI parents or siblings to show themselves as a ward of near relatives, including NRI uncles, aunts or grandparents, who can sponsor them.","Seats in NRI quota are the most expensive but that also means competition is less, with cut-offs lower than even for management quota. conversion to NRI gives those with low scores in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Postgraduate) but deep pockets a shot at getting seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127827180,imgsize-8140,width-400,resizemode-4/over-800-neet-pg-aspirants-converted-from-indian-to-nri.jpg"

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Focus shifts to improving existing cities, says expert privy to 16th FC

New Delhi: With just two months to go for the award of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) to end (March 31), the Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years. Similarly, there has been little progress on checking air pollution in cities with a million-plus population.After the 15th Finance Commission headed by NK Singh recommended the challenge fund to incubate new cities as a pilot to promote planned urbanisation and ease pressure on existing cities, the housing and urban affairs ministry invited proposals and received 28 of them from 23 states. But it has so far not finalised even a single city for the purpose, having failed to complete the evaluation exercise.""This is one of the areas where the desired targets have not been met,"" said an expert.We have understood well that we need to improve our existing cities and urban areas rather than creating new ones. Naya Raipur is a live example for all of us,” said the expert privy to the deliberations of the 16th Finance Commission, led by Arvind Panagariya, whose recommendations will be tabled in Parliament on Sunday.The award of the 16th FC will cover the period from 2026-27 to 2030-31.The 15th FC had also designated the housing and urban affairs ministry as the nodal entity for grants to million-plus population cities for initiating measures to check air pollution by using mechanical sweeping machines, promoting non-motorised transport (pedestrian and bicycle) and paving side flanks of roads with facility for water percolation. The outcome of this exercise is awaited, with a report likely to be tabled in Parliament.Similarly, six years after the announcement to launch a new scheme to improve city bus availability, not a single bus has been deployed under the scheme yet. In Feb 2020, govt had announced that the Rs 18,000 crore scheme would facilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private sector players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses.The Economic Survey presented in Parliament this week mentioned that govt has launched PM e-Bus Sewa to strengthen city bus operations with 10,000 e-buses on a PPP model.It said, “Official status notes for FY25 report 7,293 e-buses approved across 14 states and four UTs, Rs 983.75 crore sanctioned for depots and behind-the-meter power infrastructure and Rs 437.5 crore already disbursed.” The report said that despite these measures, gaps in mass transit services persist. It added that housing and urban affairs ministry has recommended 40-60 buses per one lakh population; yet, many cities have far fewer buses. “Nationally, only about 47,650 buses serve its urban residents. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities. Due to the layout of urban roads, low bus availability combined with high private vehicle use reduces person throughput per lane kilometre, leading to congestion and longer door-to-door travel times,” the survey said.","The Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years.

New Delhi: Forty-nine districts across eight states - Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, UP and West Bengal - contribute a major share of construction workers engaged in highway projects across the country, according to a mapping of labour origins carried out by the National Highways Authority of India.In a first-of-its-kind exercise, NHAI has collated details up to the village level from where workers travel to highway construction sites, in a move to provide targeted skill training to these labourers. ""This will enhance their employability. Trained manpower in highway projects will help ensure timely completion and better quality of work. Training of people working at project sites is crucial,"" said an official.Officials said PM Modi recently directed the road transport ministry to undertake a focused skill development drive for labourers and supervisory staff by launching dedicated training courses.TOI has learned that a detailed framework is being prepared to train workers from these identified localities, and prominent ITIs, diploma colleges and engineering institutes have been shortlisted for the purpose. NHAI will sign MoUs with the institutes for training.It will also work closely with highway developers to implement the programme.People involved in the plan said while NHAI will provide a seed fund, highway builders are expected to contribute through their CSR funds. Trainees will receive a stipend during the training period to offset any loss of daily wages. ""Workers with 7-8 years of experience will be upskilled and developed as master trainers to train fresh manpower. The local NHAI project director will be in charge of implementation to ensure effective execution,"" an official said.He added that once trained, the workers will be able to get works anywhere and a better wage as well.Meanwhile, the highways authority is also preparing video training capsules on 50-60 topics that can be used to train workers.",National Highways Authority of India has collated details up to the village level from where workers travel to highway construction sites.

New Delhi: Supreme Court has slammed the income tax department and a former revenue secretary, who now is the governor of RBI, for systematically harassing an Army officer turned Indian Revenue Services bureaucrat for over a decade and imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on the authorities.Pramod Bajaj was commissioned as an officer in the Army in 1980 but was released because of disability he suffered as Captain during an operation. He cracked the tough civil services examination and was appointed to Indian Revenue Services in 1990 and rose to became Commissioner of Income Tax in Jan 2012.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said, “Notwithstanding his promotion to post of Commissioner of Income Tax and imminent probability for further promotion, a trumped-up memorandum was issued to him, which was ultimately dropped. However, taking shelter behind this subterfuge, the petitioner was compulsorily retired.”“The order of compulsory retirement was ultimately set aside by this Court in an earlier round of litigation vide the judgment dated March, 3, 2023, recording strong observations on the high-handed and mala fide manner in which the departmental action had been undertaken.”Referring to the former revenue secretary, now RBI governor , as ‘the Officer’ without taking his name, the bench said, “Though considering the fact that ‘the Officer’ now holds a sensitive position, we refrain from making any observations on his role in the entire sequence of events leading to the present litigation.”The bench imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on authorities payable to Bajaj. It also directed fresh selection of members of ITAT from among candidates that would include Bajaj.Bajaj’s troubles with the I-T department began in 2014 when he applied for appointment to the post of Member (Accountant) of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Search Cum Selection Committee (SCSC) headed by a sitting SC judge placed him at All India Rank One. But the department did not appoint him to the post, citing his litigation with his estranged wife.On the directions of the Central Administrative Tribunal, the department’s objections were placed before SCSC, which rejected them and maintained his All India Rank One. Appeal against the CAT order was dismissed by Allahabad HC and then SC. Undeterred and adamant, the department initiated a vigilance inquiry against Bajaj and put him in the list of officers with suspected integrity.This move too was set aside by the CAT. Appeal against this order was dismissed by the HC. Later the department initiated departmental proceedings and compulsorily retired him despite he being empanelled by ACC for the post of joint secretary.The apex court in a hard hitting judgment on March 3, 2023 quashed the proceedings against Bajaj and set aside order of compulsory retirement.Bajaj moved a contempt petition against the revenue secretary in 2024 and the court summoned him for deliberate defiance of SC orders. The revenue secretary tendered unconditional apology on Aug 4, 2024 and the court directed release of all consequential benefits to Bajaj.He was not appointed as an ITAT member but was called for a fresh interview before SCSC headed by a sitting SC judge.",Pramod Bajaj was commissioned as an officer in the Army in 1980 but was released because of disability he suffered as Captain during an operation.

Shaheen Malik

was an MBA aspirant when some jealous colleagues threw acid on her outside her workplace in Panipat, that left her blind in one eye and with a lifetime of surgeries. Sixteen years on, her attackers roam free and

Malik

is still explaining pain. To hospitals, courts, and a system that moves at its own pace. Malik, now 42, walked into the

Supreme Court

in Dec with a PIL to flag a blind spot in Indian law that leaves a small but acutely vulnerable group of acid attack survivors — those forced to ingest acid — without support. The hearing took an unexpected turn when the Chief Justice sought details of her trial, and called the delay a ‘national shame’. This week, the SC advocated tougher deterrents like attaching the accused’s assets to compensate victims. Malik spoke to

Mohua Das

about long waits for justice, patchy safeguards, and why survival demands more stamina than most people have.

Through your Brave Souls Foundation, you've seen how attackers face few consequences. Do you think these proposed measures can change that?

You went to court for

victims of forceful acid ingestion (VFAI)

, but the Chief Justice pulled up your own 16-year-old case and data from across states. Does it feel like justice is finally catching up or is it a reminder of what it takes to wake the system?

The law mandates free treatment to acid attack victims by both govt and private hospitals, and refusal is a punishable offence. Why does this still fail on the ground?

Is this free treatment meant to cover only emergency care, or does it extend to long-term and reconstructive treatment?

When did you realise that survivors forced to ingest acid were being completely excluded from the system, and why did it lead to this PIL?

Forceful acid ingestion is rarely discussed. How devastating is it for the body?

NCRB data shows cases rising again. Why do you think that is?

Acid sales are meant to be regulated. How easy is it to access acid even today?

What the Chief Justice said felt absolutely necessary. There should be punishment so people are afraid of committing such crimes. Right now, the accused roam freely. They get bail easily and face no real consequences. It has to be made difficult and painful. But saying it is one thing. Real achievement will be when this actually starts getting implemented. That is when conditions will truly start improving.The court could have limited itself to giving me relief only on the disability issue. Instead, it expanded the scope and raised larger questions around trials and deterrence. That gives me hope. Our judiciary should function like this consistently. We will keep filing PILs for survivors, but after CJI’s mandate, there should be clear directions on speedy trials, timelines, rehabilitation policies. That’s when change will actually happen.There’s absolutely no clarity. No private hospital gives free treatment to acid attack survivors, and frankly, they don’t want to.There’s no nodal officer, no coordination mechanism. The law simply says free treatment should be given, but when survivors go to hospitals, it’s outright refused. After that begins a long process. Once we approach the high court, the hospital suddenly says it is ready to give treatment “on humanitarian grounds”, but in reality, it is because of a court order. Even after that discrimination doesn’t stop. Survivors are made to wait for long hours, told beds aren’t available, even in big hospitals. Now imagine survivors without NGOs or lawyers. Who will actually get free treatment? Almost no one.In Parivartan vs Union of India in 2015, the court clearly said “full free medical treatment”. But that’s not how it works in reality. Govt hospitals are interested only in life-saving surgery. There are long queues, hygiene issues, and waiting periods of six months for a single surgery. If someone needs 40 surgeries, then 20 years of their life will pass. I myself have had 25. My left side still needs lifelong treatment but I’m tired. I don’t want any more surgeries.It was after the establishment of Brave Souls Foundation in 2021 that we were approached by VFAI survivors. When I began assisting these survivors with compensation and medical treatment, it became clear that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act entirely leaves out survivors who are forced to ingest acid. Their pleas for enhanced compensation are dodged and their disability is not recognised. That is why it became necessary to approach the court. If criminal law recognises this violence, beneficial laws must also recognise the resulting disability.This form of violence is rare but extremely brutal, often used as a method of torture, coercion or abuse, especially within domestic violence. The ingestion of acid causes immediate severe burns to the mouth, throat, oesophagus and stomach. Survivors experience extreme pain, difficulty swallowing, vomiting blood and swelling of the airway. Internal scarring can narrow the oesophagus, and require repeated surgeries. Many survivors cannot eat or drink normally and need feeding tubes.Most attacks are committed by jilted lovers or as a form of domestic violence. Many arise from family disputes or personal enmity. More cases are now being reported because people are beginning to speak up. But many acid attacks still go unreported.In Laxmi Aggarwal vs Union of India, the SC said acid sale must be regulated. But implementation on ground is zero. We have filed many RTIs most of which returned with NIL or NO as replies. Acid is very easy to procure and extremely cheap. It’s sold as bathroom or floor cleaner and shopkeepers rarely ask why it is being bought. Rs 20 worth of acid can destroy an entire life. That is what makes it such a dangerous weapon. At the very least, acid should be banned at retail shops. Even today, vendors sell it openly in residential areas including my own street.After a Delhi court acquitted the accused in your case citing lack of evidence, and after years of working with survivors, where do you see the system failing most?Poor investigation was a major reason my case collapsed. When the foundation of a case is weak, justice collapses. Besides that, the biggest gaps are lack of sensitivity and strict punishment. These are not ordinary crimes, but are treated like normal cases. Because of visible scars, survivors face discrimination in jobs, housing and social life. Many go blind and remain confined to their homes for years. Only three states—Karnataka, Haryana and Punjab—provide pensions. Even DLSA compensation, meant to be given within three months, is delayed for years. Survivors get exhausted and give up, or settle for a measly amount. Not everyone has 16 years or the resources to keep fighting.","Shaheen Malik, 42, was left blind in one eye and with a lifetime of surgeries.

GPF nominee can claim funds sans succession cert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gpf-nominee-can-claim-funds-sans-succession-cert/articleshow/127829458.cms,".

New Delhi: Noting that Centre itself had framed General Provident Fund (Central Service) Rules in 1960, which entitled a valid nominee of GPF account to receive the amount lying in it, Supreme Court has said that the nominee does not need to produce a succession certificate to withdraw the amount.A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Manmohan rejected an appeal filed by Centre which said that in case the account has more than Rs 5,000, a nominee has to produce a succession certificate. The Centre’s plea was earlier rejected by Central Administrative Tribunal and Calcutta high court on the same ground that Rule 33(ii) allows a nominee to withdraw the amount.“This Court declines to entertain the present Special Leave Petition as Rule 33(ii) of the Rules, 1960 has been framed by the Central Govt and the same cannot be and has not been challenged by the petitioners...This Court is of the view that if the submission of Govt of India is accepted, then the purpose of having a nomination would be lost. After all, the process of nomination has a sanctity attached to it,” the court said.It said that if a succession certificate is required in all eventualities, then it would render otiose all nominations made under the Provident Fund Act, 1925, read with the Rules, 1960.“This Court further finds that the basis of cases (where amount is more than Rs 5,000 in a/c) falling in Section 4(1)(b) and 4(1)(c)(i) is stated to be the amount standing to the credit of the depositor.While the basis of classification, namely, the amount of Rs 5,000 may have been substantial and reasonable in the year 1925, i.e., when the Act was passed, however, the same has ceased to be of any relevance a century later due to inflationary market forces. Recognising this ground level reality, the govt itself in the Rules framed thirty-five (35) years later stipulated that in cases of nomination, irrespective of the amount of money lying in the account, the same shall be released to the nominee,” it said.",The Supreme Court has said that the nominee does not need to produce a succession certificate to withdraw the amount.

New Delhi: The Union home ministry has made it mandatory for Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to serve a minimum two-year central stint as superintendent of police (SP) or deputy inspector general (DIG), to be eligible for posting as inspector general of police (IGP) in the Union govt.The rule will apply to IPS officers from 2011 batch onwards. The home ministry, in a letter sent to all state chief secretaries on Jan 28, directed that ""a minimum 2 years of central experience at SP/DIG or equivalent level shall be mandatory for empanelment of IPS officers at IG/equivalent level at the Centre from 2011 batch onwards"".The modified guidelines for empanelment of IPS officers for an IG-level or equivalent post at the Centre, are in line with existing guidelines for IAS officers. The latter make it compulsory for IAS officers to serve at the Centre for two years as deputy secretary, director or under-secretary, before they are empanelled for a joint secretary-level post in the Union govt.Apart from making available IPS officers allocated to different states cadres for filling up vacant posts in the central armed police forces (CAPFs) and central police organisations (CPOs) such as CBI, NIA and Intelligence Bureau, the new empanelment guidelines will ensure that IPS officers have a varied experience of having served both in their parent cadre and at the Centre early and mid-career, before they aspire for an IG-level deputation with the Union govt.As per the vacancy position in CAPFs and CPOs on Dec 23, 2025, 104 of the sanctioned 229 SP-level posts and 69 of the 256 sanctioned posts at the DIG level, are vacant.The last IPS batch allocated to various state cadres, to be empanelled for post of IG or equivalent, was 2007. The 2011 batch may be due for empanelment in the next three years or so, which gives them time to serve at the SP and DIG level at the Centre if they haven't served outside their parent cadre yet.Some states already experiencing shortage of SP and DIG-level officers may however find it difficult to spare more officers at this level, to fulfil the new eligibility criteria for empanelment as IG or equivalent at the Centre.","The rule will apply to IPS officers from 2011 batch onwards. The last IPS batch allocated to various state cadres to be empanelled for post of IG or equivalent was 2007. 104 of the sanctioned 229 SP-level posts and 69 of the 256 sanctioned posts at the DIG level, are vacant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127827925,imgsize-1260089,width-400,resizemode-4/ips.jpg"

Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint, says SC

New Delhi: In a significant departure from one-size-fits-all penalty approach, the SC has said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment and it would be justifiable to impose higher penalties on mega firms for environment damage caused by them, reports Dhananjay MahapatraThis decision by Justices Dipankar Datta and Vijay Vishnoi was given while dismissing appeals against orders of NGT imposing Rs 5cr penalty on Rhythm Country and Rs 4.47cr on Key Stone Properties for constructing residential and commercial projects without green clearance in Pune.Justice Datta rejected the arguments of the two realtors that the penalty imposed was disproportionate.The court also rejected the arguments that NGT did not have the jurisdiction or power to arbitrarily impose such high environmental damage compensation charges.Justice Datta said through the NGT Act the legislature has deliberately given the tribunal discretion to grant relief based on the seriousness of environmental harm.The core of appellant’s arguments was that turnover or project cost cannot be taken as a metric for determination of environmental compensation. “We are unable to accede to such a submission. Neither NGT Act nor the jurisprudence of this court calls for the adoption of a uniform formula for the quantification of environmental compensation,” the bench said.The Supreme Court further said that: “In cases relating to protection of environment, linking a company’s scale of operations (like turnover, production volume, or revenue generation) to the environmental harm can be a powerful factor for determining compensation.”“Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint. Larger scale means more resource use, more emissions, more waste leading to more environmental stress. If a company profits more from its scale, it is logical that it bears more responsibility for the environmental costs. Linking scale to impact sends a message that bigger players need to play by greener rules,” it said.",Supreme Court said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment. Justices Dipankar Datta and Vijay Vishnoi dismissed appeals against orders of NGT imposing Rs 5cr penalty on Rhythm Country and Rs 4.47cr on Key Stone Properties for constructing residential and commercial projects without green clearance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127827726,imgsize-42646,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-07-15-152225.jpg"

Who is Sunetra Pawar?

NEW DELHI: Sunetra Pawar was sworn in as Maharashtra’s first woman deputy chief minister on Saturday, stepping into public office days after the death of her husband, NCP leader Ajit Pawar , in a plane crash. She now faces the immediate challenge of leading the Nationalist Congress Party amid a period of political and personal upheaval.In her first public remarks after the tragedy, Sunetra Pawar said she was “overwhelmed with emotions” as she assumed responsibility in the state cabinet, adding that she would “carry forward the legacy” of her late husband and “continue to work tirelessly” for Maharashtra.Clad in a white saree, she took the oath amid chants of “Ajit Dada amar rahein,” in the presence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde.Sunetra Pawar hails from Tera village in Dharashiv district, earlier known as Osmanabad, in the Marathwada region. While she belongs to a political family, with her brother Padamsinh Patil being a senior NCP leader, she was not actively involved in politics for much of her life.Her father, Bajirao Patil, played a role in the Marathwada liberation movement that preceded the merger of the Hyderabad state with the Indian Union.This legacy shaped her early exposure to public life and social issues.A commerce graduate, Sunetra Pawar has interests in painting, music, photography, and agriculture. After her marriage, she took up farming in Katewadi village and became actively involved in agricultural work.She founded the Environmental Forum of India (EFOI), a non-governmental organisation focused on environmental awareness and sustainable living. Under her leadership, EFOI introduced the eco-village model in India, integrating ecological practices into rural development.A committed environmentalist, she has led campaigns on biodiversity conservation, protection of endangered species, water management, and drought mitigation. Her efforts earned her the “Green Warrior Award” in recognition of her contribution to environmental causes.Sunetra Pawar also serves as a trustee of Vidya Pratishthan, an educational institution established by Sharad Pawar.

He will also inaugurate the Terminal Building at Halwara Airport in Ludhiana, Punjab.On the occasion of the 649th Birth Anniversary of Sant Guru Ravidas Ji, the renaming of Adampur Airport honours the revered saint and social reformer whose teachings of equality, compassion, and human dignity continue to inspire India's social ethos.Further advancing aviation infrastructure in the state, the Terminal Building, to be inaugurated by the Prime Minister at Halwara Airport, will establish a new gateway for the State, serving Ludhiana and its surrounding industrial and agricultural hinterland. Located in the Ludhiana district, Halwara is also home to a strategically important Indian Air Force station.The earlier airport at Ludhiana had a relatively small runway, suitable for small-size aircrafts. To improve connectivity and accommodate larger aircraft, a new civil enclave has been developed at Halwara, which has a longer runway capable of handling A320-type aircraft.Aligned with the Prime Minister's vision of sustainable and environmentally responsible development, the terminal incorporates several green and energy-efficient features, including LED lighting, insulated roofing, rainwater harvesting systems, sewage and water treatment plants, and the use of recycled water for landscaping.The architectural design reflects Punjab's rich cultural heritage, offering passengers a distinctive and regionally inspired travel experience.Earlier, Bharatiya Janata Party's Punjab President Sunil Jakhar said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Dera Ballan on February 1, calling it a significant visit that reflects the Prime Minister's respect for Guru Ravidas and the sentiments of the people of Punjab.Jakhar said the Prime Minister's visit is taking place on a special day when the Union Budget is also being presented, underscoring the importance the Prime Minister attaches to faith and reverence.

188 million children living with obesity; WHO flags global health alarm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/188-million-children-living-with-obesity-who-flags-global-health-alarm/articleshow/127814581.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 188 million children and adolescents worldwide are living with obesity, the World Health Organization (World Health Organization) has warned, calling childhood obesity one of the fastest-growing public health crises driven by unhealthy diets, aggressive food marketing and environments that push junk food over nutritious meals.In its latest global guidelines on preventing obesity, the WHO says about 390 million children aged 5–19 years are overweight, including 188 million who are obese, putting them at high risk of diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses later in life.The UN health body warns that children today are surrounded by ultra-processed foods high in sugar, salt and fat, widely promoted through television, digital media and even school environments. Such exposure, it says, is shaping lifelong eating habits and fuelling a surge in obesity at younger ages.Calling for urgent action, the WHO urges governments to restrict marketing of unhealthy foods to children, improve the nutritional quality of food sold in and around schools, and ensure clear front-of-pack warning labels to help families make informed choices. It also stresses the need for healthier school meals, safe drinking water and regular physical activity as part of daily routines.The guidelines caution that obesity is no longer a problem limited to rich countries. Rates are rising sharply in low- and middle-income nations, where children face a double burden of poor nutrition and easy access to cheap, unhealthy food.Without strong policy intervention, the WHO warns, childhood obesity will continue to climb, placing a heavy long-term burden on health systems and cutting into future productivity. Preventing obesity early, it says, is far easier — and far cheaper — than treating lifelong disease.","UN health body warns that children today are surrounded by ultra-processed foods high in sugar, salt and fat.

NEW DELHI: NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday made a significant revelation about the future of the Nationalist Congress Party, saying that talks to merge the two rival NCP factions were already under way and had progressed to an advanced stage before the sudden death of his nephew and party chief Ajit Pawar Speaking at a press conference, Sharad Pawar said the proposed merger was not only under discussion but was also in line with Ajit Pawar’s own wishes.“Now we feel his wish should be fulfilled. Ajit Pawar, Shashikant Shinde and Jayant Patil had initiated the talks about the merger of the two factions. Even the merger date had been fixed — it was scheduled on the 12th (February). Unfortunately, Ajit left us before that,” Sharad Pawar said.This disclosure comes amid intense political activity in Maharashtra following Ajit Pawar’s death and reports that his wife, Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Pawar, is likely to be sworn in as deputy chief minister.Sharad Pawar, however, maintained that he had no prior information about her possible elevation, underlining that key decisions were being taken by leaders in Mumbai and not in consultation with him.When asked whether he, as a senior member of the Pawar family, was taken into confidence regarding Sunetra Pawar’s possible appointment as deputy chief minister, Sharad Pawar sought to downplay any suggestion of discord.“Family stands united if an issue occurs in the family. There are no issues in the family,” he said.Sharad Pawar made it clear that discussions on political and organisational decisions were taking place away from him.Responding to questions on the apparent haste in decision-making after Ajit Pawar’s death, he said, “All these discussions are not taking place here; they are happening in Mumbai. Praful Patel, Sunil Tatkare and other senior leaders are having these discussions. Whatever is being seen appears to be decisions taken by them. I will not comment on this.”","Sunetra Pawar likely to be sworn in as Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister, replacing her late husband and NCP chief Ajit Pawar in the state cabinet.

Food makers may have to keep daily production logs; stricter storage rules proposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/food-makers-may-have-to-keep-daily-production-logs-stricter-storage-rules-proposed/articleshow/127813111.cms,"NEW DELHI: To make food safer and more traceable, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has proposed new rules that would require food manufacturers to record what they produce and what raw materials they use every day, according to a draft notification issued in the Gazette.The proposed changes aim to improve hygiene, accountability and consumer safety, especially in processed and packaged foods.Under the draft rules, food manufacturing units will have to maintain daily records of production and ingredients, making it easier for regulators to track problems such as contamination, substandard ingredients or unsafe batches. Traders and distributors who do not manufacture food will not be covered under this requirement.The draft also seeks to enforce stricter storage practices. Food businesses will have to follow “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and “first-expire, first-out” (FEFO) principles, ensuring that older or near-expiry food is used or sold first. This is intended to reduce the risk of expired or unsafe food reaching consumers. Retail shops, however, have been kept out of this provision.FSSAI has invited public feedback for 30 days before finalising the rules.Officials say the move is part of a wider effort to strengthen food safety as India’s food market expands, and to give consumers greater confidence in the quality of food they buy.","Proposed changes aim to improve hygiene, accountability and consumer safety.

Owaisi Slams MCD Demolition, Says Turkman Gate Land Fully Belongs To Waqf

New Delhi: Supreme Court has said offering of prayers by Muslims at premises not included on the list of auqaf cannot give it the character of a mosque and ruled unless the mosque stood over waqf land, waqf tribunal could not entertain a suit to declare the place a mosque.The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008 but the owner of the land and the builder of the apartments stopped access to it in 2021.One Mohammed Ahmed filed a suit before the waqf tribunal seeking to restrain Habib Alladin and others from causing hindrance to those visiting the Mahmood Habib Masjid and Islamic Centre. The owner of the plot moved Telangana HC, claiming the building plan made no mention of the area in dispute as a mosque and, hence, the tribunal could not have entertained the suit. The HC had rejected the plea.After analysing judgments on the issue, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran said, “A reading of Section 6 and 7 (of Waqf Act, 1995) makes it clear that the jurisdiction, to determine whether or not a property is a waqf property, or whether a waqf is a Shia waqf or a Sunni waqf, inheres in the tribunal only if the particular property is specified as waqf property in the ‘list of auqaf’.”The bench said, “A bare reading of the plaint would indicate that neither is the property specified in the ‘list of auqaf’ as published in Chapter II nor registered under Chapter V and hence the decision as to whether the property is a waqf property or not cannot be decided by the tribunal since the property is not one specified in the ‘list of auqaf’, which is the mandatory requirement... to approach the tribunal.”SC said, “We will not consider the issue as to whether the property can be deemed to be a ‘waqf by user’ since the question is still at large.” It set aside the tribunal order assuming jurisdiction and the HC order affirming it.","The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008.

Lucknow: Akhilesh On UGC Rules, SC Stay Sparks Student Debate, Sambhal Police FIR Issue And More

New UGC norms silent on penalty for false complaints

New Delhi: A day after Supreme Court stayed UGC's Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, the education ministry began examining on Friday the removal of the “false complaints” clause that featured in the 2025 draft but was dropped from the final notified rules.Those from the general category have argued that in the absence of a deterrent, false complaints may be used to harass them. Opponents of the regulations pointed out that the new framework includes other backward classes — a category not covered under the 2012 regulations — leaving the general category “without remedies for discrimination faced by them”.While removing OBCs from the purview of the regulations may not be an easy option, sources said the Centre is examining whether safeguards against false complaints need to be restored and the ambit of the anti-discrimination mechanism be expanded to cover EWS.Supreme Court put on hold Thursday the regulations notified on Jan 13, taking serious exception to several provisions and observing that they could fuel societal divisions and have a dangerous impact on the goal of a casteless society.Sections 2 and 3(c) of the regulations, which define beneficiaries as “socially and educationally backward classes” and state that “caste-based discrimination” refers to discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs.Notably, OBCs were not mentioned in Regulation 3(c) of the draft but were added in the notified rules this year.The draft regulations provided for penalties against false complaints. The deleted provision stated that anyone filing a false discrimination complaint could face a fine determined by the equity committee, with repeat or serious violations potentially leading to disciplinary action under institutional rules.A senior govt official said, “This is being examined along with compliance with SC’s directions, including its observation on setting up a panel of experts to study the regulations.”The court flagged concerns around possible “segregation” of students. Section 7 of the regulations, dealing with measures for promotion of equity, states that any selection, segregation or allocation related to hostels, classrooms or mentorship groups must be transparent, fair and non-discriminatory.","Supreme Court stayed UGC's Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026.

New Delhi: Delhi high court on Friday questioned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) over the “indefinite” relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave, reports Abhinav Garg.Hearing a PIL that raised the issue, a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia sought an explanation as to why the aviation regulator deferred the implementation of the new flight-duty norms soon after introducing them. “What is the rationale for withdrawal of this? And this applies to all airlines,” the bench asked the DGCA counsel. The HC issued notice, giving DGCA two weeks’ time to respond.The new regulations mandate that “no leave shall be substituted by weekly rest”. On Dec 5, 2025, DGCA eased the Flight Duty Time Limitations to allow IndiGo to deploy more pilots on duty in order to reduce disruptions. The move came after IndiGo cancelled hundreds of flights nationwide in the first week of Dec after failing to prepare for the implementation of the new flight-duty norms for pilots.",The Delhi high court questioned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) over the ‘indefinite’ relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave.

New Delhi: Observing that doctors administering speculative, unproven or experimental treatments on patients amounts to professional misconduct and negligence, Supreme Court on Friday said stem cell therapy cannot be used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment and expressed displeasure that the Centre has not taken suitable action to prevent it.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan also directed putting in place rules, regulations and guidelines to govern stem cell-based clinical trials and research in the country.“A medical practitioner who administers speculative, unproven or experimental treatment even when credible professional bodies have expressly advised against the use of such an intervention, may be held liable on count of professional misconduct. We say so because the administration of such a treatment would fail to satisfy the standard of reasonable care necessitated under the established medical negligence jurisprudence in India,” the bench said.It said every medical practitioner owes to his or her patient a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care, skill and knowledge expected of a prudent practitioner in the field. “A medical practitioner cannot be said to meet the standard of reasonable care if he administers an intervention that lacks credible scientific evidence of safety and efficacy, or where authoritative medical bodies unequivocally state that such form of treatment is not recommended,” the bench said.The court noted that although stem cells administered for therapeutic use in ASD are characterised as “drugs” under the Drugs Act, 1940, yet the same by itself is not determinative of the fact that it is permissible to be administered as a clinical service. It said if a medical intervention is characterised as unproven, experimental, obsolete or lacking justification by the scientific community, then such an intervention cannot be allowed by doctors.“It is unfortunate that the Union has let the matter worsen without any suitable and timely intervention. Such inaction has led to several parents/guardians seeking an unproven method of treatment for their children suffering from ASD, incurring huge financial cost and in alternative to other approved treatments,” the Supreme Court said.It said, “It cannot be denied that various clinics, in flagrant violation of the statutory mandate, continued to recommend and perform stem cell therapy as a routine clinical treatment for ASD because there was lack of executive action against the same. Therefore, we urge the Union to consolidate and clarify the position of law for enabling better implementation of the same in this regard at the earliest.”","Stem cell therapy cannot be used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment.

Russia Backs India’s Energy Needs As Putin Defies Trump And Promises Steady Fuel Supplies To Delhi

New Delhi: Russian state-run atomic energy corporation Rosatom, during the India Energy Week in Goa, presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units — a unique Russian technology for countries like India with long coastlines and developed island territories.Rosatom also presented a comprehensive approach to solving problems in the field of nuclear energy and showed openness to the implementation of joint research projects.Russian company officials at the Goa event paid special attention to possibilities of scientific and technical cooperation based on multipurpose fast research reactor MBIR, which, after commissioning in 2028, will become the most powerful research reactor globally. India has also been invited to join an international consortium based on the reactor and participate in multilateral research programmes.“India is a strategic partner, cooperation with which has been building for many years and is aimed at developing nuclear and related industries. Joint nuclear projects form a solid technological and human foundation, designed for decades to come. The experience of implementing our flagship project, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, shows that we do not just work on individual tasks for the facility, but accompany the project throughout its life cycle, contributing to the industrial transformation of India,” Rosatom International Network CEO Egor Kvyatkovsky said.“We see great potential for deepening cooperation in both large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs) construction projects, as well as in non-energy areas such as nuclear medicine, isotope supply, joint research projects, additive technologies and digital solutions,” he said.Rosatom, which has been actively helping India build six 1,000 MW VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, is also discussing new areas of cooperation such as construction of Russian-designed low-power nuclear power plants (ASMMs) in India. ASMM technologies are focused on providing clean electricity to remote areas with limited network infrastructure, as well as energy supply to individual industrial enterprises.ENDSCaption: Rosatom is already helping India set up six nuclear reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu","Rosatom presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units.

What will the Railway Budget 2026 focus on? We take a look at possible points in FM Sitharaman’s speech:

Vande Bharat Sleeper

Amrit Bharat Trains

Kavach & Safety Focus



Railway Budget 2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced seven new high-speed, bullet train corridors spanning the Indian Railways network across the country as part of her Union Budget speech. This is the first time that the Budget is being presented on a Sunday.""In order to promote environmentally sustainable passenger systems, we will develop seven high speed rail corridors between cities as growth collectors,"" FM Sitharaman announced. The seven routes are:At present India does not have any functional high-speed or bullet train corridor. The first bullet train project is currently under construction between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.The first phase of this bullet train corridor within Gujarat is expected to be operational by 2027.Talking about infrastructure, FM Sitharaman said, “During this past decade, our government has undertaken several initiatives for large scale enhancement of public infrastructure, including through new financing instruments such as infrastructure investment trust. We shall continue to focus on developing infrastructure in cities with over five lakh population that is tier two, tier three cities, which have expanded to become growth centers.FM Sitharaman may announce yet another record capital expenditure allocation for Indian Railways in Union Budget 2026. In the last five years, railway budget allocations have grown exponentially, as the government focused on infrastructure as a driver of economic growth.Till 2017, the Railway Budget was presented separately. Suresh Prabhu was the last Railway Minister to present a separate railway budget in 2016. Since then railway allocations find space in the Finance Minister’s speech, but there is no separate speech or list of new trains announced. The Budget speech around railways tends to center around upcoming projects and long-term vision on passenger services, freight, and safety.At the start of this year, Indian Railways introduced the first Vande Bharat sleeper train service between Guwahati and Howrah. The new semi-high speed train set, capable of 160 kmph speeds, is aimed at overhauling overnight travel experience on the Indian Railways network. In the coming years hundreds of Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be rolled out, and FM Sitharaman’s speech may see plans for Vande Bharat sleeper trains being announced.Indian Railways says that Vande Bharat sleeper trains offer world-class comforts, with superior ride comfort compared to the existing premium trains like Rajdhani Express and Tejas Express. Cushioned berths, redesigned ladders, a host of passenger-friendly amenities, disabled-friendly features, faster travel experience and jerk-free rides are some of the top features of the Vande Bharat sleeper trains.The chair car version of the Vande Bharat trains is a popular service and as of December 2025,a total of 164 Vande Bharat train services are running across the Indian Railways network.Amrit Bharat trains are push-pull services with locomotives on both ends to enhance train speed. The trains for common man have sleeper and general coaches and there are plans to introduce them with AC coaches soon.Amrit Bharat services, which are at present fully non-AC trains, have 12 Sleeper Class Coaches and 8 General Class coaches, providing high quality services to the passengers, in many aspects similar to Vande Bharat trains. With a focus on common man services, new Amrit Bharat train plans may be announced.Indian Railways has recently commissioned 472.3 route kilometres of Kavach Version 4.0. Kavach is the indigenous Automatic Train Protection system. Kavach Version 4.0 is the most advanced version of India’s home-grown Automatic Train Protection system. It has evolved through technological improvements, drawing on field experience, operational feedback, and independent safety evaluations, according to Indian Railways. Cleared by the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), the system marks a significant leap in railway safety capabilities.The Kavach system combines microprocessor-based architecture, GPS technology, and radio communication to maintain safe train operations. When another train is detected on the same track within a defined safety distance, it alerts the locomotive pilot and, if necessary, automatically activates braking through onboard systems.With safety in focus, the Kavach rollout may also find mention in FM Sitharaman’s Budget speech.","FM Sitharaman may announce yet another record capital expenditure allocation for Indian Railways in Union Budget 2026.
