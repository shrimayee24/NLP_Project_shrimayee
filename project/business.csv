MUMBAI: Bullion markets in India and abroad continued to see hectic activity as prices of gold and silver rose to record levels in both markets. As jitters are being felt across markets, especially due to shortage of supply of the white metal, Tata MF temporarily suspended inflows into its silver ETF fund of fund (FoF). And outside of India, Bank of America raised its target for gold to $5,000/ounce, a rise of nearly 25% from current levels and $65/oz for silver, a 30% appreciation.The global supply crunch has hit the silver market at a time when the demand for the metal, used in industries like solar and EVs, is rising. In addition, rate cuts in the US, which is making the dollar cheaper against major currencies are also leading to higher demand for silver and gold.In international markets, since these metals are priced in dollar, a weaker greenback would translate to fall in prices of these two precious metals, leading to higher demand. In the domestic market, silver prices hovered close to the Rs 1.8 lakh/kg level, a new all-time peak, while gold traded at close to Rs 1.3 lakh/10gm level. Late on Monday, on MCX, the futures prices for gold for Dec delivery was at close to Rs 1.25 lakh while silver futures for Dec delivery was trading at close to Rs 1.55 lakh level.During the day, Tata MF suspended purchases, switchins, fresh SIPs etc into its Silver ETF FoF, effective Oct 14. Tata MF is the fourth fund to take this step to protect investors’ interest. Kotak MF was the first one, followed by SBIMF and UTIMF to take such a decision for their silver ETF FoF.","Bullion markets in India and abroad continued to see hectic activity as prices of gold and silver rose to record levels.

CHANDIGARH: In past few weeks, security agencies manning anti-drone systems along Punjab border began noticing a strange trend - drones from Pakistan would be detected and tracked, but would whirr back behind the fence before they could be brought down.ISI-backed smugglers in Pakistan routinely try to send arms, including AK-47s and grenades, and drugs, slung under drones, across the 532km-long border with Punjab. There was a lull in the immediate aftermath of Operation Sindoor, but it picked up after a few weeks. Detection and interception also rose on the Indian side as the three anti-drone systems (ADS) were strengthened.Now, these new drones have upped the cat-and-mouse game. ""Technology changes every day. What is happening now is that drones coming from Pakistan are largely programmed with a fail-safe mechanism with default settings of back-to-home. After sensing disruption in the signal between the drone and base station during our attempts to jam, lock, and neutralise them, the drones are programmed to return to the point where they took off,"" said a senior Punjab Police officer, describing it as ""a tech challenge"" in Punjab's war against Pakistan's ISI-backed smuggling network.The Indian anti-drone systems are up to the task as most attempts to smuggle arms and drugs via drones get detected, the officer said. ""The drones are either brought down or fly back across the border. Either way, it's foiled,"" he added. ""The detection rate is very high, eight or 10 a day, sometimes even 15,"" he said, adding: ""We need at least 100 such ADS for wider coverage of border areas.""Amid its ongoing 'Yudh Nashian Virudh', Punjab government deployed 3 vehicle-mounted ADS in the first phase, with an official launch by Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal in Tarn Taran on August 9. Punjab plans to deploy nine such systems at a total cost of around Rs 51 crore.Since deployment of ADS, Tarn Taran police have registered 12 FIRs and arrested as many suspects in Bhikhiwind subdivision alone for receiving contraband via drones. The haul includes four pistols, 75 bullets, five magazines, over 3kg heroin, 492g ICE, and 506g opium.Bhikhiwind DSP Preetinder Singh said: ""ADS has proved very effective in combating smuggling of drugs and weapons from Pakistan via drones. Earlier, we had to rely on sound to track drones. This technology gives us exact coordinates of the drone along with speed, altitude and other parameters."" ""Up to a certain range and distance, jamming can neutralise the drone. But sometimes, the drone is at such a distance that jamming is ineffective, even though it can be detected. Detection has helped us make recoveries and arrests,"" the DSP added.","ISI-backed smugglers in Pakistan routinely try to send arms, including AK-47s and grenades, and drugs, slung under drones, across the 532km-long border with Punjab.

"Lalu IRCTC scam 'fountainhead', says court as it frames charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lalu-irctc-scam-fountainhead-says-court-as-it-frames-charges/articleshow/124538106.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court framed Monday charges against former railway minister Lalu Prasad , his wife Rabri Devi, son Tejashwi Yadav , and 11 others in the alleged IRCTC scam that rigged railway hotel contracts for favoured private players.Rabri and Tejashwi prima facie emerge as participants in the criminal conspiracy of which Lalu Prasad was seemingly the ""fountainhead"", Special Judge Vishal Gogne said. The ""individual strands of the cheating"" between 2005 and 2014 were ""intrinsically interwoven"" with a larger network of collusion among multiple accused, he added.According to CBI , when Lalu was railway minister between 2004 and 2014, two BNR Hotels of railways - in Ranchi and Puri - were first transferred to IRCTC and then leased to Patna-based Sujata Hotels through a manipulated tender process. In return, land parcels in Patna were allegedly transferred at undervalued rates to Lalu's family through firms linked to the hotel owners. Investigators allege this quid pro quo formed the heart of the scam. CBI registered the FIR on July 5, 2017, and filed its charge sheet in April 2018. Court took cognisance of the final report on July 30, 2018, and prosecution sanction followed in July 2020.Those named in the charge sheet include former IRCTC group general managers VK Asthana and RK Goyal, and Sujata Hotels directors Vijay and Vinay Kochhar, who also own Patna's Chanakya Hotel.Two firms - Sujata Hotels and Delight Marketing Company (now LARA Projects LLP) - are among the accused.""You conspired for the undervalued purchase of land parcels. You conspired with other accused for the subsequent transfer of effective control over these land parcels to Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Yadav,"" Judge Gogne said while pronouncing the order. All accused, including the Yadav family, were present in court. The court said the transfer of land to Lalu's wife and son by ""commercial players"" suggested ""an instance of crony capitalism fostered in the guise of eliciting private participation"" in the operation of railway hotels. ""This conspiracy may be sublime but not entirely hidden from the court's view,"" the judge said.Judge Gogne said CBI had presented a ""cogent chain of evidence"" linking the accused, adding that the agency ""was possibly led by the stench to the rot"". He described Lalu's ""institutional awareness and possible intervention"" as the ""glue"" binding the conspiracy, calling the alleged quid pro quo ""a principal conspiracy among multiple persons"" from the start.Concluding that there was ""adequate substantiation"" of the allegations, the judge said the criminal conspiracy alleged by CBI is ""the thread"" connecting all accused - marking the start of trial proceedings in one of the country's most politically charged corruption cases.","A Delhi court framed Monday charges against former railway minister Lalu Prasad, his wife Rabri Devi, son Tejashwi Yadav and 11 others in the alleged IRCTC scam.

The message was sent to the Congress interlocutors as the opposition had been dragging its feet on names for the panel despite repeated reminders.The sole holdout, CPM , also gave its nod to the boycott on Monday after Congress reached out to persuade the Left ally.CPM MP John Brittas told TOI, ""We are for opposition unity. In that spirit, we are with other opposition parties on the issue of JPC.""While major anti-BJP parties headed by Congress were earlier keen to join the JPC, an uncompromising Trinamool Congress queered the pitch for the INDIA bloc by announcing in Aug that it would boycott the panel. It then drew support from SP, AAP and Shiv Sena.They argued that parliamentary panels were being used by the Modi government to bulldoze bills without considering the views of the opposition, citing the example of the Waqf Bill. The upfront announcement by key allies put Congress in a bind as it did not want to come across as breaking ""opposition unity"" for a legislation which anyway was jointly opposed by INDIA bloc.

Poll Do you think minority communities in Afghanistan should be given special representation in the government? Yes, it will ensure their rights and safety No, standard representation is sufficient

NEW DELHI: A delegation of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who left their homeland over the decades in the face of persecution and took refuge in India met Taliban foreign affairs minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy on Monday and requested that the current regime in Afghanistan facilitate a joint delegation of prominent Hindus and Sikhs leaders from India for the restoration and maintenance of historical gurdwaras and temples located there.The delegation is learnt to have also sought easing of requirements for Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who are now Indian nationals so that they can visit like before without having to apply for a visa, as many would want to go back for business if the regime there ensures safety for minorities.They also sought that the Afghanistan government (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) must consider appointing and engaging Afghan national Hindus or Sikhs in their mission in India too, as this will strengthen the bilateral relations.“As during the previous regime, minorities were given representation in the government and considering the same, at least two persons - one each from the Hindu and Sikh community should be appointed to high-ranking positions in the government,” the delegation conveyed as per a statement issued after the meeting. They also sought restoration of property rights and estate of minorities which were grabbed during the previous regime.The delegation, led by Afghan Minorities Council in coordination with the Indian World Forum, comprised around 30 prominent Hindus and Sikh members of the community who came to India over the decades and many of them now hold Indian citizenship.Indian World Forum President Puneet Chandhok said, “we hope that the present regime will ensure foolproof rights of minorities living there.”After the meeting, Guljeet Singh, a prominent voice from the community, told TOI that “The foreign minister assured us that he will take up all our concerns back home.” Singh said that there are about 5,000 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Delhi. While most have acquired Indian citizenship, there would still be around 2,000 people who are Afghan nationals.The exodus over the decades has led a large number of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to India and from here to various other countries like the United States, Canada, UK and Germany among other countries.",A delegation of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs met Taliban foreign affairs minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy on Monday.

"India going for German-origin submarines, may scrap project for more French ones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-likely-to-scrap-french-scorpene-project-may-go-for-german-origin-subs/articleshow/124540593.cms,"NEW DELHI: India may scrap the proposed project to build another three French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Docks (MDL), while it goes full steam ahead with the plan to construct six new German-origin diesel-electric stealth submarines at the same facility for over Rs 70,000 crore.The plan for the three additional Scorpene submarines, which would have cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “is not being pursued now”, though the “final decision to scrap it has not yet been taken in black and white”, top govt sources have told TOI.While cost negotiations for the three more Scorpenes concluded in the last fiscal itself, the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) is “on hold” because the German submarines are considered “a generation ahead” of them, the sources added.“Moreover, it would be difficult for MDL to handle two different complex submarine-building projects simultaneously,” a source said. The three new Scorpenes were to add to the six such submarines already built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’, which was inked way back in Oct 2005.The first, INS Kalvari, was commissioned in Dec 2017 after much delay and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, in Jan this year. All the six Kalvari-class submarines will, however, be retrofitted with the air-independent propulsion (AIP) system being developed by DRDO for greater underwater endurance.AIP gives a diesel-electric submarine the stealth capability to remain underwater for around two weeks, while a boat without it must surface or `snorkel’ every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge its batteries.The German submarines to be constructed at MDL under `Project-75India (P-75I), in partnership with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), will have AIP, land-attack cruise missiles and other new-generation technologies.The decision to take forward the final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines -- with the option for another three of them at a later stage -- was taken after extensive deliberations among the defence ministry, Navy, the National Security Council Secretariat and others, the sources said.Consequently, the official contract talks for MDL to build the six German submarines began last month. “These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” another source said.Considering France’s expansive strategic partnership with India, there is however still the possibility that the case for three more Scorpenes could be revived if there is top-level intervention.Sources, on their part, say France should be pleased that it is on course to bag several other major projects. For one, the govt-to-govt deal for additional Rafales under the IAF’s around Rs 2 lakh crore project for 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA), in which the bulk of the jets will be manufactured in India, is now in the works, as was reported by TOI.For another, the collaboration to co-develop a new powerful jet engine with French major Saran – at a cost of Rs 61,000 crore -- for India’s fifth-generation stealth fighter called AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft) has also been virtually finalized.Amid all this, the Navy is keeping its fingers crossed. Apart from the six Scorpenes, the Navy is left with just six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines in its conventional underwater fleet. It also has two nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic missiles.China, incidentally, has over 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines. It is also supplying eight new Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines with AIP to Pakistan in what will be a major capability jump for the latter.","The plan for the three additional Scorpene submarines, which would have cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “is not being pursued now”, top govt sources have told TOI.

Poll Do you support the government’s Rs 6.4 trillion transmission plan for hydroelectric capacity in the Brahmaputra basin? Yes, it’s a positive step for sustainable energy No, I have concerns about environmental impact

China begins construction of dam on Brahmaputra



NEW DELHI: The Union government has prepared a Rs 6.4 trillion ($77 billion) transmission plan to transfer more than 76 gigawatts of hydroelectric capacity from the Brahmaputra basin by 2047 to meet rising electricity demand, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) said on Monday.In a report released on Monday, the CEA said the plan includes 208 large hydro projects across 12 sub-basins in the northeastern states, with 64.9 GW of potential capacity and an additional 11.1 GW from pumped-storage plants. ""In view of the substantial hydroelectric potential identified within the Brahmaputra basin, it was felt to have a comprehensive transmission system plan for evacuation of power from this assessed potential. Consequently, a transmission system master plan has been formulated for the evacuation of 65 GW of hydroelectric generation capacity from 12 sub-basins of the Brahmaputra basin,"" the CEA said in the report.The Brahmaputra River, which rises in Tibet and flows through India and Bangladesh, has significant hydro potential in its Indian stretch, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh near the China border.The basin’s transboundary nature and proximity to China make water management and infrastructure planning a strategic issue, amid the government's concerns that a Chinese dam on the Yarlung Zangbo (the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra river) could reduce dry-season flows on the Indian side by up to 85 per cent.The Brahmaputra basin covers parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, and West Bengal, and holds more than 80 per cent of India’s untapped hydro potential, the report said. Arunachal Pradesh alone accounts for 52.2 GW, news agency Reuters reported.Phase one of the plan, running until 2035, will require Rs 1.91 trillion, while phase two will cost 4.52 trillion rupees, according to the CEA, as cited by the Reuters.India aims to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by achieving 500 GW of non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2070.China began building a major dam on the Brahmaputra in southeastern Tibet in July, near the border with India. Premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony.India had raised concerns about the project earlier this year. In January, the ministry of external affairs said, ""China has been urged to ensure that the interests of the downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas.""","The Brahmaputra River, which rises in Tibet and flows through India and Bangladesh, has significant hydro potential in its Indian stretch.

The move comes just a day after US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor met PM Modi and held discussions with Agrawal. “During my visit to India, I met with commerce secretary Agrawal & discussed US-India economic ties, including increased investment in US,” Gor posted on X Sunday.US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor’s post indicates Trump administration is also nudging Indian companies to commit to investing in the US, a move meant to strengthen the President’s claims that his tariff actions and negotiations with countries have resulted in investment commitments that add up to $17 trillion, a number that is facing scrutiny.While some Indian IT companies are looking to set up offices and hire more locally, a handful of Indian players have invested in the US.So far, the discussions were focused largely on India slashing import duties, including on farm products, in return for getting a favourable “reciprocal tariff” for its exports. Besides, Trump has cited India’s purchase of Russian crude to impose a crushing 50% tariff, which has hurt Indian textiles, gems and jewellery and leather and footwear players.The 25% reciprocal tariff on India, which came after Indian negotiators held their ground on not allowing American corn and soybean and genetically modified food, is higher than several competitor countries.

Delhi government plans ride-hailing service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-government-plans-ride-hailing-service/articleshow/124540849.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Delhi government plans to launch the city's first ever cooperative ride-hailing service, aiming to offer drivers an alternative to corporate platforms while providing passengers more affordable, surge-free options.Officials said the service would ensure drivers retain 100% of their earnings, wherein they don't have to pay any commission to cab aggregators. Officials of the registrar cooperative society have been tasked with preparing a detailed blueprint to take the plan forward.Cooperative minister Ravinder Indraj announced the initiative during the annual general meeting of Delhi Citizen Cooperative Bank on Sunday, describing it as part of govt's larger effort to ""revitalise the cooperative movement in the city with new direction and energy"".Speaking to TOI on Monday, Indraj said, ""I have asked officials to prepare a feasibility report and develop a framework so Delhi can get cooperative taxi-hailing service. The details are being worked out, but we intend to roll it out soon.""Delhi's scheme draws inspiration from the Sahkar Taxi cooperative currently being developed in Maharashtra and other states, a concept championed by the Union ministry of cooperation.Earlier this year, Union home minister Amit Shah announced plans for a cooperative taxi service across the country that would include registration of two-wheelers, taxis, rickshaws and four-wheelers under a single umbrella. The profits generated would be shared equitably among driver-members, bypassing corporate intermediaries.In Delhi, the proposed service will operate through a dedicated app, connecting passengers directly with driver-members of the cooperative. Unlike conventional corporate-run ride-hailing firms, the platform will be owned and managed by the drivers themselves. This model seeks to eliminate commission charges, promising fair and transparent pricing.""The main objective is to uplift taxi drivers by improving their income, working conditions and overall quality of life. By making drivers active members and stakeholders, govt hopes to build a sustainable model that benefits drivers and consumers alike,"" said an official.Passengers, too, stand to gain from the cooperative framework, with promises of reliable service, transparent fares, and no unexpected price surges. ""This approach aims for a win-win scenario where drivers enjoy social security benefits and fair profit-sharing, while commuters get affordable rides,"" the official added.Maharashtra's Sahkar Taxi is expected to start operations by Dec 2025. Delhi's model will be tailored specifically to the capital's unique needs and commuting patterns, said Indraj. ""Our service won't be an exact replica of Maharashtra's, but will be designed to suit Delhi's conditions,"" he told TOI.The official said the app will directly connect passengers with drivers. The cooperatives will govern the platform, maintain transparent fare slabs, and ban algorithmic price hikes. Delhi govt will also facilitate necessary regulatory clearances to smooth the rollout, he added.Taxi industry representatives have welcomed the move. Sanjay Samrat, president, Delhi Taxi and Tourist Transporters Association, said, ""Cab aggregators take up to 40% commission on every ride, severely cutting into drivers' earnings. When these firms were launched, their commission was zero, but that has changed drastically.""Samrat said the cooperative scheme should allow the registration of both existing and new CNG vehicles. ""Forcing drivers to switch only to electric vehicles will be difficult because of high cost and limited profitability,"" he said, urging govt to provide affordable loans to drivers to buy vehicles.","Delhi government plans to launch the city's first ever cooperative ride-hailing service.

Source: LinkedIn

Applying Ritz-Carlton lessons to Everhaus Group’s corporate leadership



From bellboy to CEO: Abel Ariza’s leadership journey







Abel Ariza, the CEO of Singapore-based Everhaus Group, began his professional journey far from the boardroom. At the age of 23, he worked as a bellboy at the Ritz-Carlton Barcelona, managing luggage for some of the world’s most prominent figures, including Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, Leonardo DiCaprio , and Mariah Carey. While the role may have seemed humble, it became a formative period that instilled critical values in Ariza: discipline, humility, and the importance of valuing people, teamwork, resilience, and adaptability in dynamic environments, lessons that proved invaluable in navigating complex business challenges later in his career.Each interaction offered a lesson in human connection. Handling luggage and attending to guests taught him the significance of presence, attentiveness, and professionalism—qualities that would later shape his leadership philosophy at Everhaus Group.Among the many memorable experiences, Ariza highlighted his encounter with Leonardo DiCaprio as particularly impactful. The actor broke hotel protocol to allow Ariza access to the guest elevator. After assisting him with his luggage, DiCaprio handed Ariza leftover casino chips and said, “Keep it. Build something you believe in.”This gesture left a lasting impression on Ariza. It reinforced the importance of pursuing personal ambitions, believing in one’s vision, and recognising that small acts of encouragement can have a profound impact. Beyond the symbolic value, this moment served as an early guidepost for Ariza’s approach to business leadership: empowering others, fostering trust, and valuing initiative.Other high-profile encounters also shaped his understanding of leadership. Bill Clinton, despite fatigue from travel, personally greeted every staff member, teaching Ariza the power of presence and recognition. Nelson Mandela, who requested his coffee at precisely 6:15 AM, exemplified the role of discipline in achieving broader goals. Even Mariah Carey’s humour and acknowledgment of his efforts demonstrated the importance of empathy, respect, and human connection in building meaningful relationships.Today, as the head of Everhaus Group, operating across Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam, Ariza draws directly on the lessons from his time at the Ritz-Carlton. He emphasises purpose-driven leadership, cross-cultural collaboration, and genuinely valuing people. Whether in luxury hotel corridors or corporate boardrooms, Ariza applies the same principles of attentiveness, discipline, and humility that guided his early career.Ariza’s approach underscores that leadership is not just about authority or decision-making; it is about seeing and acknowledging every individual. By prioritising people, he creates a corporate culture built on trust, motivation, and long-term engagement—echoing the ethos he absorbed from his interactions with global leaders and celebrities.Beyond this singular hotel encounter, Leonardo DiCaprio’s broader work as an actor and philanthropist has also left a lasting impression on Ariza. Known for films such as Titanic, The Revenant, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Inception, DiCaprio is also a committed environmental activist, founder of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, and a United Nations Messenger of Peace. The actor’s dedication to purpose-driven action and creating global impact mirrors the principles Ariza now applies in business leadership.Ariza’s story has resonated with thousands on LinkedIn, where readers emphasised that true leadership begins in small acts of presence, recognition, and discipline. Many noted that even brief encounters with influential figures can shape long-term professional and personal growth. Reflecting on his journey, Ariza wrote, “I built Everhaus on the same principles I learned at the Ritz—discipline, humility, and seeing people, not positions. ”The journey from bellboy to CEO illustrates a powerful truth: early career experiences, combined with guidance from iconic figures, can form the foundation of effective leadership. By integrating humility, attentiveness, and human connection into corporate strategy, leaders can create environments where individuals thrive and organisations succeed.","Abel Ariza worked as a bellboy at the Ritz-Carlton Barcelona at the age of 23.

Konstantin Galish’s death linked to crypto market crash





Ukrainian crypto influencer Konstantin Galish, 2, was found dead inside his Lamborghini in what police believe may be a suicide. Police authorities said he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and the weapon found beside him was registered in his name. In a Telegram post, Kyiv Police said “On the eve of his death, the man informed his relatives about his depressed state due to existing financial difficulties, and also sent them a farewell message.”Konstantin Galish, 32, was a Ukrainian crypto entrepreneur and co-founder of the Cryptology Key Trading Academy. He rose to prominence as one of Ukraine’s most-followed digital asset influencers, sharing trading insights on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs across social media platforms such as YouTube and Telegram.Known online as Kostya Kudo, Galish built a reputation for simplifying complex crypto concepts for retail investors and frequently discussed market trends, risk management, and blockchain adoption. His trading academy, Cryptology Key, attracted thousands of members across Eastern Europe, positioning him as one of the region’s rising crypto educators.Beyond his business ventures, Galish was also recognized for his philanthropic efforts, having donated significant sums to Ukraine’s military and humanitarian relief projects since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Investigators have linked his death to the recent global cryptocurrency market crash, during which Galish reportedly lost around $30 million of investors’ money. Police have ruled out foul play for now but are also probing possible links to extortion and business disputes.“According to the specified fact, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Part 1 of Art. 115 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — premeditated murder with the additional mark ""suicide"". Currently, a pre-trial investigation is ongoing, all the circumstances of the event are being clarified,” the post reads.The tragedy allegedly came just days after the crypto market saw one of its sharpest crashes in years. On October 10, the global market lost about $19 billion in value within hours, triggered by US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese tech exports and tighter software export rules.Bitcoin dropped 8.4% to $104,782, while Ethereum fell 6.7%.

AI embedded across JPMorgan



Big AI bets under scrutiny







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently gave a clear warning about the disruption power of artificial intelligence. Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles. As reported by Business Insider, In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”Dimon also talked about layoffs and he did not shy away from the workforce implications. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also revealed that JPMorgan has been integrating AI since 2012. He said that AI now touches every part of the bank starting from rest and fraud detection to marketing and customer service. The bank also used AI for idea generation. he bank’s proprietary large language model, trained on internal data, is used by 150,000 employees weekly. “It’s quite productive,” Dimon noted. “Our managers and leaders have to do it. ”Dimon’s remakes come at a time when skepticism is growing about the massive corporate spending spree on AI. Meta is planning to spend around $600 billion on AI infrastructure by 2028. On the other hand, OpenAI and Oracle have announced a $500 billion data center project dubbed Stargate.A recent Goldman Sachs report warned that many firms investing billions in AI have yet to see measurable returns. “AI technology is exceptionally expensive,” said Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “Even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles.

Real-world application matters more than technological supremacy







Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US-China artificial intelligence competition, arguing that the race has no definitive winner because success should be measured by adoption speed rather than model superiority. ""When it comes to AI, there's no such thing as winning the race. It's a long marathon,"" Tsai said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September, with recordings posted Wednesday. He emphasised that the AI race isn't about who builds the biggest or most powerful model — it's about who can deploy AI faster.Tsai said the US should focus more on adoption and diffusion of AI instead of spending billions on developing larger models. He argued that ""every week there's a model that's leading, but then the next week another model overtakes them,"" making model superiority a fleeting achievement.The contrasting strategies between the two nations highlight fundamental differences in AI development philosophy. US tech companies have been spending billions, with Meta expecting to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure through 2028, while OpenAI and Oracle announced plans for a $500 billion data center project.Meanwhile, China's AI play focuses on lean, efficient models — cheaper, lighter, and easier to deploy. DeepSeek's R1 model, which disrupted the AI industry and US stock market earlier this year, rivals top competitors but was built at a fraction of the cost.Tsai highlighted China as an example of faster adoption, noting companies are embracing open-source and smaller models optimised for real-world use on mobile devices and laptops.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar concerns about America's adoption pace. Huang said China's under-regulation at the industrial level makes the country ""quick in adopting new technology,"" with the country aiming for 70% AI adoption by 2027.""I'm not saying China technologically is winning in the model war, but in terms of the actual application and also people benefiting from AI, it has made a lot of development,"" Tsai stated.Instead of trying to outbuild leading players like OpenAI, China focuses on rolling out AI across everyday tech at breakneck speed, which could prove just as crucial as model quality in determining overall AI competitiveness.",Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US- China artificial intelligence competition. He argued that the race has no definitive winner because success should be measured by adoption speed rather than model superiority. Tsai said the US should focus more on adoption and diffusion of AI instead of spending billions on developing larger models.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124523852,imgsize-22608,width-400,resizemode-4/file-image-ians.jpg"

The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy, particularly in technology, healthcare, and academia, helping to fill key skill gaps and drive innovation. Recently, the Trump administration has signalled sweeping reforms beyond the previously proposed $100,000 mandatory fee, which has raised significant concerns among current H-1B holders, prospective applicants, and industry stakeholders. According to a note from the US Department of Homeland Security titled “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program,” the administration is considering multiple changes, including revising eligibility for cap exemptions, increasing oversight of employers with prior violations, and tightening regulation of third-party job placements, as widely reported. These proposals are expected to be formally published in December this year, potentially reshaping application processes, affecting international talent mobility, and impacting US competitiveness in the global workforce landscape.Weeks before the proposed rule changes, President Donald Trump announced that employers would be required to pay a $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa application. This declaration caused immediate panic among the Indian diaspora and other foreign workers on H-1B visas.Many visa holders and their families, who were temporarily outside the US for work or travel, scrambled to return within 24 hours to avoid being stranded or denied entry. The situation eased slightly when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the fee would be a one-time charge applicable only to new petitions and not an annual cost. Despite this clarification, the proposed restrictions continue to generate concern among employers and employees alike, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on foreign talent.H-1B visa holders are not limited to tech roles; roughly a third work in essential sectors such as healthcare, education, religious services, and academia, as highlighted in a recent lawsuit challenging the reforms. Tech companies, in particular, fear that the reforms could disrupt hiring practices, limit access to high-skilled talent, and make the US less competitive on a global scale.Several prominent tech leaders began their US careers under the H-1B visa system, demonstrating its crucial role in fostering innovation and economic growth.Satya Nadella, born in Hyderabad, India, moved to the US in the early 1990s. He secured an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft, where he rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2014. Nadella has consistently highlighted the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, emphasizing that many of Microsoft's most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through the H-1B program.Sundar Pichai, originally from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, moved to the US for higher studies. After completing his education, he transitioned to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai has emphasized that immigration has been instrumental in America's technological leadership and Google's success, and he has publicly advocated for policies that expand opportunities for skilled immigrants.Aravind Srinivas, born in Chennai, India, moved to the US for higher education and later transitioned to an H-1B visa. He is the founder and CEO of Perplexity AI, a company specializing in generative AI. Despite challenges posed by immigration policies, Srinivas underscores that the US remains a meritocratic environment where talent and innovation are recognized. He emphasizes that the primary challenge for immigrants is not the increase in H-1B visa fees but finding trustworthy mentors and investors.Jayshree Ullal, originally from London and New Delhi, moved to the US at 16 to pursue higher education. She began her career on an H-1B visa and rose through several top tech companies to become CEO of Arista Networks. Ullal has been a vocal advocate for the H-1B visa program, emphasizing its importance in attracting global talent to the US She has also highlighted the challenges of the US immigration process, noting the long wait times for permanent residence approvals.Arvind Krishna, hailing from Dehradun, India, moved to the US in the 1990s on an H-1B visa. He steadily advanced to become CEO of IBM. Krishna has consistently advocated for the US to remain an international talent hub, stressing that global collaboration and access to foreign talent are essential for innovation and economic competitiveness.The H-1B visa programme has historically enabled the United States to attract some of the world’s brightest minds, driving innovation and economic expansion across multiple sectors. As proposed reforms take shape, leaders like Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Aravind Srinivas, Jayshree Ullal, and Arvind Krishna illustrate the tangible benefits of such a programme. Any policy changes must strike a careful balance between national interests, global competitiveness, and the livelihoods of millions of skilled workers who contribute to the US economy.","The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy.

What has made cyber attacks more dangerous





The National Stock Exchange (NSE) reportedly faces approximately 170 million cyberattacks daily, necessitating a dedicated team of ""cyber warriors"" to ensure seamless operations. ""Every day, millions of cyberattacks target the NSE, but our technical teams, supported by advanced systems and specialized software, combat these threats round the clock,"" a senior NSE official told PTI. The official noted that the exchange encounters 150 to 170 million cyberattacks daily, posing a significant challenge for its teams and systems.Recently, a group of journalists from Jammu and Kashmir visited the NSE to observe its management facilities, cyber defense centers, and backup systems. The NSE’s twin cyber defense centers operate in constant battle mode, equipped with upgraded software to neutralize and repel large-scale attacks on the financial market infrastructure 24/7, year-round. ""The robust cybersecurity architecture, combining tech-savvy personnel, machines, and technology, ensures the safety of NSE’s operations,"" the official told PTI.To bolster security, the NSE mandates Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) for all trading members and staff to maintain system integrity.During 'Operation Sindoor,' a DDoS simulation, the NSE recorded an unprecedented 400 million cyberattacks in a single day, the highest ever. Despite this, attackers failed to cause damage due to the coordinated efforts of personnel, machines, and advanced technology. A DDoS attack floods a server with traffic from multiple sources, aiming to crash or make it unavailable to legitimate users, a critical threat to industries like the stock market that rely on uninterrupted operations. As a precaution during this period, the NSE temporarily restricted access to its website for foreign users.Maharashtra Cyber had identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike in April this year. Of these, only 150 attacks were reportedly successful. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%. The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported.The NSE leadership said that a breach could impact not only the exchange’s systems but also ""whatever is connected to us,"" highlighting the ripple effect of digital vulnerabilities across interconnected networks. Officials said that growing global interconnectedness and system complexity have heightened the risk of large-scale cyberattacks, posing a significant threat to financial market stability. They further noted that the potential for low-cost, large-scale cyberattacks on financial market infrastructure remains a major global risk.","The National Stock Exchange (NSE) reportedly faces approximately 170 million cyberattacks daily.

Equally significant is the outperformance of PSU banks ( Nifty PSU bank index up by 16.77%) and the huge underperformance of IT ( Nifty IT down by 16.5%). ”“One common feature in these trends is the valuation.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Punjab border drones: ISI-backed smugglers’ drones whirr back behind fence; anti-drone systems foil most attempts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjab-border-drones-isi-backed-smugglers-drones-return-when-tracked-anti-drone-systems-detect-most-attempts/articleshow/124542538.cms,"



CHANDIGARH: In past few weeks, security agencies manning anti-drone systems along Punjab border began noticing a strange trend - drones from Pakistan would be detected and tracked, but would whirr back behind the fence before they could be brought down.ISI-backed smugglers in Pakistan routinely try to send arms, including AK-47s and grenades, and drugs, slung under drones, across the 532km-long border with Punjab. There was a lull in the immediate aftermath of Operation Sindoor, but it picked up after a few weeks. Detection and interception also rose on the Indian side as the three anti-drone systems (ADS) were strengthened.Now, these new drones have upped the cat-and-mouse game. ""Technology changes every day. What is happening now is that drones coming from Pakistan are largely programmed with a fail-safe mechanism with default settings of back-to-home. After sensing disruption in the signal between the drone and base station during our attempts to jam, lock, and neutralise them, the drones are programmed to return to the point where they took off,"" said a senior Punjab Police officer, describing it as ""a tech challenge"" in Punjab's war against Pakistan's ISI-backed smuggling network.The Indian anti-drone systems are up to the task as most attempts to smuggle arms and drugs via drones get detected, the officer said. ""The drones are either brought down or fly back across the border. Either way, it's foiled,"" he added. ""The detection rate is very high, eight or 10 a day, sometimes even 15,"" he said, adding: ""We need at least 100 such ADS for wider coverage of border areas.""Amid its ongoing 'Yudh Nashian Virudh', Punjab govt deployed 3 vehicle-mounted ADS in the first phase, with an official launch by Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal in Tarn Taran on Aug 9. Punjab plans to deploy nine such systems at a total cost of around Rs 51 crore.Since deployment of ADS, Tarn Taran police have registered 12 FIRs and arrested as many suspects in Bhikhiwind subdivision alone for receiving contraband via drones. The haul includes four pistols, 75 bullets, five magazines, over 3kg heroin, 492g ICE, and 506g opium.Bhikhiwind DSP Preetinder Singh said: ""ADS has proved very effective in combating smuggling of drugs and weapons from Pakistan via drones. Earlier, we had to rely on sound to track drones. This technology gives us exact coordinates of the drone along with speed, altitude and other parameters.""

Clear messaging to Pakistan



Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in



Economics, connectivity and regional stakes



Security calculus: Terrorism and recognition



Presence restored, recognition withheld



Regional balancing act



Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

Expecting resentment from staff, Clarkson instead found kindness, efficiency and unexpectedly good hospital food. The treatment, though painful, worked — and he left deeply appreciative.

Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about” during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics. A national paradox laid bare: Britons may grumble about long waits and systemic flaws, yet trust in the NHS remains strong — a sentiment Clarkson now shares firsthand.

Bottom line:





For a man who’s made a career out of roaring engines and roaring opinions, Jeremy Clarkson has always reserved a special kind of scorn for the NHS. He’s called it bloated, broken and outdated — a “creaking monster” swallowing Britain’s money and happiness whole. But fate, with its impeccable comedic timing, decided to put his rhetoric to the test. Just nine hours after his latest tirade against the health service hit breakfast tables, Clarkson was racing to an NHS hospital himself, clutching more than just his pride. And there, lying in a gown that left his backside exposed to the world, Britain’s most bombastic motoring mouthpiece was forced to admit a humbling truth: for all its flaws, the NHS still works when you need it most.In his Sunday Times column, Clarkson once again attacked the NHS as an outdated, cash-devouring institution in need of a total rethink. But later that same day, a sudden medical emergency meant the broadcaster had no choice but to rely on the very system he had just ridiculed. With private treatment hours away, he checked into an NHS hospital in Oxford, bracing himself for hostile nurses and bitter tea. What he got instead was professional care, spotless facilities, and a recovery that left him quietly — if reluctantly — grateful.Clarkson’s abrupt change of circumstances mirrors the conflicted relationship many Britons have with the NHS: it’s easy to criticise when you’re healthy, but when illness strikes, there’s no substitute for it. His experience serves as a reminder of the health service’s enduring value — not as a perfect system, but as a vital public institution that delivers when it counts.A swift dose of irony: Hours after deriding the NHS as a “bottomless abyss”, Clarkson became a patient, forced to trust the system he had just dismissed.Jeremy Clarkson hasn’t turned into an NHS evangelist, but his hospital dash has quieted his trademark complaints. It’s hard to sneer at a “creaking monster” when it’s the very thing that put you back on your feet.","Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about’ during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics.

Focus on trade and investment





NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal in a bilateral meeting, while also focusing on efforts to deepen their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and in areas like technology, defence co-production and security.Modi also raised the issue of anti-India activities by Khalistan separatists. While the PM himself did not bring up the issue in his media remarks after the meeting, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said later that the PM emphasised radicalism and violent extremism had no space in democratic societies and “in particular should not be allowed to use the freedoms or abuse the freedoms provided by democratic societies”. It is understood that the issue of extradition of Indian economic figities was also discussed.He also said that the PM underlined the need to move against them within the legal frameworks that are available to both sides.Modi, who announced an agreement for cooperation in military training under which IAF flying instructors will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force, said India and the UK are natural partners as their relationship is built on the shared values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.“In today’s time of global uncertainty, our growing partnership stands as an important pillar of global stability and economic progress,” said Modi in a joint press statement with Starmer after their meeting.Defence, in fact, was a major focus area in the meeting with the leaders endorsing an Intent to finalize an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on cooperation in developing maritime electric propulsion systems for Indian Naval platforms. Another agreement for supply of Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) systems to support India’s air defence capabilities was also announced. According to a joint statement, this agreement, in the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat, will meet the current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence, and support a long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.Both leaders agreed to work closely in promoting reformed multilateralism, including reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), as Starmer reiterated UK’s long-standing support for India’s “legitimate aspirations for permanent membership in a reformed UNSC”.Modi and Starmer focused on ramping up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific too as they committed to, according to the joint statement, robust maritime security collaboration in the region, including establishment of the Regional Maritime Security Centre of Excellence (RMSCE) under the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).Recalling the “historic” Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) that India concluded with the UK in July, Modi said this agreement will reduce import costs between the 2 countries, create new employment opportunities for youth, boost trade, and benefit both Indian and UK industries and consumers.He said there are immense possibilities in the technology partnership, including in critical and emerging technologies, between India and the UK. “We are working to connect the UK’s industrial expertise and R&D with India’s talent and scale. Last year, we launched the India–UK Technology Security Initiative. To connect the youth of both countries through an innovation bridge, we have taken several steps, including establishing the Connectivity and Innovation Centre and the Joint AI Research Centre,” he said.The leaders also announced the setting up of a UK – India Critical Minerals Processing and Downstream Collaboration Guild to build concrete partnerships which “strengthen and diversify critical mineral supply chains and deliver investment and growth in both nations”.“Our defense cooperation has also deepened. We are moving towards defense co-production and connecting the defense industries of both countries. Taking our defense collaboration a step further, we have signed an agreement for cooperation in military training, under which Flying Instructors from the Indian Air Force will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force,” he said.Both leaders looked forward to an early ratification of the India–UK CETAThey welcomed the resetting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) which will support the governance and utilisation of the CETAFocus on construction, infrastructure and clean energy, advanced manufacturing, defence, education, sport, culture, financial and professional business services to realise the benefits of FTABoth Prime Ministers reiterated their commitment to improving connectivity and enhancing cooperation in the aviation sector.","PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal.
