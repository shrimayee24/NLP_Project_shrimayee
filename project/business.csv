Government allays fears of significant mpox surge in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-allays-fears-of-significant-mpox-surge-in-india/articleshow/112579767.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has reported 30 laboratory confirmed cases of monkeypox since January 2022: the latest being a case from the state of Kerala.According to the sources in the Union health ministry , there hasn't been any significant surge in cases of the infectious viral disease and the future risk of surge also remains low.Nonetheless, a senior official who did not want to be quoted said, government is mulling steps for extra-vigil in view of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) recent decision to declare the infectious disease a public health emergency of international concern.Steps being mulled include increased vigilance at airports and seaports since most of the cases reported so far had a history of travel to countries where the cases are significantly higher.According to WHO, monkeypox is a viral zoonosis - a virus transmitted to humans from animals - with symptoms like smallpox although clinically less severe. Monkeypox typically manifests itself with fever, rash and swollen lymph nodes and may lead to a range of medical complications.It is usually a self-limited disease with symptoms lasting for two to four weeks. The 'Guidelines on Management of Monkeypox Disease' issued by the Centre, in 2022 stated that human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through large respiratory droplets generally requiring prolonged close contact. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with body fluids or lesions, and indirect contact with lesion material such as through contaminated clothing or linen of an infected person.Animal-to-human transmission may occur by bite or scratch of infected animals or through bush meat preparation. The incubation period is usually from six to 13 days and the case fatality rate of monkeypox has historically ranged up to 11 per cent in the general population and higher among children. In recent times, the case fatality rate has been around three to six per cent. The symptoms include lesions which usually begin within one to three days from the onset of fever, lasting for around two to four weeks and are often described as painful until the healing phase when they become itchy.",India has reported 30 laboratory confirmed cases of monkeypox since January 2022. The latest was a case from the state of Kerala.

"Pakistan ties in deep freeze, poll announcement won't matter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-ties-in-deep-freeze-poll-announcement-wont-matter/articleshow/112576435.cms,"NEW DELHI: The announcement of elections in J&K is unlikely to have any impact on India-Pakistan ties which remain in a deep freeze since India revoked the special status of the erstwhile state, or even well before that.With the Supreme Court having upheld the repeal of the special status, India believes the question about whether Pakistan has a locus standi in how the Indian govt chooses to run the internal affairs of what is now a Union Territory is already settled.On the limited issue of territory, both countries will continue to maintain their clearly stated and uncompromising positions.Islamabad, on the other hand, will continue to insist that elections and return to statehood, both of which the Supreme Court had sought in its ruling, cannot be a substitute to people's right to self-determination. However, delaying the elections any further would likely have been used by Pakistan to buttress the theory it has clung to that the situation in J&K isn't normal.SC's order asking for elections to be held could have allowed an opening for the two sides to work towards restoring at least a semblance of normalcy in the relationship but Islamabad has officially maintained there can be no forward movement till India reverses the revocation, rejecting calls from within Pakistan to resume trade ties with India.Unlike in the past, there's hardly any pressure on India from its western partners to engage Pakistan in the name of peace, allowing the Indian govt to resolutely maintain Pakistan must take tangible measures against cross-border terrorism for any dialogue to take place. That Pakistan complicated the relationship further by unilaterally recalling its high commissioner after the change in Kashmir's status has only worked in India's favour, justifying its position that any initiative for a breakthrough has to come from Islamabad.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif's elder brother Nawaz Sharif, whom Narendra Modi once called a ""friend"", did reach out with a message to seize the opportunity, after Indian PM won his third term in office, to ""shape the destiny of the two billion people of south Asia"" but for India it's more important that Pakistan first reinstate its high commissioner to set the ball of diplomacy rolling.In his response to Nawaz, Modi had spoken about the need to ensure the well-being and security of the people, underlining India's position that Islamabad has to first create an atmosphere free of terror for dialogue. The recent terror attacks have also exacerbated India's concerns about terrorism, as obvious from his message to the ""patrons of terrorism"" across the LoC that their sinister plan would not succeed. Naming Pakistan, Modi had said it had not learnt anything from history and was trying to remain relevant through terrorism and proxy war.",The announcement of elections in J&K is unlikely to have any impact on India- Pakistan ties which remain in a deep freeze. India believes the question about whether Pakistan has a locus standi in how the Indian govt chooses to run the internal affairs of what is now a Union Territory is already settled.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112576677,imgsize-1682364,width-400,resizemode-4/112576677.jpg"
IIT-Bombay relaxes punishment of 8 over 'offensive' play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-bombay-relaxes-punishment-of-8-over-offensive-play/articleshow/112579328.cms,"MUMBAI: Two months after penalising eight students for staging an 'offensive' play - Raahovan - during the institute's Performance Arts Festival (PAF), IIT Bombay has relaxed the quantum of punishment imposed on them.After the appeal, the fine of four students, who graduated this year, has been brought down to half - from Rs 1.2 lakh to Rs 60,000. The permanent suspension from hostel facilities for four junior students has been reduced to six months.Most in the latter group, however, did not get any relaxation in their fine amount of Rs 40,000.PAF is an annual cultural event that was held in March this year, and the play was staged on the campus on March 31. The play, loosely based on the Ramayana , depicted the lead characters in a 'derogatory manner', claimed complaints from a section of students. The institute took action based on recommendations of a disciplinary action committee (DAC) after the complaints. The committee held a meeting in May, and the directive was passed in a letter dated June 4. Many found the penalties 'harsh'. The institute, however, allowed the students to appeal against the order. After the appeal, the punishments were relaxed in the first week of Aug.A source from campus said the junior students, though relieved with relaxation of the permanent suspension, got a raw deal in the episode.""They are not only paying the fine of Rs 40,000, but they will also have to rent out a place outside the campus for six months. The students are expected to pay hostel charges as part of their semester fees, and now the rent is an additional financial burden. They will also have to eat out as the directive mentions they will be suspended from all hostel facilities, including the mess,"" said the source.The students appealed to IIT Bombay's administration after they received the letters in June. A few institute professors and some alumni also came out in their support.The students apologised to the administration for unintentionally causing hurt to people's sentiments, said the source, adding that DAC, from the beginning, did not clarify what exactly was objectionable in the performance.'Loss of hostel residence facility for a definite period of time' has been listed as one of the 'major' disciplinary actions in the three categories enlisted in DAC rules. A senior institute official confirmed the quantum of punishment has been reduced but did not give details. Earlier, the institute had mentioned that the punishments will not affect the students' academic career.A video of the play had gone viral a few days after it was staged, sparking a debate on artistic freedom and hurting religious sentiments. The names of lead characters were slightly changed, and some found the portrayal of the lead characters, allegedly shown abusing each other, and the female lead praising the negative character in the video, offensive.","The fine of four students, who graduated this year, has been brought down to half.

Besides, the EC added, the high requirement of forces in J&K did not leave scope for adding Maharashtra in the schedule announced on Friday.Explaining why Maharashtra polls have not been timed along with Haryana elections, as was the case in the past, CEC Rajiv Kumar said the term of Haryana assembly is ending on November 3, 2024, while that of Maharashtra concludes only on November 26, 2024.Since J&K polls were due this time around and had to be held before September 30, Haryana had to be brought forward as EC would otherwise need to announce it in the midst of J&K poll. Had EC waited until after October 4, the time was not enough to have the new Haryana assembly in place before November 3. ""So the only option was to hold the J&K and Haryana polls together,"" the CEC said.A source said Maharashtra polls may be announced shortly after the assembly elections in J&K and Haryana are completed. In all probability, the assembly poll in Jharkhand, where the term of the current assembly is expiring on January 5, 2025, will be brought forward and synced with Maharashtra election.Addressing a press conference here, Kumar said heavy rains in Maharashtra had led to delays in updation of the voters list in the state, which is considered as a crucial step in the electoral process.""There was heavy rainfall in Maharashtra, booth level officers have to complete their work. There are several festivals too that have to be factored in. Ganesh Festival, Pitru Paksha, Navratri, Diwali, all that put together, this is what we thought we could handle as two elections at a time,"" the CEC said.

SSLV-D3 lifted off from the first launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota at 9.17am and, 13 minutes later, injected two satellites EOS-08, an earth observation satellite, and SR-0 Demosat into a 475km circular low-earth orbit.""The mission is almost a 100% success,"" said Isro chairman S Somanath. ""With this, our SSLV programme is complete. Now we've to manufacture and launch the rocket for commercial purposes."" Isro is exploring two routes for this. One is through NSIL, which will fund and realise the rockets required for commercial purposes, and the other is through technology transfer, which InSpace will handle.SSLV, a 34m rocket (PSLV is 44m) that weighs 119 tonnes, can launch satellites of 10kg to 500kg mass into a 500km planar orbit. Isro officials said the rocket is designed for low turnaround time, costs less, is flexible in accommodating multiple satellites, has feasibility for launch on demand and requires minimal launch infrastructure. SSLV had its first developmental flight on August 7, 2022. ""It was a near miss,"" said the Isro chairman. ""The orbit we achieved was slightly shorter. We made corrections, and the second flight went very well. And now, the third.""The Isro chief said a team will identify an industry consortium that will work with Isro for two years to understand the technology and realise two vehicles, which will be launched by NSIL. After that, the technology will be open for industry. ""We have cataloged the skills the industry must possess. RFI outlines criteria like manufacturing ability, facility capability, and financial strength, with weighted marks for each. Companies will be shortlisted based on these criteria, and contract will be awarded for a technology transfer fee.""The chairman said the second spaceport in Kulasekarapattinam, being built for SSLV launches, will be ready in two years. The Sriharikota spaceport will handle launches to orbits that require the rocket to fly eastwards.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery : a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs.The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the distant past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists study dinosaur fossils to learn about their behavior, diet, and appearance. Fossilized bones, teeth, footprints, and even eggs have been found, offering insights into these ancient creatures. There were over 1,000 different species of dinosaurs identified so far, ranging from the plant-eating sauropods to the fierce carnivorous theropods, showcasing their incredible diversity.Did you like this article?

The Union Cabinet , chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , on Friday sanctioned the crucial Thane Integral Ring Metro Rail Project (IRMRP) corridor, officials informed.The Maharashtra Metro Railway Corporation Limited (MMRCL) will undertake the project, which will be its inaugural greenfield venture in the metropolitan region. TOI had reported on August 7 that MMRCL was in the final stages of appointing design consultants for the project.""...It is our constant endeavour to ensure Maharashtra gets modern infrastructure.Today, the Union Cabinet has cleared the Thane Integral Ring Metro Rail Project. This is a landmark infrastructure project which will link key areas in and around Thane, as well as enhance comfort and convenience,"" PM Narendra Modi said in a post on X.Chief minister Eknath Shinde expressed gratitude towards PM Modi, home minister Amit Shah, Union minister of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, and former MoHUA minister Manohar Lal Khattar for their support of this project. ""...The Thane metro will largely improve connectivity within the city. We have done extensive follow-up with the Centre to get the project approved,"" he said on X.Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also expressed gratitude to PM Modi for the approval. ""Tremendous news for Maharashtra! Thank you Hon PM Narendra Modi ji … ₹12,200 crore for Thane Integral Ring Metro… The project will significantly reduce traffic congestion and in turn will benefit in cleaner environment and accelerate further development,"" he said on X (formerly Twitter).Officials stated that the project promises to resolve the current commuting difficulties encountered by the city's residents, as the 29-km long route with 22 stations running along the western side of the city would link distant areas of the city with the new and old Thane railway stations within an hour. Approximately 26 kms of the route will be elevated, while the remaining will be underground.The project is scheduled to commence operations by 2029 and will connect the remote residential and commercial hubs of Thane city like Wagle Estate, Ghodbunder, Kolshet, and Saket with the old and new railway stations, while also providing a vital link to Mumbai and Kalyan via the ongoing metro lines 4 and 5. Among the 22 stations, the new and old Thane railway stations will be constructed underground.According to the plans, each of the 6-coach rakes, with an estimated carrying capacity of 1,500 passengers, will operate in both directions at an interval of roughly 15 minutes, completing the loop within an hour. The planners anticipate that the project will result in a total daily ridership on the metro corridor reaching 8.72 lakh passengers by 2045.The ₹12,200 crore project will be jointly financed by the state and central governments, with funds also being raised through the sale of station names, access rights for corporations, monetization of assets, and value capture financing routes. The project is also expected to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a statement released by the central government.""The MMRCL will promptly initiate preparations for floating the tenders. The Thane IRMRP will benefit millions of daily city commuters, particularly those from distant locations of the city, by offering a faster and more economical transport option. The route will also connect major business hubs and provide an efficient transport option for its employees as well,"" said the MMRCL.","The Maharashtra Metro Railway Corporation Limited (MMRCL) will undertake the project, which will be its inaugural greenfield venture in the metropolitan region.

Govt approves 2nd airport for Patna with civilian enclave at Bihta; Bagdogra new terminal also gets nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-approves-2nd-airport-for-patna-with-civilian-enclave-at-bihta-bagdogra-new-terminal-also-gets-nod/articleshow/112574249.cms,"NEW DELHI: Patna will finally get a hugely-delayed second civilian airport at the nearby Bihta IAF base. A terminal building that can handle 50 lakh passengers annually will be built along with associated infra at a cost of Rs 1,413 crore in phase one so that the defence base can have a civilian enclave — like several other airports like Goa Dabolim, Ghaziabad Hindon and many others.Subsequently, the civilian enclave’s capacity will be doubled to handle 1 crore passengers annually.The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) chaired by PM Modi on Friday approved the Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) proposal to develop a new civil enclave at Bihta, the Union aviation ministry said in a statement Friday. The CCEA also approved AAI’s proposal to develop a new civil enclave at Bagdgora Airport, Siliguri, West Bengal at an estimated cost of Rs 1,549 crore. The new terminal at Bagdora will one able to handle upto 3,000 passengers per hour and have an annual capacity to handle 1 crore passengers.The existing Patna airport is constrained as its runway can’t be extended due to non-availability of space. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has in the past often warned airlines against operating big planes full there. For safety reasons, the regulator has often directed airlines to fly a single aisle like A320/B737 plane to Patna full but have to fly out of there with 15% seats vacant.The long-standing demand for Patna’s second airport for Patna, with Bihta being seen as the only viable option, has finally been granted. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar is a crucial ally for the Central government.AAI had in 2016 proposed to develop a civil enclave at Bihta. Indian Air Force had given its consent in April 2016 for commercial flight operations from Bihta.Regarding Bihta, the statement said: “This infrastructure project represents a strategic move to address the anticipated saturation of capacity at Patna Airport. While AAI is already in the process of constructing a new terminal building at Patna Airport, further expansion is constrained by limited land availability. The proposed new integrated terminal building atBihta Airport spans 66,000 square metres and is designed to handle 3,000 peak hour passengers (PHP) and annually cater to 50 lakh passengers,” the statement said.“This will be further expanded by another 50 Lakh whenever it is required and ultimate capacity would be one crore passengers per annum. Key components of the project include the construction of an apron capable of accommodating 10 parking bays suitable for Airbus A-321/320 and Boeing B-737 type aircraft, as well as two link taxiways,” it added.Regarding Bagdogra, the statement said: “The proposed terminal building spans 70,390 square metres and is designed to accommodate 3000 peak hour passengers, with an annual capacity to handle 1 crore passengers. Key components of the project include the construction of an apron capable of accommodating 10 parking bays suitable for A-321 type aircraft, as well as two link taxiways and multi-level car parking.

When did you hear the news and who first wished you?

At first, people overwhelmingly supported Kantara, now the

national awards

. Has this increased your responsibility?

There are reports you outperformed superstar

Mammootty

to bag this award. What do you have to say about this?

What is your reaction to the national awards recognising strides made by Sandalwood?

BENGALURU: The overwhelming reception, both from the masses and the critics, had made Rishab Shetty 's Kantara a strong contender for the major honours at the National Film Awards . The jury's decision to choose Kantara as the best popular film providing wholesome entertainment and its lead actor, Rishab, for the best actor award is in consonance with the acclamation the movie received across languages and national frontiers.Rishab spoke to TOI within hours of the announcement of the awards, saying it was all the result of teamwork.Regardless of being an actor or director, the credit must go to the entire Kantara team as each one of them has contributed immensely to this success. As I've been saying since the beginning, I dedicate this to Appu sir ( Puneeth Rajkumar ), Daiva (the folk dieties of Tulunadu), daiva nartakas (ritual dancers) and their families, and to all Kannadigas for their support throughout the journey.There were rumours and many were calling me to ask for a reaction. I refused to comment as there was no official word. I heard it from the selection committee as I watched their press conference on television. My wife Pragati was the first one to wish me, and many others in the industry, including Yash sir, conveyed their wishes.Your biggest reward comes from the people. If they accept and hail your work, it will be like a crown on the head. A national award and any other recognition are only feathers on that crown. Previously, when we had won national awards, we had greater responsibility, and the same has doubled now. But it is entirely a team effort and I couldn't have accomplished all this alone. We need good writers, production houses, artists, technicians, and a team to achieve all this. I'm happy we ( Sandalwood ) have that team and definitely we'll work together to bring out more creative works.I really don't know about this. I also saw it on social media. I don't know which movies were before the jury to judge. They (Mammootty sir and others) are all legendary actors, I don't even have the energy to stand in front of such legends. I believe the jury has considered the character in the movie and picked that character for the award. If there were such legends in the race, I consider myself the luckiest.I'm happy that we (Sandalwood) are able to reach that level. Happy to see that such barriers are broken and the creative hard work of artists from here is being acknowledged. This, in fact, gives us the even bigger challenge of delivering the best works in the days to come.","Rishab spoke to TOI within hours of the announcement of the awards.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Harris proposes federal price gouging ban: Will it curb inflation or create new challenges? Plan sparks debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harris-proposes-federal-price-gouging-ban-will-it-curb-inflation-or-create-new-challenges-plan-sparks-debate/articleshow/112579392.cms,"Food prices have surged by over 20% under the Biden-Harris administration , pushing many Americans to stretch their budgets further at the grocery store. In response, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a federal ban on price gouging across the food industry at a campaign event on Friday.“My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules,” Harris said.However, some economists warn that Harris' proposal could create new challenges. Gavin Roberts, chair of Weber State University’s economics department, studied anti-price gouging laws enacted during the pandemic and observed that such measures often prompted consumers to buy more than they typically would, exacerbating shortages.“When prices are high, the best policy action is often no action at all,” Roberts said reported CNN, explaining that consumers deterred by high prices of items like beef might switch to other proteins, helping maintain stock levels for those willing to pay more.Harris claims her proposal will foster competition within the food industry, but Roberts argues it may instead maintain the status quo by deterring new competition that could lower prices in the long run. Jason Furman, a former top economist in the Obama administration, echoed this concern, labeling the proposal as ""not sensible policy"" with potential downsides for consumers.Despite the critiques, Harris’ campaign fact sheet indicates that the plan also includes increased resources for federal agencies to combat price-fixing and anti-competitive practices in the food industry. Campaign staff declined to comment on the criticisms, referring instead to Harris’ speech and the fact sheet.The debate over the causes of inflation in recent years remains unresolved. While the San Francisco Federal Reserve found no strong link between price gouging and inflation, progressive think tanks argue there may be a direct connection.Lindsay Owens, executive director of the progressive Groundwork Collaborative, supports Harris' proposal, stating that it would empower agencies like the Federal Trade Commission to ""crack down on bad actors"" and ensure fair pricing for consumers. “It’s good to see this aggressive approach,” Owens told CNN.As the discussion around Harris’ proposal continues, the question remains: will this new policy curb rising food prices or create more economic hurdles?","Vice President Kamala Harris announced a federal ban on price gouging at a campaign event on Friday.

""He was a force on the track and off, with a personality as big as his list of accomplishments.""The plane that Bloomquist was flying crashed into a barn, and the remains of its sole occupant are believed to be that of Bloomquist, the Hawkins County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The National Transportation Safety Board said in its own statement that it is coordinating with the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the crash of the Piper J3C-65.Reid Millard, a fellow race car driver and a funeral home director in Missouri, stated on Facebook that Bloomquist's mother asked him to announce the death. ""Along with Scott's daughter Ariel his parents his sister and along with all of you who knew and loved Scott - you are in our hearts and prayers,"" Millard wrote.In dirt-track racing, drivers have to steer right for the car to go left. Going through turns, the front left tire comes off the track and the left rear tire provides traction.The cars weigh about 2,300 pounds and supply 800-plus horsepower. At Eldora Speedway, the Ohio racetrack owned by Stewart, the cars reach top speeds of about 150 mph.The vehicles have two-speed transmissions and no windshields, only short plastic shields to protect drivers from rocks. It can be a rough, contact sport.""Rubbing is racing,"" said Gerald Newton, president of the National Dirt Late Model Hall of Fame, in a phone interview with The Associated Press. ""It's door to door. You're slinging it sideways and slinging dirt.""Bloomquist was in the 2002 class of the hall of fame. Newton said Bloomquist was like an older brother to him and had known the racer for nearly 40 years. He also designed Bloomquist's official merchandize as senior vice president at Arizona Sport Shirts.Bloomquist was born in Iowa and later lived in California, where his father worked as an airline pilot, Newton said. The family wanted to move east and purchased the farm in Tennessee.Newtown said Bloomquist got into racing through a car that his father bought but soon lost interest in, passing it along to his son.""He would do work for people, make a little bit of money to buy a tire, go win a race,"" Newton said. ""He'd take that money, reinvest in the team. The rest is history.""Besides winning, Bloomquist became known for being cocky and kind of a bad boy, Newton said. His persona was somewhat built around the skull that was painted inside the zero on his race car.In the year 2000, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote Bloomquist ""looks like Tom Cruise, drives like Dale Earnhardt and speaks out like Darrell Waltrip.""Waltrip was a NASCAR driver who aggravated his competitors by beating them on the track and then running his mouth out of the car.""He always told me it's not boasting or bragging if it's fact and you can back it up,"" Newton said of Bloomquist. ""And he did.""Newtown said Bloomquist's accolades ""will never be exceeded.""""The world has lost a great racer, a great friend, a great dad,"" Newton said. ""And heaven has gained a great angel.""Like a lot of drivers in the sport, Bloomquist suffered various injuries over the years. But he was still racing and planned to compete in next month's World 100 at Eldora Speedway.""He still felt like he could win a race,"" Newton said.","Scott Bloomquist, 60, died in a plane crash on his family's farm in Mooresburg, Tennessee.

"Kamala Harris: MAGA calls Harris 'Comrade Kamala' after she promises price-control 'like Venezuela, Cuba'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-calls-harris-comrade-kamala-after-she-promises-price-control-like-venezuela-cuba/articleshow/112576071.cms,"'Price grouging is like pornography. You know it when you see it'

Vice President Kamala Harris Friday unveiled her economic plan promising tax cuts for the middle class, expand child tax credit, federal ban of price gouging. The Trump campaign in response called Kamala Harris Comrade Kamala and said price controls exist in Soviet, Venezuela.“Her policies rival some of the most socialist and authoritarian models from world history.Instead of unleashing American energy and reducing the burden on our people, she would impose price controls that are something out of Venezuela or Cuba,” senior Trump campaign adviser Brian Hughes told reporters.Harris’ plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. She said she would ban price grouging which is stopping sellers from inflating the prices. Harris promised to work toward construction of three million new homes to “end the housing shortage” within a four-year time frame, offering a first-ever tax incentive to people building starter homes.Columnist Catherine Rampell wrote in Washington Post that -- before the unveiling of the plan -- no one knows what price grouging means. ""That’s the thing about price gouging: As has been said of hardcore pornography, you know it when you see it,"" she wrote.""It’s hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is. It is, in all but name, a sweeping set of government-enforced price controls across every industry, not only food. Supply and demand would no longer determine prices or profit levels. Far-off Washington bureaucrats would. The FTC would be able to tell, say, a Kroger in Ohio the acceptable price it can charge for milk.""Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy (Jr) said Kamala Harris economy plan is partly good but the price control proposal is absurd. ""My take on VP Harris's economic plan: it actually has some good ideas -- help for first-time homebuyers, tax credit for parents of newborns. But the notion that you can control inflation by limiting ""corporate price-gouging"" is absurd. That isn't the cause of inflation. It is the printing of trillions of dollars that go toward military spending and corporate giveaways. When you print money and spend it in ways that don't increase productive capacity for goods and services, you will get inflation. That VP Harris (or her team) does not understand basic economics is troubling,"" Kennedy posted.","Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled her economic plan Friday. She promised tax cuts for the middle class, expand child tax credit, federal ban of price gouging. Trump campaign in response called Harris Comrade Kamala and said price controls exist in Soviet, Venezuela.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112576076,imgsize-1291321,width-400,resizemode-4/112576076.jpg"
