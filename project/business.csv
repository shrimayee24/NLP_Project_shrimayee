NEW DELHI: A couple arrested by ED from Punjab on Friday, who had masterminded a multi-level marketing fraud by duping investors with promises of handsome rental value on purchase of cloud space & leasing it back, has been remanded in ED custody.On Saturday, a special PMLA court in Jalandhar remanded Sukhvinder Singh Kharour to 10 days and Dimple Kharour to five days in ED custody. They allegedly collected over Rs 3,500 crore in past 2-3 years and siphoned off the ""proceeds of crime"".Look out notices were issued after they went underground. At least 26 luxury cars worth Rs 80 crore (belonging to the couple) were seized by ED last month. ED also attached other assets in Punjab, totalling Rs 178 crore.""The cloud sale and lease back model was found non-existent to cheat the investors. The proceeds of crime of Rs 3,558 crore (ascertained so far) generated out of criminal activities were diverted by VMSL (Vuenow Marketing Services Ltd) and group companies in giving commission to channel partners, purchase of various luxurious vehicles, gold and diamonds, routing of hundreds of crores through shell entities and further investment in properties,"" ED said.The accused created multiple shell entities to siphon off proceeds of crime. Huge funds were also diverted into bank accounts of Dimple and to film production units controlled by her, such as Kharour Films LLP, Fruitchaat Entertainment Pvt and Avni ITInfra Ventures Ltd, in which she is a director. However, these companies do not have any relation with the cloud particle business VMSL that collected huge funds from investors, the agency said.ED was on the lookout for the influential couple who had evaded arrest in Punjab for a long time despite several complaints of cheating and fraud. The central agency finally registered an FIR in Noida and with the help of UP Police issued a look out notice. Officials coordinated with international enforcement agencies that helped in tracing the accused in Nepal from where they were sent to India. ""Sukhvinder, CEO and founder of Vuenow Group is 'mastermind' of the scam who in connivance with his close aides orchestrated the 'Cloud Particle Scam',"" ED said.","Sukhvinder and Dimple Kharour masterminded multi-level marketing fraud.

For 21 days, voices of Kerala's ASHA workers have echoed outside state secretariat -26,140 women demanding three months' unpaid wages and a raise from their paltry Rs 7,000 monthly honorarium. ""Every payment comes after a strike,"" said S Mini, vice president of Kerala ASHA Health Workers' Association. ""Sometimes, we wait eight months.""Their struggle is met not with sympathy but with delays and excuses. Yet, the working class stands with them. Auto-rickshaw drivers ferry them for free, voluntary groups provide food and water - support born from shared hardship.Govt says it cannot raise ASHA wages, pleading financial distress. Though it professes empty coffers, it has found the means to more than double the salaries of Kerala's public service commission members. The chairman's salary has recently surged from Rs 76,450 to Rs 224,100 and members will now receive Rs 219,000 - up from Rs 70,290. Their rent and travel allowances have ballooned as well. The contrast is stark. ASHA workers - backbone of Kerala's public health system - must fight for survival, while bureaucrats see their fortunes swell.

"State polls set to pit INDIA allies against each other, hit unity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/state-polls-set-to-pit-india-allies-against-each-other-hit-unity/articleshow/118668358.cms,"Congress sources said while there is no view against an INDIA bloc meeting, there is no agenda at hand to hold one either

NEW DELHI: Amid growing concerns over unity of opposition INDIA bloc in the wake of BJP's political victories, a push from a section that it should revive its sense of purpose as during 2024 Lok Sabha elections is meeting with strong roadblocks. The main hurdle in getting the alliance together to convey a joint resolve is said to be the coming elections which will see INDIA bloc parties take on each other as rivals. Congress sources said while there is no view against an INDIA bloc meeting, there is no agenda at hand to hold one either, while coordination between the allies in Parliament is going well, as witnessed during the last two sessions. ""If any immediate agenda crops up, there can be a get together, but presently there is none,"" sources said.However, sources in non-Congress alliance parties said three elections lined up in 2026 and 2027, for which preparations have started, are creating complications, and political dissonance among allies will only get shriller with time. ""They have made the situation complex for greater show of unity and purpose,"" an INDIA bloc member said.Assembly elections in Bengal are scheduled for early 2026, followed by those in Kerala in mid-2026, and in Punjab in early 2027. If an alliance does not fructify between TMC and Congress in Bengal, the state battle will have three allies, including Left, fighting against each other. It was Congress and Left which contested as a marginal bloc against TMC in 2021, while TMC and BJP slugged it out as the main players.Besides, Congress and AAP will be main opponents in AAP-governed Punjab, continuing the face-off between the two in the Delhi elections in Feb, which BJP won. Then, Congress and Left will be the main rivals in Left-ruled Kerala.While Congress, CPM-led Left and TMC faced-off against each other in Lok Sabha polls too, AAP had tied up with Congress. Many believe holding a joint political show at this moment will undercut their posturing as fierce rivals on their home turfs. ""It is the reason why I feel it would be difficult to hold an INDIA meeting,"" an opposition member said.The opposition platform, cobbled ahead of Lok Sabha polls, came together seamlessly and ensured a state-wise seat-sharing formula that helped the allies challenge BJP and perform better than expected in the polarisation-propelled contest.But the bloc has since lost its unity, with allies sparring politically, and also fighting against each other in elections, as was the case in Haryana and Maharashtra polls. Renewed BJP upsurge has led to many opposition parties emphasising the need to bring about fresh cohesion in INDIA bloc.",There are growing concerns over unity of opposition INDIA bloc in the wake of BJP's political victories.

NEW DELHI: In a significant blow to international drug cartels , Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) secured convictions in a dozen cases across country in first two months of the year.The convictions have resulted in 29 hardcore drug traffickers being found guilty, Union home minister Amit Shah said Sunday.In a post on X, Shah said, ""Modi government is unsparing in punishing drug traffickers who drag our youth into the dark abyss of addiction for the greed of money. As a result of a foolproof investigation with a bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom strategy, 29 drug traffickers have been convicted by the court in 12 different cases across India. We pledge to continue combating the drug menace with ruthless and meticulous investigations to build a drug-free Bharat.""The convictions happened in Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Dehradun, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Kolkata and Lucknow between Jan and Feb.Convictions under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act are challenging to secure due to stringent requirements of proof and need to establish culpability beyond reasonable doubt. "" NDPS Act mandates that prosecution prove the accused's guilt through credible search and seizures besides clear links, which can be difficult to obtain, especially in cases where the accused may have taken steps to conceal their involvement,"" an officer said. Further, the Act's emphasis on need for corroborative evidence, such as witness testimony or forensic analysis, makes it harder to secure convictions.The cases where convictions happened involved seizure of narcotics, including charas, ganja, heroin and opium. The convicted individuals were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment ranging from one to 15 years, along with fines.According to NCB, in Ahmedabad, three individuals were convicted and sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1 lakh each for possessing 23.8kg charas. In Bhopal, four individuals were convicted and sentenced to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2 lakh each for trafficking 123kg ganja.In Chandigarh, two individuals were convicted and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10,000 each for attempting to transport 438g opium to Canada. A Zimbabwean national was convicted and sentenced to 11 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3 lakh for possessing 2.9kg heroin in Kochi.","Convictions have resulted in 29 hardcore drug traffickers being found guilty.

AHMEDABAD: AC Patel from Gujarat had become Mohammad Najir Hussain of Pakistan - but only for a moment. And in that moment, he had belonged nowhere at all.Patel's passport bore Hussain's name and nationality, but American authorities saw through the deception. The man who claimed to be Hussain was unmasked. Patel arrived at Delhi airport on February 12 via flight AA-292 after US authorities sent him back to India.American agencies have intensified their crackdown on undocumented Indians following Donald Trump's new term since January, targeting immigrants living illegally in US and deporting them home. In the past month alone, three flights packed with Indian deportees - including 74 Gujaratis - have landed in India after being expelled by US authorities.Patel's real troubles had only just begun. Delhi police arrested him on arrival. He faces multiple serious charges, including cheating by impersonation, and misuse of passport. What stunned Indian immigration officials was the Pakistani passport. Not just any forged document, but an actual lost passport that belonged to Hussain.Cornered, Patel confessed. He had paid an agent in Dubai to forge his identity, swapping his Gujarat roots for a Pakistani character, just to secure a spot on a flight to US.Patel's real passport had expired in 2016 and instead of renewing it, he relied on human traffickers who provided him with fraudulent documents and facilitated his illegal journey via Dubai.""Human smugglers pick passports that are strong for getting a US visa or randomly assign some UAE citizen's passport to sneak into US,"" a source said.","AC Patel, whose real passport had expired in 2016, was arrested on arrival in Delhi for misuse of passport and cheating by impersonation.

MUMBAI: A special Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) court in Mumbai on Saturday directed the agency to file a first information report (FIR) against former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Madhabi Puri Buch and five other public service officials, including three current whole time members of Sebi and two officials of the BSE.The order is for a probe into alleged irregularities in granting listing permission to a company on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in 1994 and alleged failure to exercise regulatory oversight . The complainant invoked various IPC offences and the Prevention of Corruption Act for suspected offences of criminal misconduct by public servants and illegal gratification.The February 1 order by Special Judge S E Bangar said, “There is prima facie evidence of regulatory lapses and collusion, requiring a fair and impartial probe.”Sebi, in a statement on Sunday, said it would be initiating appropriate legal steps to challenge this order and remains committed to ensuring due regulatory compliance in all matters.The court order was in response to a private complaint filed by one Sapan Shrivastava . He said he is a media person and was seeking directions for the registration of an FIR and probe against Buch, 60, and others. The others include Ashwani Bhatia, Ananth Narayan, Kamlesh Varshney—all three whole time members of Sebi, and Pramd Agarwal, Chairman and Public Interest Director (BSE), and Sundararaman Ramamurthy, MD and CEO, BSE.The court said it would monitor the investigation.On Sunday, Sebi also stated, “Even though these officials were not holding their respective positions at the relevant point of time, the court allowed the application without issuing any notice or granting any opportunity to Sebi to place the facts on record.”The application before the court sought probe into “alleged offences committed by the proposed accused involving large-scale financial fraud, regulatory violations, and corruption.” The court noted that the allegations pertain to the fraudulent listing of a company on the stock exchange with the active connivance of regulatory authorities, particularly Sebi, without compliance under the Sebi Act, 1992, and rules and regulations thereunder.The complainant alleged that Sebi officials failed in their statutory duty, facilitated market manipulation, and enabled corporate fraud by allowing the listing of a company that did not meet the prescribed norms.Shrivastava, a Dombivali resident, arguing in person, said despite approaching the police station and regulatory bodies “on multiple occasions no action has been taken, necessitating judicial intervention under Section 156(3) CrPC (criminal procedure code).” The section empowers the court to direct police to take action if a cognizable offence is made out.The order noted that the “allegations disclose a cognizable offence, necessitating an investigation.”The court said the complaint alleged “procedural lapses and noncompliance in the IPO process, leading to an irregular listing of the company” and cited documents, also “placed on record,” “Regulatory filings and stock market reports indicating artificial inflation of share prices and market manipulation.”The special court analysed the law and referred to the Supreme Court ruling of 2015, which set out that a private application must be supported by an affidavit ensuring due diligence and the “Magistrate must be satisfied that a prima facie case exists before directing an investigation.” The court, on reviewing the material before it, also observed that the “inaction by law enforcement and Sebi necessitates judicial intervention.”The Judge said, “Considering the gravity of allegations, applicable laws, and settled legal precedents, this court deems it appropriate to direct an investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC.”The court said thus, “The concerned Anti Corruption Bureau, Worli, Mumbai Region, Mumbai is directed to register an FIR under the relevant provisions of IPC, Prevention of Corruption Act, Sebi Act, and other applicable laws.”The BSE in a statement on Sunday evening said it is initiating necessary and appropriate legal steps after seeing the special court order.The statement issued by BSE said the company mentioned in the order is ""Cals Refineries Ltd.'' listed in 1994 when officials named in the plea were ""not in their respective positions...and were not connected with the company at all.'' BSE said, ""The application is frivolous and vexatious.''Like Sebi, BSE too said no notice was issued to it nor was it given an opportunity to place facts on record.It said, ""BSE is initiating necessary and appropriate legal steps in this regard. As a responsible market institution, BSE remains committed to upholding regulatory compliance and ensuring transparency''",A special Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) court in Mumbai on Saturday directed the agency to file a first information report (FIR) against former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Madhabi Puri Buch.

It is because of his organisational efforts that 75-80 of us were newly elected. He is essential for the party, and we are confident that the high command will make him CM,"" he added.The MLA assured that Shivakumar's elevation to CM would occur through Congress' own strength. ""It is our right. We will demand it, and the high command will recognise his efforts,"" he maintained.After Congress' victory in May 2023 Assembly elections, Siddaramaiah secured the CM position while Shivakumar accepted the deputy chief minister role, following intense competition between them.Although reports indicated a ""rotational chief minister"" arrangement where Shivakumar would take over after two-and-a-half years, the party has not officially confirmed this agreement.Shivaganga requested the high command to control cooperation minister K N Rajanna's public criticism of Shivakumar. ""He is causing embarrassment to the party and the government.

Private medical colleges are saving crores of rupees by either not paying stipends to MBBS interns and resident doctors or paying them a fraction of what government medical colleges pay. According to the National Medical Commission (NMC), the data on stipend payment submitted by colleges showed that 60 (33 govt colleges and 27 private ones) were not paying MBBS interns any stipend.Most private colleges have not even submitted the information on how much stipend is being paid. After initially threatening to take action, in the face of colleges not even submitting data sought from them, the apex regulator, the NMC, has passed the buck to state authorities.Thousands of MBBS students doing clinical duties during the final year internship are being paid less than the national floor minimum wage of Rs 5,300 per month according to the data submitted to Supreme Court by NMC. Data from 20 private colleges shows that they pay Rs 5,000 or less. Many colleges have admitted that they do not pay any stipend. Though this information was available to NMC in July last year, no action has been taken against any college.The NMC’s PG Medical Education Regulation 2023 stipulate that private colleges have to pay a stipend equivalent to what government colleges of the state pay resident doctors. However, the NMC (Compulsory Rotating Medical Internship) Regulations, 2021 are vague about how much MBBS interns should be paid. They state that ""all interns shall be paid stipend as fixed by the appropriate authority applicable to the institution/University or State"". Taking advantage of this, many private colleges pay MBBS interns a pittance.“I had alerted the health ministry to the vague wording in the clause regarding stipend for MBBS interns in 2022, when the draft was put up for comments from the public, and later raised objections when the suggestion was not incorporated. I had requested them to amend the clause to make it mandatory for all colleges to pay stipend at par with government medical colleges of the particular state. Neither the health ministry nor the NMC has done anything about it,” said Dr KV Babu, an RTI activist who has been pursuing the issue over five years.The stipend paid by some private colleges is as low as Rs 2,000 per month though they take several lakhs as fees per year. For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, government colleges pay MBBS interns Rs 22,500 per month. However, many private colleges are paying just Rs 2,000-5,000 as stipend per month. The tuition fee alone for the MBBS course in these private colleges is Rs 65 lakh for management quota students and over Rs 1.2 crore for NRI quota students. Most of these colleges with about 150 seats each would have had to spend roughly Rs 4 crore per year if they paid stipend equal to what government colleges are paying. By paying the interns a pittance, a college could save over Rs 2 crore or more each year, even as they collect around Rs 50 crore just from tuition fees.Similarly, in Karnataka, MBBS interns in state government colleges are paid a stipend of Rs 30,000 per month. But many private colleges are paying just Rs 10,000-12,000, while their annual tuition fees for management and NRI seats could be as much as Rs 25 lakh to Rs 45 lakh per year. In Pondicherry, while government colleges pay Rs 20,000 as stipend, a deemed university medical college with 250 seats, where annual tuition fees are Rs 25 lakh, pays just Rs 5,000. The college earns over 1.2 crore from each MBBS student, but spends less than one lakh rupees on stipend for each student.There is wide variation even in the stipend paid in government colleges from about Rs 35,000 in Assam to just Rs 12,000 in Uttar Pradesh. This is despite a long-standing demand of MBBS students for the amount to be centrally fixed and made mandatory for all colleges whether government or private. NMC was not even acting on the issue of non-payment of stipend till the Supreme Court categorically stated that paying stipend was mandatory. The case drags on as NMC claims to be struggling to get data from medical colleges. Instead of asking colleges, which are under its direct control, the NMC has been writing innumerable letters to the directorate of medical education of various states asking them to submit the data from all colleges on payment of stipend.NA- not applicable since the state may not have a private college, or a govt college in the case of SikkimNo info- the information has not been submitted by the state/college*only one college has given data and the amount is wrong since Haryana revised the stipend to Rs 17,000 in 2018 and last year it was revised again to Rs 24,310.States which had not submitted any information included Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Manipur, Nagaland, and the union territories of Chandigarh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The stipend in govt colleges in Rajasthan is Rs 14,000, in Jharkhand it is Rs 17,000, Rs 15,900 in Chhattisgarh and almost Rs 14,000 in Madhya Pradesh.Source: Affidavit filed by the NMC in court in July 2024","Private medical colleges are saving crores of rupees by either not paying stipends to MBBS interns and resident doctors or paying them a fraction of what government medical colleges pay.

MUMBAI: A special court here has directed the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to register an FIR against former Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and five other officials in connection with alleged stock market fraud and regulatory violations . ""There is prima facie evidence of regulatory lapses and collusion, requiring a fair and impartial probe,"" the special ACB court judge, Shashikant Eknathrao Bangar, said in the order passed on Saturday.The court said it will monitor the probe, and sought a status report (of the case) within 30 days.The court order also noted that the allegations disclose a cognisable offence, necessitating an investigation.The inaction by law enforcement (agencies) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) necessitates judicial intervention under the provisions of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code), it added.The complainant, a media reporter, had sought an investigation into the alleged offences committed by the proposed accused, involving largescale financial fraud , regulatory violations and corruption.The allegations pertain to the fraudulent listing of a company on the stock exchange with the active connivance of regulatory authorities, particularly the Sebi, without compliance under the SEBI Act, 1992 and rules and regulations thereunder.The complainant claimed that the SEBI officials failed in their statutory duty, facilitated market manipulation, and enabled corporate fraud by allowing the listing of a company that did not meet the prescribed norms.Despite approaching the police station and regulatory bodies concerned on multiple occasions, no action has been taken by them, the complainant said.The court, after considering the material on record, directed the ACB Worli, Mumbai Region, to register an FIR under relevant provisions of the IPC, Prevention of Corruption Act, SEBI Act, and other applicable laws.India's first woman Sebi chief Buch, who faced conflict of interest allegations by the US-based short-seller Hindenburg and also political heat thereafter, completed her three-year tenure on Friday.Although, Buch in her tenure made significant strides in areas like faster settlements in equities, enhanced FPI disclosures and increasing mutual fund penetration through Rs 250 SIP, the last year of her tenure saw heightened controversy, when she battled a series of allegations by Hindenburg and the Congress party, while simultaneously dealing with in-house employee protests against ""toxic work culture"".In August last year, Buch faced pressure to resign after the Hindenburg Research accused her of having conflict of interest that prevented a thorough examination of manipulation and fraud claims at the Adani Group.Hindenburg accused Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch of investing in offshore entities that were allegedly part of a fund structure in which Vinod Adani -- the elder brother of Adani group founder chairman Gautam Adani -- also had investments.Buchs have denied the allegation, saying the investments were made before she joined the regulator and she had complied with all disclosure requirements.Hindenburg recently announced shutting down its business.",A special court here has directed the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to register an FIR against former Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and five other officials.

DEHRADUN: There was no time to run. One moment, the workers were asleep inside their container homes, the bitter cold pressing in from all sides, the hum of the mountains steady and unbroken.

And before anyone could move, the avalanche was there, like a sudden apparition in a horror movie.Ganesh Kumar, a road construction worker from Pithoragarh, barely had time to open his eyes before the container was ripped from its place it was pegged and sent tumbling into the snow.

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar has warned over ""inorganic demographic variations "" in the country claiming that there was ""intent to increase"" the population to ""secure prowess"". In an apparent attack on a particular community, Dhankhar added that there was an attempt of ""orchestrated, financially backed misadventures aimed at effecting conversions"".Making a strong appeal for unity, the vice president cautioned against engaging ""in polarised, divisive activities"" saying, ""In this country that takes pride in its Sanatan values of inclusivity, where diversity is reflected in unity, we cannot afford to be distanced from these core values and engage in polarised, divisive activities. Time for us to fall in the groove of Sanatan Dharma, as enlightened by Shri P Parameswaran Ji."" Dhankhar, however, did not specify what those ""divisive activities"" were.He further flagged demographic concerns claiming a conspiracy of ""inorganic demographic variations"", calling out to ""preserve the pristine demographic sanctity of Bharat.""""Demography does matter. Demography should not be confused with majoritarianism. We cannot have a society divided into these two camps. The nation is faced with grim challenges when it comes to demography. The demography evolution must be organic, natural, soothing,"" he said.""Only then it reflects unity in diversity. However, if demographic variations are brought about in the nature of virtual earthquake, there is cause for concern. If inorganic demographic variations take place with the intent to increase demographic components with the object to secure prowess, then we have to be alarmed. This is noticeably being done. We are at a crossroads where we can neither overlook nor countenance this highly destabilising development. We have to be extremely alert. All have to converge to preserve the pristine demographic sanctity of Bharat,"" he added.Dhankhar, however, cited no evidence to prove the claim, as India is yet to conduct census to count its people. Meanwhile, the last census data contradicts VP's claims and reveals that while India’s Muslim population grew at a faster rate than the Hindu population between 1991-2001 and 2001-2011, the pace of growth declined more significantly for Muslims than for Hindus over these decades. Among all major religious communities, Hindus saw the smallest decline in population growth, whereas smaller groups like Jains and Buddhists experienced the steepest drops.Dhankhar warned that the influx of illegal migrants poses a threat to the nation and called for resolute action to prevent ""demographic dislocations.""""How can a nation suffer millions of illegal migrants? Look at their number. Look at the danger they bring to this country. I would urge that we must courageously thwart these demographic dislocations. They make demands on our employment, on our health, on our education sectors, and then become a factor in electoral politics. The unchecked flow is also threatening our culture.

Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson reveal their career plans after their departure from Fox Sports following Super Bowl LIX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/erin-andrews-and-charissa-thompson-reveal-their-career-plans-after-their-departure-from-fox-sports-following-super-bowl-lix/articleshow/118657265.cms,"Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson, both ex-FOX Sports reporters, are contemplating post-retirement plans after their contracts expired post-Super Bowl LIX. They look forward to more laid-back roles in local news, aiming for better work-life balance and even possible returns to major networks.

Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson share their post-retirement plans



Erin Andrews, a 46-year-old FOX reporter, has expressed her hope for the future after her contract ended after Super Bowl LIX . Andrews, who joined FOX from ESPN in 2012, is not the only FOX reporter facing an uncertain future during the offseason. Her podcast co-host, Charissa Thompson, is also out of contract. Andrews has been considering reaching an agreement with FOX for a year.Since leaving Fox Sports after Super Bowl LIX, Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson have been sharing their post-retirement plans. Their contracts expiring after the February 9 game when the Eagles thrashed the Chiefs, the two sportscasters are now in talks regarding what to do next.Although they are still keeping their near-term undertakings in the offing, they have shared hints regarding their vision of the long-term future as well as plans after retirement and exiting the business of sports broadcasting.""Erin and I also have an affinity for local news,"" Thompson said on the Calm Down Podcast. ""There's going to be a time in our lives. ""I hope it's a retirement community in Florida or somewhere where they can roll us out and we can work like a couple days a week, and The Morning News can or anytime like the Evening News can you imagine?""Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson seem to be taking things slow and easy after leaving behind the frenetic and frequently frantic atmosphere of Fox Sports. Instead of reporting international news and major sporting events, the renowned broadcasters are now keen to move in the direction of more local-based work so that they can remain engaged with their interests without constantly having to respond to national media pressures.For Erin Andrews, 46, there is one top priority as she begins planning her next act—steering clear of early morning drudgery. She wants to organize her days so that she can have a better-balanced existence, with more time with her family before diving into new ventures. This focus shift is part of her wish to balance personal health along with continued engagement in projects of value.With her Fox Sports stint now behind her, Erin Andrews may pursue opportunities with big networks like NBC, ESPN, or NFL Network—provided that they are willing to meet her former $2 million salary.While she enjoys the possibility of having a more laid-back career, Andrews has not eliminated the possibility of a shocking comeback to Fox. Having worked for the network between 2012 and 2025 and becoming lead sideline reporter, she is always available for a possible return to the company.“I really hope I'm still employed by FOX when FOX gets a Vegas Super Bowl,"" Andrews added. ""This is epic, it's Tuesday, it's nutty, I wish the weather was better, but this is crazy. I just did a panel, and they were serving me like bloody Marys. The people were drinking at 9 a.m. when I was on the panel.

Sidney Crosby trade talk: Brian Hayes suggests summer move over deadline deal

Could Crosby have a change of heart before the trade deadline?

Speculation is growing about Sidney Crosby possibly leaving the Penguins to join the Avalanche and reunite with Nathan MacKinnon . TSN analysts Carlo Colaiacovo and Bryan Hayes fueled the discussion after Crosby played alongside MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.During a TSN Hockey segment, analyst Carlo Colaiacovo asked insider Bryan Hayes whether Sidney Crosby might reconsider his future with the Pittsburgh Penguins after playing alongside Nathan MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both former No. 1 picks from Nova Scotia, share a close bond and have showcased strong on-ice chemistry. While Crosby has been a lifelong Penguin, speculation grows about whether he might one day reunite with MacKinnon in the NHL.""I'm, I'm not sure it happens before the trade deadline,"" Hayes said on TSN's OverDrive. ""It feels like an off season move, or sit right like now, if he's gonna eventually conclude.""Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both from Nova Scotia, have a well-known friendship, and their on-ice chemistry has often led to speculation about a potential team-up in the NHL.Nathan MacKinnon recently secured his long-term future with the Avalanche by signing an eight-year, $100.8 million contract, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league. With a strong core that includes defenseman Cale Makar, the Avalanche are considered top Stanley Cup contenders, and adding Crosby would only increase their chances of success.Talking about winning with Nathan MacKinnon in the 4 Nations Face-Off, Hayes mentioned that if Crosby contemplates a trade, he would prefer it to be handled discreetly and swiftly.""That's the thing. And... if you're gonna get to that conclusion, do it as quickly as you can,"" Hayes said. ""Yes, like, if it's in the back of your mind that you kind of realize, all right, I don't think I can finish this dance. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. And that's likely what's gonna happen in Pittsburgh.""Also Read: NHL Score: Nathan MacKinnon led the Avalanche past Devils in a 5-1 win with two goals While the thought of Sidney Crosby teaming up with Nathan MacKinnon in Colorado is exciting, his deep commitment to the Penguins makes a trade seem unlikely.

Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from Gisele Bündchen

Tom Brady is making a big transition in his life as he gets set to sell his $150 million Miami estate, a home where he previously lived with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. Sources indicate that the sale comes from the emotional pain of watching Bündchen progress with her new life and her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, and their newborn baby. While Brady has kept his eye on his post-NFL business, the fact that his ex-wife is moving on to a new chapter has reportedly not been easy for him.Sources indicate that 47-year-old ex-New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance between himself and the lingering reminders of his past. While he continues with his work and self-development, the harsh fact of remaining unmarried for close to three years with his former spouse, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, having reestablished life with her lover, Joaquim Valente, has purportedly been challenging. Unloading his $150 million Miami villa seems a part of wrapping that chapter up and opening doors to a new life.Brady and Bündchen, who share their two children, divorced after 13 years of marriage in 2022. Although they remain on good terms for the benefit of their family, the fact that their homes are in close proximity has not allowed Brady to completely move on.The supermodel and her new beau, a jiu-jitsu instructor, now share a lavish waterfront home just across from Brady's compound—a home that was originally part of the ex-couple's future together. Far from representing their aspirations, however, it now serves as a bitter reminder of what he stands to lose.For Brady, the sale of the mansion can be more than a money matter, but a heart matter as well. Leaving a city full of reminders of his own marriage may grant him the time he requires to work on being happy himself and potentially even opening himself to finding another relationship.Though he still hasn't commented publicly on his motivation for selling, those in his inner circle say the switch is about something greater than a piece of property—it's about reclaiming his sense of mind and looking to the future stage of his life.""Every time he looks out across the water,"" an insider told radaronline.com. ""He sees Gisele's refurbished home and perfect life with her martial arts hunk and their new baby, and it gets him down. He can't take it anymore. He wants to sell the house. It reminds him of Gisele. She was the one who dominated the remodeling, and it's her style, her personal touches. He still feels her nuance everywhere.”Also Read: “I’m pretty disappointed”: Rob Gronkowski feels overlooked as Tom Brady makes Raiders moves without considering him Tom Brady has no plans to leave Miami, the city he moved to in 2019 when he joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, he is looking to downsize and find a more private residence that allows him to step away from the memories tied to his current home.Despite wanting a fresh start, Brady remains dedicated to co-parenting his two children, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12, with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. His goal is to create a peaceful and comfortable environment where he can focus on his personal well-being while staying actively involved in his children's lives.","Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from Gisele Bündchen.

Fare hike effect: 13% drop in daily ridership on Namma Metro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fare-hike-effect-13-drop-in-daily-ridership-on-namma-metro/articleshow/118672856.cms,"BENGALURU: Average daily ridership on Namma Metro has seen a 13% drop since fares were revised in the second week of Feb. While the average daily ridership for the month preceding Feb 9, when the fare hike was effected, was nearly 8.2 lakh, the next 20 days saw the number falling to nearly 7.1 lakh - a drop of 13%.Month on month, Feb witnessed a 20% drop in ridership. While 2.5 crore passengers travelled on Metro in Jan, Feb saw the number nosedive to 2 crore, according to data from Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation.While BMRCL claimed the average rate hike was 46%, passengers alleged that on some sections, the increase was up to 110%. Following public outrage, the hike was moderated in fares in some stages, where fares increased by up to 110%, the management decided to revisit the fare matrix. Shortdistance travel was provided some relief, but long-distance passengers alleged the rejigging of the fare matrix did not help them.After the fare revision, the base fare of Namma Metro was fixed at Rs 10, and the maximum Rs 90. Despite restructuring of fare matrices, the ridership is still southbound. The lowest ridership of slightly over 4.9 lakh was recorded on Feb 23. After the hike, the daily ridership crossed the 8-lakh mark only twice — on Feb 10 and 24. The fare hike has forced thousands of passengers to use their private vehicles or city buses. Students and lowerincome groups using the Metro were hit badly. Asked about what measures BMRCL has taken to im prove the ridership, its MD Maheshwar Rao said, “We are analyzing the data and impact on ridership.” Replying to a question whether the BMRCL will revisit the metro fare hike, the official said, “I’ve no comments.”Passengers are questioning why both central and state govts are buying time to address the grievances of those affected by fare hikes. Subramanya B, a regular commuter, said, “The primary objective of the Metro was to decongest the city by making it affordable travel. But govts are going against the interest of people.”When other Metros are issuing concessional passes for students, BMRCL charges students on a par with other passengers. Anupama, a student, said, “Students are not in a position to pay Rs 3,500 a month for travel in Namma Metro. This has resulted in a burden on parents.”","Average daily ridership on Namma Metro has seen a 13% drop since fares were revised in the second week of Feb.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
