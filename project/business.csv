"Gujarat, Maharashtra, UP lead rooftop solar figures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-maharashtra-up-lead-rooftop-solar-figures/articleshow/128403876.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as frontrunners in rooftop solar installations, even as over 23 lakh rooftop solar systems (RTS) were installed across the country in the last two years under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana.Launched on Feb 13, 2024, with a financial outlay of ₹75,021 crore, the scheme aims to install RTS in one crore households by March 2027. The Centre provides a one-time financial assistance of up to ₹78,000 per household, while several states offer additional subsidies.According to the national portal, 23,68,383 systems with an aggregate capacity of about 8,691 MW have been installed till Feb 13 this year. The govt has released ₹16,932.4 crore in subsidies.Under the scheme, a 3-kW solar plant can generate about 300 units of electricity per month — enough to reduce the bill to zero if consumption stays within that limit. More than 12.5 lakh consumers have received zero electricity bills in at least one month since the launch.The number of installations is estimated to be close to three million when state-level subsidy programmes are included.Gujarat leads with nearly 5.6 lakh installations, followed by Maharashtra (4.5 lakh), Uttar Pradesh (3.7 lakh) and Kerala (1.9 lakh).Adoption remains low in the Northeast: Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura together account for only 4,174 installations. Delhi, Goa, West Bengal and Chandigarh also have recorded modest numbers, with 6,209, 1,721, 1,265 and 1,050 installations, respectively.The govt acknowledged that nearly three-fourths of installations are concentrated in 10-11 states. Many states are yet to notify virtual net-metering guidelines, which allow consumers to feed surplus power into the grid and receive payment.“This is a model with a customer-first approach and has become immensely popular. People see rooftop solar at their neighbours’ homes and get inspired. We want adoption across all states and are holding regular meetings with state govts,” said JVN Subramanyam, joint secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.He added the scheme has seen rapid growth: monthly installations have risen from about 15,000 at launch to over two lakh and continue to grow.Industry players, however, flagged financing challenges. Installing a rooftop solar system requires an upfront investment of ₹2–2.5 lakh, leading many consumers to seek loans. “Financing is currently the weakest part of the ecosystem. The process is slow, requires branch visits and approvals can take two to five weeks,” said Shreya Mishra, co-founder & CEO, SolarSquare.She added that generation can vary by 20–30% annually depending on installation quality and maintenance.Subramanyam said the govt is working with banks to simplify financing. “For maintenance, vendors provide a five-year warranty. We are also working with manufacturers to make systems more reliable and consumer-friendly. More than 1.25 lakh people have been trained in solar technologies, and we expect a maintenance ecosystem to develop soon,” he said.Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, CEO of National Solar Energy Federation of India, said awareness remains a key challenge. “While there is broad awareness about the scheme, understanding of the application process, system details and technical aspects is still limited,” he said.“Many organisations and civil society groups are working on the ground to spread awareness. We are at an inflection point where solar is close to becoming a commodity. Once that happens, the PM Surya Ghar target for 2027 could be exceeded,” Pulipaka added.","Gujarat leads with nearly 5.6 lakh installations, followed by Maharashtra (4.5 lakh), Uttar Pradesh (3.7 lakh) and Kerala (1.9 lakh).

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

Parliamentary approval process underway

Double contributions convention to be implemented in parallel

Tariff reductions and market access

The India-UK free trade agreement signed in July last year is expected to be implemented from April 2026, a government official said.India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025, under which 99 per cent of Indian exports will enter the British market at zero duty, while India will reduce tariffs on a range of British goods including cars and whisky.“We are expecting the pact to be implemented from April this year,” the official said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The agreement requires approval from the UK Parliament before it can take effect. In India, such trade agreements are cleared by the Union Cabinet.According to PTI, after ratification by the British Parliament, the pact will be implemented on a mutually agreed date. The House of Commons held a debate on the India-UK CETA earlier this week.Chris Bryant, minister of state in the UK Department for Business and Trade, responded during the debate on behalf of the Labour government, describing CETA as a significant achievement that goes “well beyond India's precedent in opening the door for UK businesses”.The British Parliament is currently ratifying the agreement, including debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, along with committee reviews, before implementation in the coming months.Alongside CETA, the two countries have signed a Double Contributions Convention (DCC) pact to prevent temporary workers from having to pay social security contributions in both countries.The official said both CETA and the DCC are likely to be implemented in parallel, as per PTI.CETA aims to double bilateral trade, currently estimated at $56 billion, between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies by 2030.Under the agreement, India will reduce import duties on Scotch whisky from 150 per cent to 75 per cent immediately, with a further reduction to 40 per cent by 2035.Also read| India-UK trade deal: From 99% duty-free access to benefits for Indian professionals - Here’s the FTA in 10 big numbers Import duties on automobiles will be cut to 10 per cent over five years from the current levels of up to 110 per cent, under a quota-based liberalisation system.In return, Indian exporters are set to gain improved access to the UK market for goods such as textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, sports goods and toys.India has also agreed to lower tariffs on British consumer products including chocolates, biscuits and cosmetics.During his visit to India in 2025, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed the desire for the agreement to be implemented as soon as “humanly possible.”Speaking in Mumbai in October last year, Starmer described the trade deal as Britain’s largest post-Brexit trade achievement and said he had instructed his team to ensure it is executed “as quickly as humanly possible”.Also read| India-UK trade deal: Starmer wants FTA implementation as soon as 'humanly possible'! The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to London in July 2025.Economists estimate the pact could increase trade between the two countries by about £25.5 billion ($34 billion) by 2040, with UK officials describing that figure as a starting point for further growth.If implemented as expected in April 2026, the agreement would mark a significant step in expanding bilateral economic ties and reducing tariff barriers across key sectors.","India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25.

Combat Proven SCALP Missiles Push India, France Defence Ties Into Next Phase After Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: US commander of Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel J. Paparo, during his India visit on Sunday, “applauded the tactical execution” of the Indian military operations against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and said “there is always a lesson to learn from every conflict in the world”.He said the US-India defence relationship is on a “steeply upward trajectory”, even as he flagged concerns about increasing “coercion” and “aggression” in the Indo-Pacific region.In reply to a TOI query about his views on Op Sindoor, the US commander, who was interacting with a select group of journalists, said, “First of all, I have tremendous reverence for the terrible event (Pahalgam terror attack) that preceded the crisis. In my discussion with my partners, I applaud the tactical execution (of operations). We also sincerely applaud the restraint that was exhibited. We hope to work together to see that such a terrible event doesn't happen again. ” The Admiral also said that he has seen a deep commitment from the Indian military to learn lessons from this conflict.Asked what lessons the US took away from Op Sindoor which saw Chinese weapons being used by Pakistan, Admiral Paparo said, “Complex long-range weapons have complex long- range kill chains”.With the “combination of sensors, communication, propulsion, warheads, seekers in the 21st century, geography is no longer a commodity...”On China’s increasing military might, the Admiral, who is responsible for all US military operations in the region, said, “Deterrence is our highest duty. It is my job to think through the worst-case scenario and to be prepared for that. India shares some of those concerns in the Indo-Pacific, as the region is home to 60% of the world’s population, more than 60% of the world’s GDP and seven of the world’s largest militaries.“We deal with those concerns with the growing partnerships... mutually respectful, sovereign relationship between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy,” he said, adding both the US and India are committed to the principles of sovereignty, freedom of navigation and freedom of seas.“We applaud India as a great net contributor to the security of the Indian Ocean region,” he said. The two sides are also looking at boosting maritime security cooperation, including in the sphere of undersea domain awareness.With the impending MILAN exercise in mind, Admiral Paparo said, “It is great to see the deepening of Indo-US defence partnership, enshrined in the recent defence agreement signed in Kuala Lumpur (Oct 31, 2025) between US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh. A number of joint exercises like Yudh Abhyas in Alaska, MILAN, Malabar series, COPE India exercise and Tiger Triumph series and people-to-people contacts are strengthening the ties between India and the US. And we treasure this relationship.”About modern warfare strategies, the Admiral said, “Increasingly, the 21st century will be dominated by actors who master the information environment, that is, space, counter-space, electronic warfare, low observability and other technologies.”On the upcoming AI summit hosted by India, he said, “PM Modi’s visionary AI summit.

Faith Versus Access Debate Erupts As Char Dham Temples Kedarnath, Badrinath Weigh Ban On Non Hindus

The big picture: Growth almost identical to the world

A religion defined by geography

Growth driven by births, not conversions

Living mostly as a majority

Age structure and fertility patterns

The global future of Hinduism

There was once a phrase that economists used, sometimes flippantly and often unfairly, to describe India’s slow economic expansion in the decades after Independence. They called it the “Hindu rate of growth” — a shorthand for stagnation, caution and incremental change. The term has long since fallen out of favour in economic discourse. But in an unexpected way, it could be used to describe the actual Hindu growth of rate.According to the Pew Research Center’s global demographic study “How the Global Religious Landscape Changed From 2010 to 2020,” the actual Hindu rate of growth today turns out to be strikingly literal. The world’s Hindu population has been expanding almost exactly in line with the growth of humanity itself. Neither surging dramatically nor shrinking in relative terms, Hinduism’s demographic story is one of stability in a century defined by rapid religious change.New global religion data suggests that when it comes to population trends, Hindus today embody something remarkably close to that old metaphor. The global Hindu population is growing, steadily and predictably, almost exactly in step with the world itself.Neither surging dramatically like some faiths nor shrinking in relative terms like others, Hinduism’s demographic story is one of continuity rather than upheaval.Between 2010 and 2020, the global Hindu population rose from roughly 1.07 billion to about 1.2 billion — an increase of around 126 million people in just one decade. Yet their share of the world’s population remained nearly unchanged at about 15%.This reflects an almost perfect demographic alignment. During the same period, the world population itself grew by roughly 12%, and the Hindu population expanded at nearly the same pace.By contrast, other major religions experienced sharper shifts. Muslims increased their share of the global population, while Christians saw their proportion decline. Hindus stood out as the only major group whose global footprint remained essentially stable.One of the most striking numbers in global religious demographics is the degree of Hindu concentration. About 99% of Hindus live in the Asia-Pacific region. Even more remarkably, roughly 95% reside in just one country: India. Nepal accounts for most of the remaining share. This makes Hinduism the most geographically concentrated major religion in the world. India alone determines the demographic trajectory of nearly a billion people.Unlike Christianity or Islam, which are spread across continents and cultures, Hinduism remains overwhelmingly anchored to a single civilisational geography.Another key finding is that Hindu population change is driven overwhelmingly by natural increase rather than religious switching.Globally, conversion into or out of Hinduism occurs at relatively low levels compared with other religions. This means births minus deaths — not changes in religious identity — shape the long-term trajectory.In demographic terms, Hinduism is one of the least mobile religious identities. Most followers continue to identify with the religion in which they were raised.Few religions are as closely associated with majority status as Hinduism. About 97% of Hindus worldwide live in countries where they form the dominant religious group, primarily India and Nepal. This is the highest majority concentration among all major faiths. By comparison, Christians and Muslims are far more geographically dispersed, with large shares living as minorities in multiple regions.The age profile of Hindus closely mirrors India’s demographic structure. India’s median age is around 28 years, significantly younger than Europe’s median age of over 40. Because India is home to about 95% of Hindus, the global Hindu population also has a relatively youthful base.This youthful demographic momentum helps sustain population growth even as fertility rates decline. India’s total fertility rate has fallen dramatically over the past half century, yet its large young population continues to drive expansion.Looking ahead, the future of Hinduism will remain tightly linked to India’s demographic transition. As fertility rates continue to fall and the population gradually ages, growth will slow in relative terms, even though total numbers will continue to rise for decades. In that sense, the modern “Hindu rate of growth” no longer implies stagnation. It reflects something far more distinctive: a billion-strong religion growing steadily, predictably, and almost perfectly in step with the world itself. In an era of dramatic religious shifts, that kind of numerical stability is a story in its own right.","The world’s Hindu population has been expanding almost exactly in line with the growth of humanity itself.

Railways quietly upgrades network: 81% tracks ready for 110 kmph speed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-quietly-upgrades-network-81-tracks-ready-for-110-kmph-speed/articleshow/128395262.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The govt informed Parliament in the last sessionthat nearly 81% of railway tracks are ready to allow trains to run at speeds of over 110 kmph, a two-fold increase compared to 2014. One-fifth of the existing tracks allow trains to run at speeds of more than 130 kmph.This is significant since the increase in sectional speeds has happened across the railway network rather than being a limited, corridor-based upgrade. As per govt data, 84,888 km out of the little less than 1.1-lakh-km of railway network has been upgraded to support speeds of 110 kmph and above and 23,477 km of this is capable of train operations at 130 kmph and above.This systemic upgrade is allowing railways to introduce new-age Vande Bharat -- both chair car and sleeper trains -- and Amrit Bharat trains that can run at faster speeds.Experts said the upgrade of sectional speeds is also important considering that unlike countries such as China, Japan and France, which achieved higher speeds primarily through the laying of new, passenger-only high-speed rail lines, India has pursued a fundamentally different and more complex path.The Indian approach has focussed on upgrading existing tracks that carry mixed traffic -- passenger and freight — which is far more challenging than building segregated high-speed corridors, as it requires strengthening track geometry, signalling, electrification and safety systems without disrupting daily operations.Railway ministry officials said India’s strategy has seen large contiguous stretches of tracks being upgraded progressively from 110 kmph to 130 kmph and further to 160 kmph.“This creates a laddered speed ecosystem rather than a sharp division between ‘slow’ conventional lines and isolated high-speed routes. Such gradation allows trains, crew training and signalling systems to evolve organically, reducing transition risks,” said an official.The speed capability is also spread across all railway zones, including freight-intensive zones such as East Central Railway, South East Central Railway and South Central Railway. “This ensures national uniformity and avoids the creation of elite, passenger-centric corridors disconnected from the rest of the network,” the official said.Railways run some of the world’s longest freight trains, carry over 2.5 crore passengers daily, operate with heavy axle loads of 22.9–25 tonnes, and maintain long welded rails, full electrification and increasingly automated signalling—all on the same tracks. No other railway system has attempted speed upgrades under such constraints at a comparable scale, they added.",Nearly 81% of railway tracks are ready to allow trains to run at speeds of over 110 kmph.

“From Compassion To Combat, Operation Sindoor Reflects New India” Rajnath Singh

Trade deals part of global integration: PM

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday cited the global context to argue in favour of modernising India’s defence sector, while calling upon the private sector to step up its act and share the gains with workers and shareholders.“Since Day 1, our govt has been clear we will do whatever it takes to support our defence forces and strengthen them. Yes, this year’s allocation is a record high, but viewing it in isolation only provides a limited perspective...As technology reshapes the world, our armed forces must be equipped with the best of Indian innovation and industry. As a nation that is playing an increasingly important role in the world, we have a duty to modernise our defence sector in line with current realities,” PM Modi told PTI in an interview.The comments come in the backdrop of an increasingly-fragile world, which is undergoing a shift in the power equations with the US and China seeking to stamp their expansionist policies, while conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia have been going on with no immediate resolution in sight. India has to contend with hostilities in the neighbourhood with cyber technology adding to challenges.The PM referred to Operation Sindoor, which showed India’s familiarisation with the tech warfare.The entire nation is proud of the courage shown by our armed forces during Operation Sindoor. During the operation, one could see the benefits of the reforms we have undertaken in the last decade. Therefore, defence budgets, modernisation, etc, all these are parts of our continuous effort and need not be linked to any particular issue. Yes, the reality is that our nation has to be strong and be prepared at all times, and that is what we are doing,” PM Modi said.Asked about the recent trade agreements, the PM said that they have been part of India’s global integration with the world, which has picked pace in recent times. Asserting that the recent deals — from the UK to the EU — have been in the pipeline for years and will help Indian producers diversify their markets besides opening opportunities for service professionals.“These trade agreements are significant not merely because of tariff reductions but because of supply-chain integration and market access in advanced economies. They gradually liberalise manufacturing tariffs, deepen services integration and create new avenues for labour-intensive exports such as textiles, footwear, electronics and engineering goods. In that sense, they support structural transformation rather than simply boosting headline trade numbers. These FTAs also anchor domestic reform to external commitments. They widen export opportunities, reduce tariff disadvantages relative to competitors, and integrate Indian firms more deeply into global value chains,” the PM said. PM Modi also called on the private sector for a “decisive response” to the govt’s reforms, for which he redoubled his vow.“Indian firms must invest more aggressively in research and development, adopt frontier technologies, deepen supply-chain capabilities and compete on quality and productivity rather than on protected margins. Incentives and tariff preferences can catalyse growth, but durable competitiveness must rest on innovation, efficiency and scale. Equally, as productivity rises, the gains must be shared fairly between workers, shareholders and owner-managers. Sustainable growth requires social legitimacy. Rising real wages, skill upgrading, and stable employment reinforce domestic demand and social cohesion, which, in turn, support long-term investment,” he said.Asked about the Budget’s emphasis on women, PM said welfare of women guided every govt decision. “...it is a matter of national pride that our finance minister, Nirmala Ji has presented the Budget nine consecutive times, which is a record and a matter of pride in itself. Several women across India feel inspired by this,” he said.While listing out several initiatives in the Budget, the PM made special reference to the announcement related to hostels. “Many girls drop out not because of a lack of talent, but because commuting long distances to labs and late study hours are difficult. This intervention directly addresses that constraint.”Further, PM Modi said the steps related to training of Allied Health Professionals, which will benefit women. “Women have always been at the centre of caregiving, but this is largely in the informal sector. By training 1.5 lakh caregivers next year and expanding institutions for Allied Health Professionals, with a target of 1 lakh trained over 5 years, we are embarking on a large-scale effort to formalise care work. This does two things: it creates dignified, certified employment for women and simultaneously strengthens India’s healthcare capacity.”","Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited the global context to argue in favour of modernising India’s defence sector.

Congress calls PM Modi's interview 'scripted'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday outlined India’s reform priorities for the next decade, asserting that his government’s “Reform Express” has delivered systemic transformation and benefitted common citizens in a significant way.In an interview to PTI, PM Modi said that his top three reform priorities for the coming decade will be continued structural reforms, deeper innovation and further simplification of governance, as India moves towards the goal of a “Viksit Bharat”.Asserting that his government’s reform push has moved beyond incremental changes, PM Modi said, “Reform is the commitment of this government, something we have shown in letter and spirit. I am proud to say that we have moved from incremental adjustments to systemic transformation.”When asked to prioritise three economic reforms for the next decade, he said, “Our direction is clear, rather than limiting it to a fixed number.“First, we will continue structural reforms that improve competitiveness and productivity. Second, we will deepen innovation in technology, manufacturing and services. Third, we will simplify governance further so that citizens and businesses can operate with greater ease and trust,” he said.He said that India’s growth story is being shaped by fundamental changes in governance and economic policy. Highlighting the country’s digital transformation, PM Modi said, “India is a digital leader in the world made possible by fundamental reforms in how people transact via the UPI platform.”The prime minister also emphasised the role of data infrastructure in the coming years. “Data centres will be a massive job creator for our youth; we invite whole world’s data to reside in India,” he said.On infrastructure, PM Modi said that India is witnessing an unprecedented expansion. “India witnessing most expansive infra push in its history, built with future readiness in mind,” he told PTI, underlining that infrastructure development is being planned with long-term needs in focus.PM Modi also described productive capital expenditure as a hallmark of his government and said the latest Union Budget avoided short-term populism. Instead, it prioritised record capital outlays to create jobs and strengthen long-term growth.Also Read | 'Focus less on margins': PM Modi says private sector 'critical' for Viksit Bharat, offers strong advise - top quotes He said that India’s goods exports have repeatedly broken earlier records in recent years, reflecting improved competitiveness and global integration.“Our national character has revealed itself even in challenging times; we are bright growth spot in difficult global circumstances,” he said, pointing to India’s resilience amid global economic uncertainty.On trade policy, the prime minister said that India’s free trade agreements are aimed at expanding opportunities for small businesses.“Our FTAs designed to expand market access for MSMEs in textile, leather, chemicals, handicrafts, gems and other sectors,” he said.Looking ahead, PM Modi stressed that the next leap towards a developed India will depend heavily on private sector participation. “Next leap to Viksit Bharat will depend on bold investment by pvt sector in innovation, long-term capacity, global competitiveness,” he said.He also underlined the role of women in India’s development journey. “It is my conviction that women will play the most important role in creating Viksit Bharat,” he said.Framing the broader vision, PM Modi said that the current policy direction should be seen as laying the foundation for long-term national goals. The reforms and investments being undertaken now, he suggested, are meant to prepare India for sustained growth over the next quarter-century.The Congress party reacted sharply to PM Modi's interview calling it “carefully scripted and desperate PR exercise”. Party leader Jairam Ramesh in a post on X said that the interview was timed to divert attention from criticism over the Union Budget and the Opposition’s attack on the government in Parliament.“The PM knows that this year’s Budget has been a damp squib and shows every sign of intellectual exhaustion. Markets have reacted negatively and investors have been unimpressed. Hence, he feels the need to give an interview a fortnight after the Budget was presented and a few days after it was taken apart by the Opposition in Parliament.

He maintained that none of his government’s budgets were prepared with the attitude of creating a routine “bahi khata” document.Highlighting digital growth and infrastructure expansion, PM Modi said India is a global digital leader due to reforms in transactions through the UPI platform and added that data centres would be a massive job creator.He also said India is witnessing the most expansive infrastructure push in its history and emphasised that the government will do whatever it takes to support and modernise the defence forces.The prime minister criticised the previous UPA government’s record, saying that during its rule, talks would begin and then break down, with little real substance achieved despite long negotiations.He also said political stability and predictability have restored investor confidence in India and asserted that the welfare of women guides every decision taken by his government.",The Congress on Sunday reacted sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s interview with news agency PTI.

NEW DELHI: India will launch its first set of sovereign AI models, announce major national AI research programmes, expand shared computing facilities, and roll out AI labs across 500 universities at AI Impact Summit 2026.Earlier, electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had said home-grown models are ready for public use and will be unveiled at the summit. Trained on Indian datasets, the models are designed to handle the country's linguistic diversity and sector-specific challenges, ranging from governance and healthcare to science and industry.A key focus of the push is talent creation. Vaishnaw said industry-led AI labs, along with GPUs, models and standardised curriculum, will be introduced in 500 universities to build a large national talent pipeline. Students will get hands-on access to AI infrastructure and real-world use cases, helping bridge the gap between education and industry needs.The fourth AI Impact Summit will be the largest edition so far and the first to be hosted in the Global South. It is expected to see participation from over 100 countries, and of more than 100 global AI leaders at CEO and CXO level and over 500 experts. The summit aims at delivering at least 10 actionable outcomes, backed by over 500 pre-events held in India and abroad.Highlighting India's focus on industry-driven AI deployment, Vaishnaw said Indian IT firms have already built over 200 sector-focused AI models aimed at improving productivity and efficiency. On infrastructure, he said nearly $70 billion has already flowed into AI-related investments, with the figure expected to rise further. He also underlined India's energy readiness, noting that almost half of the country's power capacity now comes from green sources.With sovereign models, campus labs and clear roadmaps on safe and trusted AI, the summit marks India's strongest push yet to turn AI ambition into real-world impact.","The fourth AI Impact Summit will be the largest edition so far and the first to be hosted in the Global South.

NEW DELHI: Resuming his aggression against the India-US trade deal, Congress’s Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asked five “simple questions” that he said PM Narendra Modi must answer since “farmers deserve clarity” if “we are giving another country a long-term grip on India’s agricultural system”.Rahul asked if provisions in the interim trade deal, as mentioned in the joint statement, suggests that India will be importing pulses and grains that are not explicitly mentioned in the statement, and if India will be opening the hitherto shut door through which the US can in future put more and more items on the table for import by India. He asked what the fate will be of soya farmers in MP, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and other states of the country if India imports GM soya oil from the US, and if farmers will survive “another price shock”.He asked the PM to clarify what comprises “additional products” mentioned in the statement for reduction or elimination of tariffs. “Does it signal pressure to open up pulses and other sensitive crops to US imports over time?” the Congress MP asked. Referring to the proposed import of DDG, Rahul asked if feeding Indian cattle the distillers grain made of GM American corn will not “effectively integrate our dairy chain with the US agricultural system”.Rahul also urged the PM to clarify if removing “non tariff barriers” implies that India will be pushed to dilute its stand against GM crops, weaken procurement, or undermine MSP and bonuses in the future.","Rahul asked if provisions in the interim trade deal suggests that India will be importing pulses and grains.

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai Port Authority (MPA) and the New Mangalore Port Authority (NMPA) are still awaiting the delivery of three patrol boats, more than eight months beyond the maximum stipulated timeline under their contracts. In the case of two other major ports — Paradip and VO Chidambarnar, two such boats were delivered late.The four major port authorities awarded these contracts to Mumbai-based Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd. Patrol boats for ports are specialized, fast, and agile vessels designed for security, surveillance, and law enforcement in harbours and coastal areas.The four major port authorities awarded these works to Mumbai-based Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works LtdThe MPA awarded a tender to the firm in September 2024 to hire two fully operational patrol boats for deployment over seven years. The boats were scheduled to be delivered by March 23, 2025, but the company failed to meet the deadline.Last month, the port authority issued a termination notice to the company, citing its failure to provide substitute patrol boats with similar technical specifications during the period of non-availability or delay. The letter, dated January 8, 2026, also stated that the delay had caused a loss of Rs 35 lakh to the port authority.The company was asked to confirm compliance by January 20, failing which the contract could be terminated.The MPA did not respond to repeated queries regarding the status of the contract.Similarly, the NMPA awarded a contract to the same firm in August 2024 for hiring one patrol boat, with delivery scheduled for May 2025. The company was permitted a delayed delivery until July 2025, subject to the maximum applicable liquidated damages. However, the boat has still not been delivered.A senior NMPA official said the contracted cost of the patrol boat was Rs 9.7 crore, and it remains undelivered. The port authority has also not terminated the contract despite the delay.Sources in the ports and shipping ministry said that since port authorities are empowered to take decisions regarding contracts and operations, they are responsible for initiating appropriate action.","The Mumbai Port Authority and the New Mangalore Port Authority are still awaiting the delivery of three patrol boats.

'White Collar Terrorism...': Ex-DGMO AK Bhatt On Biggest Challenge For The Army In Jammu & Kashmir

Security agencies in Jammu and Kashmir have identified and frozen over 8,000 “mule accounts” in the past three years.According to the officials, these accounts form the financial backbone of global scam networks and could fund separatist and anti-national activities.Officials described these accounts as the “weakest yet most crucial link” in the cybercrime chain, noting that without them, stolen money could not be converted into untraceable cryptocurrency , news agency PTI reported.Central security agencies have asked the Jammu and Kashmir Police and other law-enforcement bodies to consult with banks to curb the rise of mule accounts and identify middlemen commonly called “mulers” who facilitate these frauds.After the National Investigation Agency ’s 2017 crackdown on illicit money flows into the region, officials said anti-national elements may have shifted to a “digital hawala” model, where commissions earned by mule account holders could be used for activities against the country.A muler typically does not contact victims or send fraudulent links. Instead, officials said, their role is arranging and maintaining a steady supply of mule accounts for scammers while concealing their identities.Such accounts often belong to ordinary individuals lured with promises of “easy commission” and minimal risk. They are persuaded to give full control of their bank accounts, including their net banking credentials.Investigators found that a single scammer may be supplied with 10 to 30 mule accounts at a time. In several cases, accounts are opened in the names of fictitious companies, enabling large transactions of up to Rs 40 lakh in a single day without immediately raising alarms.Officials said the money trail is deliberately complex, with funds quickly shifted across multiple accounts and broken into smaller transactions to avoid detection.Law-enforcement agencies stressed that even if mule account holders do not design scams or interact with victims, they remain active facilitators of money laundering. “The entire scam ecosystem depends on these accounts. Without a destination for the money, the scam fails at the first step. Those renting out their accounts are not just victims of circumstance; they are the engines of the crime,” a senior official said.A study by central security agencies also found individuals in countries such as China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia directing people in the Union Territory to create private crypto wallets. These wallets are often set up using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to avoid detection and requiring no Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said that central projects worth around Rs 55,000 crore have been sanctioned for the state over the past year, marking significant progress on infrastructure commitments made earlier.Addressing a press conference, Sarma outlined a series of projects that have either received approval or are in advanced stages of clearance. He linked the developments to the commitments made during the second Advantage Assam investment summit.""The Centre had assured infrastructure projects worth Rs 80,000 crore during the second Advantage Assam investment summit last year, and the state has already received approval for different projects worth Rs 55,000 crore,"" he said.The ‘Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment and Infrastructure Summit’ was organised by the state government in February 2025 to attract investments and push major infrastructure expansion across the state.Among the key projects, Sarma said that the government has floated the tender for the Kamakhya Ropeway Project, which will connect Kamakhya railway station to the Kamakhya temple in Guwahati.""When the PM visits Assam next, he will lay the foundation for it,"" he said.He added that the Centre is likely to approve a Rs 1,500 crore project within the next few days to build an elevated corridor from Guwahati airport to Jalukbari, the main entry point to the state capital. The project is aimed at easing traffic congestion and improving connectivity.Sarma also said that a major highway expansion project is nearing final approval.""The Rs 14,000-crore project for four-laning of the national highway from Baihata Chariali to Tezpur is at last stages of approval. We hope for it very soon,"" he added.On the stalled Kamakhya corridor project, the Chief Minister said work is expected to resume soon after expert bodies found no ecological risks.""After some people opposed the corridor, the Gauhati High Court asked IIT Guwahati and the National Institute of Hydrology to study if the project would have any ecological impact. They said there would be no impact,"" he claimed.In the healthcare sector, Sarma said expansion works worth Rs 2,200 crore are underway at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, while projects worth Rs 600 crore are ongoing at Assam Medical College and Hospital.He further said that another strategic highway project is under consideration. The proposed route will connect the semiconductor plant at Jagiroad in Morigaon district to the Bhutan border via Udalguri and will include construction of a new bridge over the Brahmaputra river.""This project is under active consideration of the Centre. These strategic assets will also be used by civilians,"" Sarma said.Separately, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, on Friday approved the construction of India’s first 34-km-long twin-tube road-cum-rail tunnel under the Brahmaputra river between Gohpur and Numaligarh at a cost of Rs 18,662 crore.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that central projects worth around Rs 55,000 crore have been sanctioned for the state.

The politics of scent

The actor at the centre

More than just a soap

When a bar of soap becomes the centre of a political slugfest, one knows the story runs deeper than lather and fragrance.The appointment of actor Tamannaah Bhatia as the new brand ambassador of Karnataka ’s iconic Mysuru Sandal Soap has triggered a heated debate that cuts across politics, identity, branding strategy and regional pride.What began as a marketing announcement has spiralled into a controversy over language, representation and the cultural ownership of a 108-year-old legacy product.At the heart of the row is Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL), the government-owned company that manufactures Mysuru Sandal Soap. Founded during the reign of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the brand is not merely a commercial product. For many Kannadigas, it is an aromatic symbol of heritage.The controversy intensified after Karnataka industries minister MB Patil announced that Tamannaah Bhatia would serve a two-year tenure as brand ambassador for KSDL. The actor reportedly signed for a fee of approximately Rs 6.2 crore. Her contract, which was finalised last year, formally came into effect this month.The announcement coincided with the relaunch of Mysuru Sandal Soap in refreshed packaging and a broader strategy to reposition the brand for national and global markets.Several advertisements featuring the actor were unveiled at an event in Bengaluru, along with an expanded portfolio of nearly 60 products.But almost immediately, political opposition emerged.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP K Sudhakar accused the Congress-led Karnataka government of displaying what he called an “anti-Kannada mindset”.He questioned why a Mumbai-born actor was chosen to represent a brand rooted in Karnataka’s cultural identity when several Kannada film stars enjoy national and international recognition.He named actors such as Ramya, Rashmika Mandanna, Srinidhi Shetty , Pooja Hegde and Rukmini Vasanth, arguing that they have carried Kannada cinema to wider audiences and would have been more appropriate faces of the brand.The debate quickly moved from business logic to emotional ownership.To understand why a soap can trigger such strong reactions, one must go back to its origins.Mysuru Sandal Soap was born in 1916 in the princely state of Mysore. At the time, the region was rich in sandalwood, a precious and aromatic resource. During the First World War, the export of sandalwood was disrupted. Faced with surplus stock, the Mysore administration decided to explore value addition.Under the guidance of chemists and the encouragement of Maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the government established a soap factory that used pure sandalwood oil. The idea was simple but visionary. Instead of exporting raw material, produce a finished product of premium quality.The result was Mysore Sandal Soap, one of the few soaps in the world made with genuine sandalwood oil.In 1980, the operations were reorganised under Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL), a state enterprise. Over the decades, KSDL expanded into detergents, cosmetics and other personal care products. Yet the flagship soap remained its crown jewel.For many households in Karnataka, the soap is associated with childhood memories, temple visits, wedding gifts and the distinctive scent of sandalwood that lingers long after use.It is not merely hygiene. It is nostalgia.Minister MB Patil has defended the appointment, saying the decision was based purely on marketing considerations. According to him, KSDL is entering a transformative phase with ambitious targets. The company aims to achieve a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore by 2030.Currently, the company’s turnover is expected to touch around Rs 2,000 crore this year, with profits reportedly exceeding Rs 500 crore. However, only a small percentage of sales occur within Karnataka. Patil has said that roughly 8 to 12 per cent of sales are in the state, with significant portions in Telangana, other southern states, north India and a small international presence.The government’s argument is straightforward. If the brand wants to expand aggressively in North India and overseas markets, it needs a face with pan-India recognition.Tamannaah Bhatia, though born and brought up in Mumbai, has worked extensively in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi cinema. With millions of followers on social media and cross regional appeal, the government says she fits the bill.Officials have stated that several names were evaluated, including actors from Karnataka. However, some were reportedly endorsing competing brands, which made them ineligible under marketing norms.The state government maintains that branding decisions must align with commercial objectives, not political sentiment.Critics, however, view the decision through a different lens.For them, Mysuru Sandal Soap is intertwined with Karnataka’s linguistic and cultural pride. In a state where language identity remains politically sensitive, the selection of a non-Kannada-speaking actor to represent a heritage brand has symbolic implications.Mysuru MP Yaduveer Wadiyar , a descendant of the Mysore royal family, publicly questioned the rationale. He argued that soap is not gender-specific and that a cricketer or prominent Kannadiga could have been chosen. He also clarified that he had no interest in serving as brand ambassador himself, despite his name circulating on social media.Forest minister Eshwar Khandre defended the appointment but assured that Kannadigas would continue to receive priority in other contexts.Meanwhile, housing minister Zameer Ahmed indicated that although the decision had been taken, there were numerous capable Kannada actresses who could have been considered.The disagreement even within the ruling establishment reflects the sensitivity of the issue.For pro-Kannada groups, the controversy touches on a larger fear of cultural dilution. They argue that state-owned enterprises should reinforce regional identity rather than dilute it for broader appeal.Beyond the politics, KSDL is attempting a major brand refresh.At the recent relaunch event, the company unveiled 57 products, including new variants of soaps, sandalwood oil, jasmine scented bars, perfumes, toothpaste, coconut oil, petroleum jelly and organic lines. Two coffee table books documenting KSDL’s heritage were also released.The refreshed packaging aims to appeal to younger consumers who are increasingly drawn to premium natural and heritage brands.In recent years, India’s beauty and personal care market has undergone a rapid transformation. Consumers shifted towards global brands and K-beauty trends. However, there has also been a renewed interest in Ayurvedic and traditional formulations.Mysuru Sandal Soap, with its authentic sandalwood oil base, occupies a unique niche. It combines tradition with premium positioning.The launch of KSDL eStore, an e-commerce platform for its products, signals a shift toward digital retail. The company has established stock-keeping units closer to consumers to ensure timely delivery and freshness.In this context, the appointment of a high-profile celebrity ambassador is part of a broader strategy to reposition the brand as aspirational and nationally visible.The row highlights how even consumer goods can become sites of political contestation.In Karnataka, language and regional identity have historically shaped electoral politics. Debates over Hindi imposition, local employment and cultural representation frequently surface in public discourse. Against this backdrop, the choice of a brand ambassador becomes more than a marketing decision.Opposition leaders have framed the issue as evidence of disregard for Kannada pride. Supporters of the government argue that commercial pragmatism should not be conflated with cultural betrayal.The controversy also raises a larger question about public sector branding. Should government-owned companies prioritise regional representation as part of their mandate, or operate strictly on business metrics?For private corporations, such decisions are typically driven by reach, cost and market impact. But when the brand belongs to the state, expectations shift.Tamannaah Bhatia has not publicly commented on the controversy in detail. At the Bengaluru event, she described Mysuru Sandal Soap as deeply associated with emotion and trust. She said she felt privileged to be associated with an institution of such legacy.Her filmography spans multiple industries, and she enjoys a significant social media presence. From a marketing standpoint, that digital footprint is valuable in an era where brand recall is shaped as much by Instagram reels as by television commercials.Yet, the backlash shows that brand endorsement in India cannot be divorced from identity politics.Mysuru Sandal Soap’s enduring appeal lies in its authenticity. Unlike synthetic fragrance soaps, it reportedly uses genuine sandalwood oil, a resource historically associated with Karnataka. The state has long regulated sandalwood harvesting due to its high value and ecological importance.The soap’s emblem, featuring the royal insignia of Mysore, reinforces its historical roots. For many, it represents a time when princely states invested in industrial innovation and self-sufficiency.In that sense, the brand is a bridge between pre-independence industrial vision and modern state enterprise.As of now, the appointment stands. Tamannaah Bhatia’s two-year tenure has begun, and marketing campaigns are underway. KSDL is pushing forward with its expansion plans, eyeing higher turnover, greater exports and a stronger digital footprint.Whether the controversy fades or continues to simmer will depend on political developments and public reception.If the refreshed branding leads to significant growth in north India and overseas markets, the government may point to it as vindication of its strategy. If the backlash persists, opposition parties may continue to frame it as symbolic of deeper cultural concerns.","Tamannaah Bhatia is the new brand ambassador of Karnataka ’s iconic Mysuru Sandal Soap.

This week, it closed a corruption case that had dragged on for nearly 32 years - six years in trial court, 14 years in HC and 11 years in SC, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at Aurangabad on March 24, 1994. The trial court convicted the accused six years later on Apr 3, 2000. To concur with the trial court's decision, the Bombay HC took more than 14 years.On appeal, the case remained pending for a decade in the SC before getting listed for final hearing before a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan, which reserved the verdict on Aug 21 last year. On Friday, after nearly six months, Justice Mahadevan pronounced the judgment acquitting the accused.Justice Mahadevan said, “Both the trial court and the high court held that the appellants (accused) failed to furnish any satisfactory explanation or documentary justification for such possession (of cement bags). These findings are essentially factual and are supported by the evidence on record.”Despite the evidence against the accused, the bench of Justices Nagarathna and Mahadevan acquitted the accused saying the prosecution charged them under provisions of Essential Commodities Act when on the date of siphoning off cement, it was not a commodity covered under that law.“That said, this was a case where the investigating agency ought to have invoked appropriate provisions of the Indian Penal Code, having regard to the nature of the allegations and the evidence collected,” it said and acquitted the accused saying, “The lapse, therefore, lies squarely at the door of the investigating agency.”","The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at Aurangabad.

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet has approved infrastructure projects worth over Rs 31,000 crore, including construction of the country’s first road-cum-rail tunnel under the Brahmaputra in Assam. The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost Rs 18,662 crore.It will connect Gohpur and Numaligarh in Assam and will cut travel time from about 6 hours to just 20 minutes. The project, to be fully funded by govt, will not just reduce the travel distance from 240 km to roughly 34 km improving connectivity but also has strategic significance, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said while announcing the Cabinet decision. This four-lane tunnel will ensure high-speed connectivity to Arunachal and provide “strategic resilience” for defence purposes. The minister said the twin tubes would be interconnected at intervals of 500 metres.Officials said the tunnel would be built around 32 metres beneath the Brahmaputra’s lowest bed level. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track and no vehicular movement will be allowed when trains run through this tube.PM Modi called the Brahmaputra tunnel project as a “landmark boost to connectivity in the northeast”.In a post on X, he said, “...This transformative project will enhance connectivity, reduce logistics costs and accelerate growth across Assam and the entire Northeast.”TOI has learnt that originally govt had included the connectivity between Gohpur and Numaligarh as a part of the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for North East in 2008 by constructing a bridge. But later a proposal was mooted to build a road tunnel beneath the Brahmaputra. Later, it was modified to have a common tunnel for both vehicles and trains.A similar 22-km road-cumrail tunnel passing through Chicken Neck corridor in the northeast is also in planning stage. Besides the tunnel, Cabinet approved three NH projects with a combined cost of over Rs 11,000 crore — a 107.7-km fourlane highway in Gujarat, a 154.6-km highway stretch in Maharashtra and an 80-km corridor of NH-167 in Telangana.In rail sector, three multitracking projects covering 12 districts across Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Karnataka were approved at an estimated cost of Rs 18,509 crore. The approved projects will add 389 km to the existing network of railways. Multitracking works are scheduled for completion by March 2031. These include the laying of third and fourth line between Kasara and Manmad in Maharashtra, which will have the second longest tunnel on the rail network.","The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost Rs 18,662 crore.

NEW DELHI: The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers, and provided “considerable stability” at senior level, an ICRIER study has said.“Researchers note this moderation aligns with broader post-pandemic trends in the IT industry and cannot be attributed to AI adoption alone. Roles commonly perceived as most exposed to AI, such as software developers and database administrators, are also among those experiencing the strongest growth in demand, indicating that generative AI is primarily functioning as a productivity-enhancing complement to technical and analytical work, rather than a substitute,” said the report, which was backed by OpenAI and based on a survey of over 650 firms.Roles such as statisticians and mathematicians, application developers and database designers and administrators were among the most exposed — and had the highest demand — while HR, legal and finance professionals were least. The most impacted roles and skills include data entry and clerical work, followed by manual testing, manual quality assurance, and entry level programming.Among business functions in IT companies, software development and engineering, followed by IT infra and cloud services and project management were seen to be the most affected, the survey showed.The report said AI adoption is reshaping hiring priorities toward hybrid skills profiles combining domain expertise and AI and data-related technical skills, instead of narrow specialisation.While half the companies surveyed said they were investing in internal awareness and workforce reskilling, the report said: “The cause for concern, however, is that IT firms are not hiring enough workers with skills in large language model operations or expanding their R&D divisions, and, most importantly, are not investing adequately in training and upskilling. The shortage of qualified AI trainers, limited AI skills among new labour market entrants, and policy and regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI are challenges that must be urgently addressed. ”","The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers.

New Delhi : Unthinkable just a few years ago, when artificial intelligence was a shiny experiment — impressive demos, niche tools, and a buzzword that rarely touched daily life — today it sits at the heart of how jobs are created, services delivered, science conducted and societies governed. As the world grapples with both its promise and its risks, India is stepping into a new role, as not just a user of AI but also as a global agenda-setter, becoming the the first developing country and the first nation from the Global South to convene a global AI summit.Speaking exclusively to TOI , Abhishek Singh, CEO of India AI Mission and AI Impact Summit, believes that this is India’s attempt to pull the global AI debate away from elite labs and corporate boardrooms and anchor it in people, inclusion and real-world outcomes.“This is the first summit of its kind and scale being hosted in the Global South,” said Singh, adding, “AI today is largely controlled by a few countries and a few companies. India wants to bring the perspective of the Global South and ensure that AI is more inclusive and democratised.”India’s case for hosting the summit, Singh said, rests on experience rather than theory. Over the past decade, platforms such as Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker and telemedicine have shown how digital systems can operate at population scale, delivering services to hundreds of millions.“India has shown its ability to adopt technology for public services,” said Singh, “We want to showcase India’s strength in building AI applications at population scale and also be the voice of the Global South.”The summit comes at a time when govts worldwide are struggling to balance rapid AI innovation with growing concerns over deepfakes, misinformation, bias and misuse. While there is broad agreement that AI should drive economic growth and social good, Singh said translating principles into practice remains uneven.“Every country agrees on two things: AI must be used for larger social good; and harm from AI must be restricted,” he said. “But countries are at very different levels of technological development. That is where regulatory capacity and shared frameworks become important.” India’s approach, he explained, is based on what it calls a ‘techno-legal framework,’ combining legal safeguards with technological tools. Legal provisions require harmful content to be taken down within defined timelines and mandate labelling of AI-generated content, especially where it poses risks to individuals, public order or national security. Alongside this, India is developing tools to detect deepfakes, mitigate bias and create ethical AI certification systems.A major focus of the summit is human capital. As automation reshapes work and threatens traditional livelihoods, the summit aims to push global cooperation on reskilling and workforce transitions, particularly for developing economies facing resource constraints.“AI should not grow only in tech hubs,” Singh said. “We are setting up data labs across the country, centres of excellence in states and smaller cities, and running large-scale skilling and training programmes so that AI reaches tier-2 and tier-3 cities.” Inclusion is another central theme, with India highlighting the role of Indian-language and voicebased AI systems in expanding access. Platforms built on natural language processing and generative AI allow people to access services in their own languages, especially those uncomfortable with English.The summit’s agenda also spans AI-enabled scientific research in healthcare, agriculture and climate, while pushing for openness, reproducibility and shared standards.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be able to travel to India for the event.

No annual Rera reports in 75% of states: Forum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-annual-rera-reports-in-75-of-states-forum/articleshow/128365830.cms,"NEW DELHI: More than 75% of state real estate regulators, Reras, have either never published annual reports, discontinued their publication or not updated them despite statutory obligation and directions from the housing and urban affairs ministry, claimed homebuyers' body FPCE on Friday. It released status report of 21 Reras as of Feb 13.The availability of updated annual reports is crucial as these contain details of data on performance of Reras, including project completion status categorised by timely completion, completion with extensions, and incomplete projects. The ministry's format for publishing these reports also specifies providing details such as actual execution status of refund, possession and compensation orders as well as recovery warrant execution details with values and list of defaulting builders.FPCE said annual report data is not only vital for homebuyers to assess system credibility, but is equally necessary for both state and central govts to frame effective policies, design incentivisation schemes, and develop tax policy frameworks.""Unless we have credible data proving that after Rera the real estate sector has improved in terms of delivery, fairness, and keeping its promises, we are merely firing in the air,"" said FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay, who is also a member of the govt's Central Advisory Council on Rera.As per details shared by the entity, seven states - Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Goa - have never published a single annual report since Rera's implementation, and nine states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana, which initially published reports, have discontinued the practice.Upadhyay said when regulators themselves don't follow the law, they lose the legal right to demand compliance from other stakeholders.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Allocation pattern across key schemes

Sharp cut in MGNREGS allocation

Fund-sharing pattern and fiscal implications

Employment trends under MGNREGS

PMAY-G progress and challenges

VB-G RAM G, the scheme set to replace Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), has received the highest share in this year’s Budget for the department of rural development, accounting for about 40 per cent of its total allocation, according to an analysis by PRS Legislative Research.The PRS analysis said VB-G RAM G has been allocated Rs 95,692 crore in the Budget, making up around 40 per cent of the Department of Rural Development’s total outlay.The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) accounts for 23 per cent of the department’s Budget. This is followed by MGNREGS at 12 per cent, the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) at 8 per cent, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) at 8 per cent, and the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) at 4 per cent, as per news agency PTI.In 2026–27, VB-G RAM G (40 per cent) and PMAY-G (23 per cent) together account for 63 per cent of the ministry’s total gross expenditure, followed by MGNREGS (12 per cent), NRLM (8 per cent), PMGSY (8 per cent) and NSAP (4 per cent), the report said.The ministry of rural development has been allocated Rs 1,97,023 crore in 2026–27, which is 4 per cent higher than the revised estimates for 2025–26.Within this, the department of rural development has been allocated Rs 1,94,369 crore, 4 per cent higher than the revised estimates of 2025–26.The department of land resources has been allocated Rs 2,654 crore, marking a 51 per cent increase over last year’s revised estimates.The allocation for MGNREGS this year stands at Rs 30,000 crore, 66 per cent lower than the revised estimate of Rs 88,000 crore last year, as per PTI.In contrast, most other schemes have seen higher allocations. PMAY-G has been allocated Rs 54,917 crore, reflecting a 66 per cent increase over the previous fiscal year’s revised estimate.PMGSY has received Rs 19,000 crore, a 73 per cent rise compared to last year’s revised estimate.The report noted that under MGNREGS, wage payments accounted for around 70 per cent of total expenditure over the last five years. Material costs made up about 26 per cent of expenditure, of which roughly 20 per cent was borne by the Centre. Overall, the Centre bore around 90 per cent of the total expenditure under the scheme.“With the change in fund sharing pattern under the VB-G RAM G Act, the expenditure by state governments on the scheme may increase,” the report said.Under the VB-G RAM G Act, which guarantees 125 days of work, the Centre and states will share expenditure in a 60:40 ratio. For northeastern and Himalayan states, the ratio will be 90:10, as per PTI.According to the analysis, over the past decade, employment under MGNREGS averaged around 48 days per household per year.Less than 10 per cent of participating households completed 100 days of work. In 2020–21, average days of employment rose to 52 days per household due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Employment generation moderated thereafter, recording 50 days per household in 2024–25, reported PTI.On average, seven crore households demanded work during 2017–25, of which six crore households, around 90 per cent, were able to avail employment.The report also highlighted that actual wages paid to workers have often been lower than the notified rates. In 2025–26 (as of December 2025), wages received by workers were below the notified wage rate in 20 out of 31 states and Union Territories.For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, workers received Rs 268 against a notified Rs 307. In Chhattisgarh, workers were paid Rs 245 compared to Rs 261, and in Gujarat, Rs 264 against Rs 288.In Karnataka, workers received Rs 342 compared to the notified Rs 370. The gap was wider in Rajasthan (Rs 221 versus Rs 281) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 268 versus Rs 336), while in Telangana workers received Rs 259 against a notified Rs 307.Under rural housing, PMAY-G has been allocated Rs 54,917 crore, a 69 per cent increase, according to the report.However, only around 70 per cent of the targeted houses across phases have been completed so far.Delays have been attributed to issues such as land availability, migration, Covid-related disruptions and beneficiary-level constraints, the report said.","VB-G RAM G has been allocated Rs 95,692 crore in the Budget, making up around 40 per cent of the Department of Rural Development’s total outlay.

What does the law say about side hustles for H-1B visa holders?





With several guns trained at H-1Bs in the US and especially in Texas, several social media posts have now flagged home kitchen businesses being run by visa holders 'illegally'. H-1B and their dependents H-4 visas are not legally permitted to do a side hustle in the US and the laws are so strict that content creators are not allowed to monetize their channels but people are advertising their small catering services in closed Facebook or WhatsApp groups hiding from the public eye and scrutiny, the allegations said.One such post showed that an Indian woman in McKinney is offering North Indian crusine for small parties and occasions, for minimum 12 to 15 people. The allegation pointed out that this is illegal by McKinney's local laws as they must have a food establishment permit, have regular inspections and can not operate hot meal catering from a residential kitchen.The allegation pointed out that such operations are illegal on two counts: One, if they are on H-1B or H-4 visas, but if they are not visa holders, then also it is illegal as the Texas Cottage Food Law only allows baked goods to be made at a residential kitchen -- not hot trays.H-1B status authorizes the visa holders to work only for the specific employer that petitioned for (and received approval of) their H-1B petition, and only in the specific specialty occupation and conditions described in that petition. Any other employment whether it's freelancing, driving for Uber/DoorDash, consulting on the side, independent contracting, running a side business that involves active work, or even some content creation/coding gigs is considered unauthorized employment by USCIS.The income may be small, and the clients may be outside the US.Passive income is allowed from investment, stocks, rental as long as they do not require the visa holder's active participation.H-4 visa holders with EAD can own and operate a business as long as it does not violate any other laws.",Social media posts have now flagged home kitchen businesses being run by visa holders 'illegally' H-1B and their dependents H-4 visas are not legally permitted to do a side hustle in the US and the laws are so strict that content creators are not allowed to monetize their channels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128316059,imgsize-1181297,width-400,resizemode-4/can-h-1b-visa-holders-maintain-a-side-income-in-the-us.jpg"

Why Big Tech is lining up for AI in India

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will not be traveling to India for the India AI Impact Summit 2026, the company has said. The announcement cited “unforeseen circumstances” for the cancellation, as per a report by news agency Reuters. Huang is widely considered as one of the headline attractions for the five-day event, and was scheduled to address the media on February 18. Nvidia said that it is sending a high-level delegation to represent the company and reiterated its deep commitment to India’s rapidly growing AI and semiconductor ecosystem.""Due to unforeseen circumstances, Jensen Huang is unable to travel to India at this time. NVIDIA remains deeply committed to the AI Impact Summit and to India’s rapidly advancing AI ecosystem. A senior NVIDIA delegation, led by Executive Vice President Jay Puri, will be on the ground to celebrate India’s exceptional AI researchers, startups, developers, and the partners building the nation’s AI infrastructure,” the company said in a statement.The India AI Impact Summit 2026, scheduled to be held from February 16-20 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, is the first global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the 5-day event. CEOs and top executives of the biggest tech companies are all expected to attend.So are 15-20 heads of government, over 50 international ministers, and more than 40 Indian and global CEOs.The summit is organised around three pillars called 'Sutras' — People, Planet, and Progress.

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Anthropic CEO frames AI chips as a national security chokepoint, not a trade commodity

Why Amodei says 'growth will come easy' but political freedom won't

The Nvidia-Anthropic rivalry is becoming the defining feud in AI policy

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has once again made it clear that he thinks selling advanced AI chips to China is a terrible idea. In a wide-ranging conversation on the Dwarkesh Patel podcast, Amodei laid out his case for why the US should keep its compute advantage locked down—directly contradicting what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been lobbying Washington to do for months now.Amodei didn't mince words. He said the US shouldn't be building data centres in China or shipping chips there, arguing that AI models powered by those chips are ""essentially cognition, essentially intelligence."" His framing was blunt: sell cures for diseases to whoever wants them, build pharmaceutical industries in developing nations, but keep the data centres and the chips firmly out of authoritarian hands.He even floated a scenario where AI tools could be designed to protect citizens inside authoritarian countries from their own governments' surveillance—a kind of individualized digital shield. It's a bold idea, and Amodei admitted he doesn't know if it would work. But he seemed genuinely interested in exploring it.This isn't the first time Amodei has gone after Nvidia's China ambitions. At Davos last month, he compared selling H200 chips to China to ""selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and bragging that Boeing made the casings."" On the podcast, he went further—warning that if both the US and China end up with equally powerful AI systems, the result could be a standoff far more dangerous than nuclear deterrence.His reasoning: unlike nukes, where mutually assured destruction keeps things stable, two rival AI superpowers might each believe they'd win a direct confrontation. That kind of mutual overconfidence, Amodei argued, is historically what starts wars. He also raised the prospect of offensive cyber dominance—a threshold where one side's AI could make every computer system transparent to it, unless the other side has an equally strong defence.Amodei also reframed the entire export debate around something bigger than quarterly revenue. He said economic growth from AI will arrive almost ""faster than we can take it."" The hard part won't be generating value—it'll be distributing it fairly and protecting political freedom in a world where authoritarian governments can weaponise AI against their own people.Rather than cutting developing nations out of the AI boom, he suggested building data centres in Africa and ensuring AI-driven industries like biotech take root outside the West. The pitch: spread the benefits without handing authoritarian governments the keys to the entire AI stack.He went as far as to say that dictatorships might eventually become ""morally obsolete""—not because someone overthrows them, but because the technology itself makes that form of government unworkable. Whether that's optimism or wishful thinking is up for debate.What makes all of this spicier is that Nvidia has poured over $10 billion into Anthropic. Yet Amodei keeps publicly torching Nvidia's biggest policy ask. Huang, for his part, has accused Amodei of wanting more AI regulation only because it benefits Anthropic's competitive position. He's also taken shots at Amodei's warning that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs, calling it self-serving fear-mongering.The two have been trading barbs for the better part of a year now—and if this podcast is anything to go by, neither seems remotely interested in backing down.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei opposes selling advanced AI chips to China.

KOLKATA: Bengal chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty on Saturday held a meeting with the DMs and other senior officials to implement the Swanirbhar Bangla scheme, which was announced by CM Mamata Banerjee last week. The Swanirbhar Bangla comprises schemes like Banglar Yuva Sathi, Lakshmir Bhandar, the farm workers welfare scheme and the water tax waiver scheme for farmers, and camps will be organised in all assembly constituencies from Sunday.Registration for the scheme will remain open between Feb 15 and 26. Unemployed youths can enrol for the Banglar Yuva Sathi if they qualified the Madhyamik exam and are in the age group of 21 to 40 years. This scheme will entitle them to a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500 from April for a maximum period of five years, if they fail to get a job during this period. The finance minister, Chandrima Bhattacharya, announced this scheme during the vote-on-account. The youths will get a direct bank transfer.Similarly, women who are eligible but not yet enrolled can submit their forms for Lakshmir Bhandar. From Feb, women beneficiaries of the general caste get Rs 1,500 monthly, and those from SC/ST communities get Rs 1,700 monthly. For farm workers who are not enrolled even as sharecroppers, there will be a transfer of Rs 4,000 to these farmers who are without any land, and they will get it in 2 tranches. They can apply by Feb 26.","The Swanirbhar Bangla comprises schemes like Banglar Yuva Sathi, Lakshmir Bhandar, the farm workers welfare scheme and the water tax waiver scheme for farmers.

He dragged her into nearby bushes, sexually assaulted her, and recorded the act on his mobile phone before uploading the video online.An FIR was subsequently registered under IPC Section 376(3) (punishment for rape of a woman under sixteen years of age) and relevant provisions of the Pocso Act, and the man was arrested. He was, however, granted bail a few months later.""After a thorough trial and examination of all evidence and witnesses, the court on Friday delivered its verdict, sentencing the man to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment,"" said additional district government counsel (ADGC) Mahesh Singh on Saturday.The court, in its order, remarked, ""The accused's entire act is punishable under the Indian Penal Code and the POCSO Act. Therefore, in the current circumstances, it seems justified to detain him in prison for reform efforts, keeping him away from society and family. Due to the young age of the accused and his being the sole breadwinner and financial support of his family, it seems justified to keep the fine imposed against him low in comparison to the expenses incurred in the treatment and rehabilitation of the victim. ""The judge imposed a fine of Rs 30,000 on the convict, of which Rs 15,000 will be given to the survivor, and if he fails to pay it, he will have to undergo an additional eight months in jail.","A Pocso court in Aligarh has sentenced a 25-year-old man to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment for raping a 16-year old girl in 2021.
