The United States of America has announced the return of over 1,400 looted artifacts worth nearly $10 million to India, according to a press statement by Manhattan district attorney’s office.The stolen antiquities which are being returned include a sandstone sculpture of a Celestial Dancer, stolen from a temple in Madhya Pradesh, in the early 1980s. It was looted and divided in two to make it easier to smuggle and sell.Professionally reassembled, the sculpture was later donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by one of Kapoor’s clients. The Celestial Dancer remained on display at the Met until it was finally seized by the Art Theft Unit (ATU) in 2023.“Today’s repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multi-year, international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of history’s most prolific offenders. HSI New York and our colleagues at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have worked tirelessly with our partners in India and beyond to disrupt and dismantle the smuggling networks and in turn recover these invaluable pieces,” said HSI New York special agent in charge William S Walker in the statement.The recovered pieces were part of multiple ongoing investigations into criminal trafficking networks, including those tied to alleged antiquities trafficker Subhash Kapoor and convicted trafficker Nancy Wiener. The probe has found five individuals guilty.","The United States of America has announced the return of over 1,400 looted artifacts worth nearly $10 million to India.

Supreme Court had later ruled that though ED is free to challenge the withdrawal of the FIR, in absence of a predicate offence, the PMLA probe cannot be continued against the accused.ED then moved Madras high court, which on October 28 ruled that the withdrawal of the corruption case, ""predicate offence"" in ED's parlance, was illegal, and validated ED's case under PMLA while also asking state authorities to revive the corruption case.","Santiago Martin is India's biggest political donor having contributed Rs 1,368 crore through electoral bonds to all parties including DMK.

As Jake Paul and Mike Tyson face off this Friday, Netflix has its own stakes to consider. This marks the streaming giant’s biggest live sports event yet, with potential impact on future NFL and WWE deals.Streaming live from AT&T Stadium, it will be available to Netflix’s 280 million subscribers at no extra cost. Delayed due to Tyson’s medical emergency, Netflix has kept expectations under wraps, what does this mean for their future in live sports? Keep reading to find out.JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth stands firm in his belief that the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could set a new record as the most-watched boxing match in history. While surpassing Muhammad Ali's iconic bouts, which drew an estimated one billion viewers globally, may be a lofty goal, the 4.6 million viewers from the 2015 Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight might be within reach.Anmuth explains “We believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX’s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,"" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. He also notes that Netflix’s increasing focus on sports entertainment and live events, especially with NFLX’s growing negotiating leverage, will only enhance its reach. (via: Independent)Netflix has already begun utilizing live sports as complementary programming to its popular documentaries and series. A prime example is the three-part documentary series Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson, which has quickly climbed the ranks, securing the second spot among Netflix's most-viewed shows.In addition, the platform’s recent ventures, such as last November’s Netflix Cup pairing Formula 1 drivers with PGA golfers demonstrate its expanding sports portfolio. Their March exhibition match featuring Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz was tied into promotional content for upcoming documentaries.

The platform will carry WWE events globally, excluding the U.S., including major live events like WrestleMania and SummerSlam.According to media consultant Patrick Crakes, Netflix’s push into live sports is a smart ""dry run"" for handling larger volumes of live events, adding,“It could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.” As Netflix continues to grow its sports entertainment presence, the stakes are high and so are the expectations.","Streaming live from AT&T Stadium, it will be available to Netflix’s 280 million subscribers at no extra cost.

5.6 lakh Indians migrated to rich OECD countries in 2022,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-6-lakh-indians-migrated-to-rich-oecd-countries-in-2022/articleshow/115315069.cms,"Representative photo

Citizenship Trends:

MUMBAI: Each year, Indians continue their journey overseas, with many drawn to rich nations like the US, UK, and Canada — countries within the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that have historically opened doors to them. Whether as new immigrants, international students, or those acquiring citizenship, Indians dominate the charts in immigration flows to OECD nations. However, recent protectionist policies hint that the open path may be narrowing.2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries — a substantial 35% jump over the previous year. India maintained its lead as the top source of new migrants, with China following at 3.2 lakh. Indians made up 6.4% of all new immigrants to OECD countries, while China contributed 3.8%.A notable shift was Russia’s rise in the migration ranks. With 2.6 lakh Russians migrating to OECD nations in 2022, Russia surged from 18th place to displace Romania.The International Migration Outlook 2024, released on Thursday in Paris, detailed these shifts. In 2022, the UK welcomed 1.12 lakh Indians, nearly double the figure from 2021, while 1.25 lakh Indians migrated to the US, marking a 35% increase. Canada, however, saw a dip with 1.18 lakh Indians, an 8% decline from the previous year. In these countries, Indians predominantly migrated through labour pathways, often as principal applicants or as accompanied family members.China, too, resumed significant migration following two years of Covid-related restrictions. In 2022, over three lakh Chinese immigrants to OECD member countries, up 13% from the previous year. Particularly in the US, migration flows from China jumped by 37%, returning to pre-pandemic levels with 68,000 new arrivals.Russia and Romania, which contributed 2.7 lakh new immigrants each, were the next top origin countries. Meanwhile, Türkiye, Israel, and Germany emerged as the primary OECD destinations for Russian migrants. Romanians, on the other hand, largely headed to Germany, Spain, and Italy.Yet, the welcome for new immigrants is visibly less enthusiastic. Under the incoming Trump administration, immigration to the US may face tighter scrutiny, including on work visas. Canada, too, recently announced a planned cut in immigration targets for the next three years, and the UK has introduced protectionist policies, such as raising wage thresholds and reducing the list of shortage occupations.In 2022, over 1.9 lakh Indians took the nationality of an OECD country, marking a 40% increase and securing India’s place as the top origin country for new OECD citizens. This record was largely driven by a threefold increase in Indians acquiring Canadian citizenship, totalling 60,000. The report anticipates a further rise in 2023.Syria ranked second in 2022, with 1.34 lakh nationals gaining OECD citizenship—a 28% increase from 2021—followed by Morocco, with 1.21 lakh Moroccan nationals becoming citizens in Spain, Italy, and France. Mexicans largely acquired American citizenship, in 2022 their numbers dipped slightly.","2022 proved to be a landmark year — a record 5.6 lakh Indians moved to OECD countries.

The heavily-bracketed draft text was released on Friday without actually addressing the concerns of developing countries . Though the number of pages of the new text was reduced from 34 to 25 by removing inconsequential options, the key points of concerns of the Global South continue to be there without any acceptable changes.India through its intervention during high-level meeting on the issue also linked developing countries' move to update their climate action targets next year with climate finance commitment of rich nations, saying such a scenario (adequate financial support) is ""vital for advancing towards COP30 , where all parties (countries) are expected to submit their updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)"". The remark is a clear message to Global North (rich nations) that the developing countries won't be able set ambitious emission cut targets unless provided with adequate and 'no strings attached' finance.India put across its point, in sync with demand of developing countries, through the intervention on Thursday on behalf of Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) representing over 20 nations during climate negotiations. Earlier, G77 plus China group, representing over 130 developing countries, had given a similar pitch in the submission, making it clear that anything less than $1.3 trillion annual finance flow from developed to developing countries for climate action may not be acceptable to the Global South.Making the intervention, Naresh Pal Gangwar, environment ministry's additional secretary and India's lead negotiator at C0, also reiterated developing countries' consistent stand on negotiation process and climate finance, indicating that dilution of principles of UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement will not be acceptable to the Global South keeping in view the historical responsibilities of rich nations.","India has asked developed countries to commit to provide and mobilise at least $1.3 trillion every year till 2030 through grants, concessional finance and non- debt-inducing support.

Cornea transplant wait list on centralised platform soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cornea-transplant-wait-list-on-centralised-platform-soon/articleshow/115345374.cms,"NEW DELHI: Soon, the list of patients waiting for cornea transplant in India will be available on a centralised platform. While waiting lists for organs such as heart, liver and kidney are available centrally, on website of National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), no such list was available for cornea till date.Recently, NOTTO director Dr Anil Kumar has written to all the states/UTs to issue a directive to registered hospitals and eye banks to share the data related to list of patients waiting for cornea transplant, number of cornea donation and transplantation, and number of cornea stored and utilised.Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye. It allows light to enter and performs two-thirds of the focusing tasks. For people suffering from vision loss due to irreparable damage of the tissue, transplant is the only option. It involves replacing a diseased or scarred cornea with cornea donated by a deceased person.Dr Namrata Sharma, a professor of ophthalmology at AIIMS, who is also associated with Eye Bank Association of India, said India needs nearly two lakh corneas per year to treat patients suffering from blindness caused irreparable damage to the tissue.""In 2023-24, only 49,315 corneas were collected of which 27,394 could be used for transplant,"" Dr Sharma said, adding that availability of information related to cornea collection and utilisation would help policymakers to ensure optimum utilisation of tissues collected and equitable distribution as well.The NOTTO has said that eye banks operating across the country should have a minimum 100 collections in a year or they could risk losing the licence to operate.India has about 726 registered eye banks but, govt sources said, only about 200 are operational. ""Many eye banks are opened for govt aid or as a prerequisite to start post-graduate courses in ophthalmology. But they aren't maintained optimally,"" said a source.The latest directive by NOTTO, the nodal agency for allocation and distribution of organs and tissues in the country, states that state authorities should examine the data on eye/cornea collection annually by the registered eye banks and in case of less performance, they can consider issuing a warning notice to the eye bank for augmenting their eye donation activities. ""... otherwise in case of under-performance their renewal may not be considered for the next term,"" the order says.","Cornea is the transparent tissue that covers the eye.

NEW DELHI: In a major shift in policy to regulate manufacture and sale of health supplements in the country, an inter-ministerial committee has suggested that supplements claiming to cure or mitigate any specific disease should be considered a drug and, therefore, come under the purview of Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO).Currently, all such products come under the purview of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The committee, headed by former health secretary Apurva Chandra, has suggested they should be brought under the purview of CDSCO. This would mean more scrutiny of such products before licencing and increased penalty on making false claims about disease-risk reduction.Main reason why many companies transfer some products from medicine or drug category to dietary supplements category is to escape price regulation. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) regulates pricing of drugs and ensures availability of medicines at affordable prices.While NPPA has the authority to monitor and fix prices of drugs, it cannot take any action if the same drug is re-launched as a food supplement. The recommendation to categorise many health supplements as drugs will, therefore, have an impact on pricing of these products as well, officials said.Other steps suggested include a separate provision of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), establishing a dedicated cell for monitoring of advertisements for such products.","An inter-ministerial committee has suggested that supplements claiming to cure or mitigate any specific disease should be considered a drug.

PATNA/NEW DELHI: Modi government 's effort to canonise Birsa Munda , who valiantly stood up to British might, as a national icon has gathered momentum, with PM Modi regretting the failure to acknowledge the heroic fight the legendary tribal warrior put up against the colonial rulers.""As we celebrate Janjatiya Gaurav Divas , it is important to understand why this event is necessary. It is an honest effort to correct a great injustice in history. The contribution of the tribal community was not given the recognition in history it deserved after independence,"" the PM said while addressing a function in Bihar's Jamui which is close to the border of the Santhal Pargana region of Jharkhand to which Birsa Munda belonged.Modi govt has decided to celebrate 150th birth anniversary of the tribal hero as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas and PM marked the day by inaugurating and laying foundation of projects worth Rs 6,000 crore.The day also saw home minister Amit Shah unveiling a statue of Birsa Munda at the intersection at Sarai Kale Khan ISBT in Delhi which has been named after the leader of 'Ulgulan', the great tumult, that challenged the British.Modi blamed neglect of Munda and other tribal leaders who were part of the anti-colonial struggle to the effort to glorify the first PM Jawaharlal Nehru and his descendants to exclusion of others. ""The effort was that members of one party and one family got credit,"" Modi said, without mentioning any names.""The tribal community is the one that led centuries-long fight to protect Bharat's culture and freedom. However, following Independence, attempts were made to erase this contribution from tribal history, driven by selfish politics to give credit for Bharat's freedom solely to one party. But if only one family secured Independence, then why did the 'Ulgulan' movement led by Birsa Munda happen? What was Santhal Rebellion? What was Kol Rebellion?"" he asked.The speech reflected BJP's concern to integrate tribals into larger nationalist stream as a counter to attempts to cast them as a separate entity whose interests were at odds with majority community.In Delhi, Shah spoke along the same lines after unveiling Birsa Munda's statue. ""At a very young age, he raised his voice against religious conversion,"" Shah said of Birsa Munda who died at the young age of 25. ""When the whole of India and two-thirds of the world was ruled by British, Birsa Munda displayed the courage of standing firmly against religious conversion and later this determination and bravery transformed him into a leader of this country,"" the home minister added.Shah added that Munda was the first one to champion the primacy of tribals' claims on resources - jal, jungle, jameen (water, forests, land) - in their traditional lands.",Modi govt has decided to celebrate 150th birth anniversary of the tribal hero as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas.

As per the World Health Organization, driving under the influence of alcohol and any psychoactive substances increases the risk of a crash that results in death or serious injuries.In the case of drunk driving, the risk of a road traffic crash starts at low levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and increases significantly when the driver’s BAC is ≥ 0.04 (grams of ethanol per deciliter) or g/dL. In the case of drug-driving, the risk of incurring a road traffic crash is increased to differing degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used, as per WHO.As per US Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA), as alcohol levels rise in a person’s system, the negative effects on the central nervous system increase. “At a BAC of .08 grams of alcohol per deciliter (g/dL) of blood, crash risk increases exponentially,” it says.","Drunk driving fatalities in India have been declining in recent years.

Adjusting to a New Role Under JJ Redick

A Team on the Rise

D'Angelo Russell ’s future with the Los Angeles Lakers seems uncertain as trade rumors swirl around the veteran guard. Despite the team’s positive 7-4 start, Russell's performance hasn’t been up to par, leading to his demotion from the starting lineup after eight games. Averaging 12.5 points, 2.2 rebounds, and 4.7 assists with shooting splits of 40.2% overall and 31.3% from beyond the arc, he hasn't quite found his rhythm this season.Also read - ""‘Scripted or Legendary?

However, he’s no stranger to this kind of uncertainty, having faced similar situations last season. On a recent episode of, Russell shared his thoughts on dealing with trade talk in his tenth NBA season compared to previous years.Reflecting on his mindset, Russell said:Now in his tenth season, Russell emphasized a different approach:The shift in Russell’s role came as Lakers coach JJ Redick opted to move him to the bench, prioritizing ball movement and better fit with the starting unit. With the likes of LeBron James, Austin Reaves, and Anthony Davis commanding most of the playmaking duties, Russell’s usage rate has dropped to 19.6% this season from 22.2% last yearSince the change, Russell has shown improvement, particularly in a sixth-man role. His numbers have edged up, averaging 13.7 points on 47.1% shooting, including a solid 36.8% from three. The Lakers have benefited from his adjustment, going 3-0 since the lineup tweak. The move also helped solidify the rotation, balancing the offensive output of the bench while addressing defensive gaps in the starting lineupWith the Lakers finding success in this new setup, it remains to be seen whether Russell will be part of their long-term plans or if the front office will look to make a trade as his contract nears its end. For now, he’s focused on contributing in his adapted role and making the most of his time in Los Angeles, no matter where it may lead next.Also read - ""Iron Mike vs. The Maverick: Why Shaq’s Betting 1 Million on Tyson Despite the Odds""","D'Angelo Russell's future with the Los Angeles Lakers is uncertain.

President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller , known for his strong stance on immigration, as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration. Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed the appointment on Monday, congratulating Miller on X, calling him “another fantastic pick by the president.” Miller has been one of Trump’s closest aides since his first presidential campaign and was a senior adviser during Trump’s first term. He has played a central role in many policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including the 2018 family separation policy.Additionally, on Sunday, Trump announced that former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan would serve as the administration’s “Border Czar.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared that Homan would oversee border security , including the Southern and Northern Borders, as well as maritime and aviation security. Homan, a longtime ally of Trump, is also being considered for the role of Secretary of Homeland Security. Trump praised Homan’s expertise in border control, stating he would also oversee deportation policies.Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. According to a Forbes report, the Trump administration’s stance has often been at odds with economic consensus, which suggests that high-skilled immigrants and international students benefit the US economy. The administration worked to decouple study in the US from work opportunities, particularly through H-1B visa restrictions, making it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation. The Cruz-Sessions bill, which reflects Miller’s influence, proposed significant barriers for H-1B visa holders, requiring them to work abroad for 10 years before qualifying to work in the U.S., and setting a high minimum salary of $110,000. The bill also sought to restrict Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students, a policy that was nearly eliminated by a Trump administration regulation.Homan and Miller are anticipated to work closely in the upcoming administration to implement these restrictive immigration measures, with Homan overseeing border control and deportation, as well as maritime and aviation security.Miller argues that the H-1B program can lead to American worker displacement and wage suppression. During Trump’s first term, policies were introduced under Miller’s influence to tighten H-1B regulations, including raising denial rates and narrowing the definition of “specialty occupation,” reducing the positions eligible for H-1B workers.These potential changes may discourage U.S. companies from hiring Indian tech talent, limiting opportunities for those seeking employment in the US.Stephen Miller, born on August 23, 1985, in Santa Monica, California, was raised in a Jewish family with a conservative ideology that influenced his early political views and career choices.Miller attended Duke University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Duke, he became a prominent conservative voice on campus, frequently contributing to publications and engaging in political debates. His early career included positions as a press secretary for U.S. Representatives Michele Bachmann and John Shadegg, where he developed a strong foundation in political communication.In 2016, Miller joined Donald Trump’s presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor. After Trump’s election, he took on the role of senior advisor for policy and White House director of speechwriting from 2017 to 2021. Miller played a significant role in crafting Trump’s major speeches, including the inaugural address, and was instrumental in shaping the administration’s stringent immigration policies. He was one of the chief architects of the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and the family separation policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration at the U.S. border.Following Trump’s first term, Miller founded America First Legal , an organization dedicated to advancing conservative legal principles and challenging policies of the Biden administration. Through this platform, Miller continued to impact public policy, focusing on immigration and national security, key areas of his earlier work.In November 2024, after Donald Trump’s re-election, Miller was appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy in the White House. In this role, he is expected to oversee the administration’s policy agenda, especially concerning immigration and national security.Miller is married to Katie Waldman, former press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence. The couple has three children. Throughout his career, Miller has been a divisive figure, gaining praise from supporters for his unwavering conservative principles and facing criticism from opponents for his hardline stance on immigration and involvement in controversial policies.Miller’s career has been marked by several controversies.

What the investigation revealed

NEW DELHI: Six young lives, including three women, died in a high-speed collision at ONGC Chowk in Dehradun early Tuesday. The MUV they were traveling in rammed into a container truck, leaving the vehicle mangled. The sole survivor, 25-year-old Siddhesh Agrawal, who was driving, remains in critical condition.The victims, aged 19 to 24, included Guneet Singh, Kamakshi Singhal, Navya Goyal, Rishabh Jain, Atul Agrawal, and Kunal Kukreja. They were returning from a party hosted by Siddhesh at his residence.Following the gathering, the group decided on a late-night drive, which ended in the fatal crash.Around 1:30am., the MUV, reportedly speeding at over 100 km/h, approached the busy ONGC Chowk.CCTV footage shows the MUV speeding at over 100 km/h and attempting to overtake a luxury car before misjudging the distance and slamming into the truck. The impact was so severe that the MUV's roof was torn off, killing six on the spot.Three of the deceased were students at a private university and one was an engineering graduate.The accident’s precise details remain partially unclear due to non-functional CCTV cameras at ONGC Chowk, offline after a ransomware attack. Dehradun Smart City Limited (DSCL) confirmed that out of 536 cameras in the city, 134 remain non-operational, including the one crucial to this case.Local authorities and police have cited the group’s excessive speed as the primary cause of the crash. The container truck driver fled the scene, though officials suggest he wasn’t at fault.Police investigations have also revealed that the MUV was being driven with an air of casual disregard for traffic norms, a pattern seen among many young drivers in the region.Police are consulting legal experts to determine potential actions in a tragic car crash that claimed six young lives, including three women and left one survivor, Siddhesh Agrawal, critically injured.Siddhesh, the sole survivor, is currently hospitalised with a severe head injury and remains unable to provide a statement.Preliminary investigations have revealed that the accident occurred when a speeding multi-utility vehicle (MUV) collided with the rear left section of a container truck, a blind spot for large commercial vehicles. Authorities have found no fault on the part of the truck driver.Complicating the legal process, the car’s owner, who was driving at the time of the crash, also lost his life in the incident. Police are exploring legal options in the absence of complaints from the victims' families.According to the initial investigation, the MUV, likely a new vehicle without number plates, was traveling from Ballupur Chowk towards Garhi Cantt when it was overtaken at high speed by a luxury car.In an attempt to catch up, the MUV driver accelerated. Meanwhile, a container truck was crossing the intersection at a steady pace.Misjudging the timing, the MUV driver believed they could clear the intersection before the truck passed. However, the speeding MUV collided with the truck’s rear left side, resulting in the fatal crash.","Six young people, aged 19 to 24, were killed in a car crash in Dehradun, India, early Tuesday morning.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

""I think there's some rumours around outside there that I'm losing weight and stuff,"" she said. ""No, I'm actually right at the same amount.""Williams is one of the two astronauts whose stay at the space station was stretched from eight days to eight months because of propulsion problems with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft that took them there in June.

A whistleblower report on the U.S. government's secret UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) program was made public, sparking a renewed discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the potential government cover-ups surrounding these phenomena. The report, titled Immaculate Constellation, was released by Representative Nancy Mace and presented during a Congressional hearing held on the same day.The hearing was titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth”, and it addressed several pressing questions about UAPs: Are we being observed by intelligent extraterrestrial life? Has the U.S. government been concealing evidence about UAPs? Has the government recovered any non-human biological materials from UAPs? And most critically, does the U.S. possess any UAPs?In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Representative Mace raised pointed questions: “If UAPs don’t exist, why are taxpayer dollars being spent on something that isn’t real? And if they do exist, why is this information being deliberately hidden from the public?” These questions set the stage for an intense session where whistleblowers testified, some making alarming claims about the U.S. government's handling of UAP data and technology.The hearing featured testimony from four key figures—Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense official; Tim Gallaudet, a retired rear admiral of the U.S. Navy; Michael Shellenberger, a journalist and founder of Public news outlet; and Michael Gold, a former NASA official. All four agreed that the U.S. government is deliberately concealing information about UAPs. They suggested that certain UAPs could represent non-human intelligence and that the U.S. might possess advanced technologies that are not of this world.At a recent UAP hearing , Luis Elizondo, a key advocate for UAP transparency, firmly stated that ""UAPs are real"" and described how these phenomena, potentially linked to non-human intelligence, are monitoring sensitive military sites globally. He argued that the U.S. government has recovered UAP technologies, and other nations may possess them, while criticising the secrecy surrounding UAP programs.Retired Navy rear admiral Tim Gallaudet shared his 2015 encounter with a UAP during a naval exercise, highlighting the ""Go Fast"" video that showed an object exhibiting flight characteristics beyond known military technology. He emphasised that key UAP information is hidden in classified programs.Journalist Michael Shellenberger referred to comments by Presidents Trump and Obama, both suggesting the U.S. government holds undisclosed UAP information. He called for bipartisan transparency, arguing that the public has a right to know the truth, especially if UAPs pose a national security threat.Michael Gold, a former NASA official, highlighted the stigma that has long surrounded discussions of UAPs. He called on government agencies and the scientific community to overcome this stigma and open up to the possibility of scientific inquiry into the nature of UAPs. Gold echoed the famous phrase, “The truth is out there,” urging society to be brave enough to confront the possibility that humanity might not be alone in the universe.The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch, who had previously shared their experiences with UAPs.Graves, a former F/A-18 pilot, described multiple encounters with UAPs exhibiting advanced capabilities like supersonic speeds and the ability to hover in strong winds. He highlighted an incident in 2014 near Virginia Beach, where he and other pilots observed a mysterious object — a dark grey or black cube within a clear sphere — performing impossible manoeuvres. Graves raised concerns about underreporting and the withholding of critical information on these phenomena.David Grusch, a retired intelligence officer who had worked on the UAP task force, made explosive claims, stating that the U.S. government possessed crashed UAPs and potentially non-human biological material. Grusch revealed that he had interviewed over 40 witnesses and uncovered a multi-decade program focused on retrieving and reverse-engineering UAPs. He also suggested that some individuals had been harmed or threatened to suppress information on these technologies.Retired Navy Commander David Fravor recounted his famous 2004 encounter with a Tic-Tac-shaped UAP off the coast of California, which was later captured in Pentagon-released footage. Fravor described the UAP as having no visible flight controls and performing impossible manoeuvres, travelling at extreme speeds and defying the laws of physics. He emphasised that the object’s capabilities far surpassed anything the U.S. military currently possesses, suggesting it was not from any known nation.Fravor also emphasised that the technology witnessed in the Tic-Tac incident could represent a potential national security threat, given its capabilities far exceeded anything that the U.S. military possessed at the time. Fravor expressed awe at the object's performance but also voiced serious concerns about what it might mean for national security, warning that the technology involved could be far beyond anything the U.S. or its adversaries currently control.The testimonies of these whistleblowers, along with the release of the Immaculate Constellation report, have reignited public interest in UAPs and their potential implications for national security. While many of the questions surrounding these phenomena remain unanswered, the hearing underscored the growing demand for transparency and for the U.S. government to declassify critical data about UAPs. The revelations have set the stage for what could be a significant shift in our understanding of not just UAPs, but also the broader cosmic context in which humanity exists. The truth, as these whistleblowers have insisted, may well be out there—waiting to be uncovered.","The 2024 hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) built on earlier testimonies from military figures, including retired Navy pilot Ryan Graves and intelligence officer David Grusch.
