Wayanad landslide horror: Midnight run uphill into forest helps beat death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/midnight-run-uphill-into-forest-helps-beat-death/articleshow/112180917.cms,"KOCHI: As rains pounded the tiled roof of their small house located on the banks of Mundakkai river at Punchirivattom, just a kilometre from the landslide spot, Muhammed Basil, a 25-year-old software engineer, and his parents spent a nervous, sleepless night.Barely 10 minutes before the massive landslide on the hilltop in Mundakkai swept away hundreds of people and their houses early Tuesday, the family showed the presence of mind to quickly escape to the jungles and move up the hills.The decision saved the lives of Basil, his mother Suhara, 53 and his father Abdul Hameed, 57.""My house was situated on the upstream end of the river. The heavy rainfall in the region made it difficult for us to sleep. Around 12.30 am, we saw the river waters gradually rising and seeping into our home. We quickly decided to seek refuge at my uncle's house, which was just a hundred metres away from ours. However, within minutes of reaching there, we heard the deafening sound of gushing water, and that house also began to shake,"" said Basil.""The doors of my uncle's house were stuck as the entire house trembled, but we managed to crash it. Without wasting a breath, I took my mother and father outside, and we mustered all our strength to run up the hill and into the forest . Within seconds, the sudden gush of water, carrying huge boulders and trees, swept away our home and also our new two-storied house, which was in the finishing stage,"" Basil recounted the harrowing experience of that fateful night.After spending hours in the forest and traversing many routes, he and his parents took shelter at a nearby Tree Valley resort around 3am.Basil, who works in Kochi, had returned home weeks ago to oversee the completion of his new house, and was working from home. ""Due to the modest size of our dwelling, we were constantly at a risk of being inundated by floodwaters. Building a new, secure home has always been my dream. Now, the landslide has swept away everything, leaving only debris in its wake,"" he lamented. Nearly 30 of his relatives and neighbours perished in the tragedy. ""We don't know how to move forward and rebuild our lives,"" he said tearfully.Basil's father was a taxi driver and his mother was a daily wage worker.

BENGALURU: Scientists from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) have identified Ladakh as an ideal location for India's first Mars and Moon analogue research station . Their proposal leverages past research as well as their own field work experience.The research work, carried out by Binita Phartiyal from BSIP along with IISc’s Aloke Kumar and Shubhanshu Shukla — one of India’s four Gaganyaan astronauts — comes as India accelerates its ambitious space programme , including plans for a space station by 2035 and a Moon landing by 2040.An analogue research station, Kumar explained: “is a place where activities meant for Moon and Mars can be planned and practised. For example, if you’re planning an astronaut habitat, you can build a habitat there as there are some similarities (geological, for example) with extra-terrestrial conditions. You can also use it to see how microbes and other organisms respond to such extreme environments.”Phartiyal and Kumar, lead authors of the proposal, highlight Ladakh’s unique geographical features that closely resemble both Martian and Lunar environments. The region’s cold, arid desert landscape, rocky terrain, and geomorphological similarities to early Mars and the Moon make it an exceptional candidate for simulating extra-terrestrial conditions.“Ladakh offers a natural laboratory for testing equipment, training personnel, and conducting crucial scientific studies. Its environment provides geochemical, geomorphological, and astrobiological fidelity to Mars and Moon,” says Phartiyal.Phartiyal, who has been visiting Ladakh for research work nearly every year since 2000, has studied the landscape closely. “...Being there often makes me feel that you are on a different planet altogether,” Phartiyal, who also participated in Nasa’s Spaceward Bound India programme (2016), which cited Ladakh’s high altitude mountainous ecosystem possessing Mars-analogous topological features, said.The proposed research station would serve multiple purposes: Testing platform for space technologies, advancing Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), engineering integration, human studies and crew training and geological and astrobiological research.The establishment of such a facility would significantly boost India’s space programme, particularly the Indian human space programme and future Mars exploration plans. It would also provide valuable opportunities for studying extremophiles and conducting comparative research with samples from India’s existing polar research stations.“This is an opportune time for India to join the global community in establishing analogue research stations. It will not only benefit our space programme but also promote astro tourism and support local communities in Ladakh,” Kumar said.This proposal follows India’s recent milestone of inducting four astronaut designates into its ranks, underscoring its growing commitment to space exploration.“As India positions itself as a major player in the global space arena, the Ladakh analogue research station could prove to be a crucial step towards realising its extra-terrestrial ambitions, providing a vital resource for scientific research, technological development, and astronaut training in the years to come,” Kumar said.As reported earlier by TOI, Kumar pioneered the concept of creating space-bricks from biologically consolidated lunar and martian regolith and has an interest in developing extra-terrestrial habitats for human colonies.","Scientists from Indian Institute of Science have identified Ladakh as an ideal location for India's first Mars and Moon analogue research station.

While Centre levied 15% service tax, GST Council, the all-powerful ministerial panel chaired by finance minister, settled for 18% tax on insurance, which is seen to be burdensome by consumers. Several other services, such as telecom, attract the same levy.In all likelihood, the rationalisation rates, and possible merger of slabs, will see a reduction in levy although a removal of tax will result in those providing services to insurance firms being denied tax credits.A final call on the change in rates will only be taken up once a group of ministers led by Bihar deputy chief minister Samrat Chaudhary submits its report to the GST Council. After the last meeting of the GST council, Sitharaman had said that preliminary discussions may take place when ministers reassemble in Aug.

Quad Meeting in Tokyo: Quad Condemns China's South China Sea Tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-raps-china-for-scs-manoeuvres-backs-philippines/articleshow/112117977.cms,"China expectedly loomed over the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo Monday as India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s “dangerous manoeuvres” in the South China Sea ( SCS ) and called for an Indo-Pacific in which no country dominates and no country is dominated.In a first, India also joined others in upholding in a joint statement the 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing’s expansive claims over SCS waters in its maritime dispute with the Philippines as the basis for peacefully resolving such disputes.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his US, Australia and Japan counterparts - Antony Blinken, Penny Wong and Yoko Kamikawa respectively - called the award a significant milestone and.India had for the first time last year, in a joint statement with the Philippines, unambiguously asked China to adhere to the legally binding tribunal award Beijing has always called null and void. Before that India had restricted itself to only calling for respecting the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal was instituted.As they reassembled in Tokyo after the recent China-Philippines tensions, the ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and for this purpose, to enhance collaboration with regional partners. They also announced initiatives to enhance regional maritime domain awareness in the Pacific through satellite data, training and capacity building. “In line with such efforts, we intend to geographically expand the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) to the Indian Ocean region,” said the joint statement.The ministers also committed to soon having the 2024 Quad summit which PM Narendra Modi is now looking to host on the margins of the UNGA in New York in September, pending the availability of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida. Japan is yet to confirm because the date for ruling LDP election might clash with the General Assembly session, making it difficult for him to travel abroad.In his opening remarks, while talking about the need for Quad to uphold a rules-based order, Jaishankar said it’s only Quad collaboration that can ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains free, remains open, stable, secure and prosperous.“It is therefore essential that our political understanding strengthens, our economic partnerships grow, our technology collaborations expand and our people-to-people comfort intensifies. Our meeting should send a clear message, that the Quad is here to stay, here to do and here to go,” he addedIn their pushback against China, the Quad ministers backed sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also expressing commitment to address debt crises through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. They expressed serious concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas, reiterating their strong opposition to any unilateral action to change the status quo by force or coercion.“We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating manoeuvres in the South China Sea. We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous manoeuvres, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities,” said the joint statement.According to the ministers, Quad is also looking to contribute to the region through capacity building cooperation for enhancing maritime security. “We intend to launch a Quad Maritime Legal Dialogue under the Quad Maritime Security Working Group to focus our expertise on international law of the sea issues in support of our efforts to uphold the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific,” said the statement.","India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s ‘dangerous manoeuvres’ in the South China Sea ( SCS ) The ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112117994,imgsize-1556167,width-400,resizemode-4/112117994.jpg"
"'Sure sign of ... ': On Nitin Gadkari's letter to Sitharaman, Congress takes 'dissent' jibe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sure-sign-of-on-nitin-gadkaris-letter-to-sitharaman-congress-takes-dissent-jibe/articleshow/112175685.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday targeted the BJP over road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari 's letter to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , calling it a ""sure sign of internal dissent and rumblings"" against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his letter, Gadkari requested Sitharaman to withdraw the 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) on life and medical insurance premiums.Union minister Nitin Gadkari relayed the concerns of the Nagpur Division Life Insurance Corporation Employees Union, which had presented him a memorandum addressing issues in the insurance industry.Referring to the memo regarding issues in the insurance industry, road transport and highway minister said, ""Levying GST on life insurance premiums amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life. The Union feels that the person who covers the risk of life's uncertainties to protect their family should not be taxed on the premiums paid to purchase this cover.""Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh responded on X, sharing Gadkari's letter as indicative of dissent within the government. Ramesh said, ""Mr. Nitin Jairam Gadkari's letter to the FM on the Budget is a sure sign of internal dissent and rumblings against the non-biological PM.""In his letter, Gadkari elaborated on the issues raised by the union, focusing on the GST withdrawal for life and medical insurance premiums. He also mentioned concerns over differential treatment of savings through life insurance, the re-introduction of income tax deductions for health insurance premiums, and the consolidation of public sector general insurance companies.Both life insurance and medical insurance premiums currently face an 18 percent GST rate, a point of contention highlighted by the union and addressed by Gadkari in his request to the finance minister.Meanwhile, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram also took a jab at the BJP, expressing approval that Gadkari had called on the finance minister to remove the GST on insurance.

By levying GST you are making the premiums expensive. You must treat insurance not only as a social cover but also as a mode of saving.

Retrospective royalty on minerals will ruin economy: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retrospective-royalty-on-minerals-will-ruin-economy-government/articleshow/112179501.cms,"Mining levy trial pits BJP-led Odisha, TDP's AP against Centre

Ripples will be felt from nanotech to healthcare: Attorney general

NEW DELHI: Pleading with the Supreme Court for prospective implementation of its nine-judge bench ruling allowing states to levy royalty on extracted minerals and tax on mineral-bearing lands, the Union government on Wednesday said retrospective application would create a burden humongous enough to ruin many PSUs and industries, dent the larger economy and send prices of almost every product soaring.The hearing in Supreme Court on Wednesday on whether the court's verdict allowing states to collect royalty on minerals extracted from their jurisdiction as well as tax on mineral-bearing tracts could be applied retrospectively saw BJP-governed Odisha, partner TDP-led Andhra Pradesh and some local bodies diverging from the stand of the BJP-led central coalition.The Chandrababu Naidu government opposed the Centre's fervent plea for prospective implementation of a nine-judge SC bench's ruling empowering states to levy royalty and tax on minerals, which has been unpaid for the last 35 years and could run into lakhs of crores of rupees.The difference was palpable before a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, B V Nagarathna, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, S C Sharma and A G Masih which is deciding whether its July 25 judgment granting states the right to levy royalty on extracted minerals and tax on mineral-bearing land should operate prospectively, or retrospectively.As states were not able to realise these levies for 35 years, since the 1989 judgment in India Cement case, the cumulative arrears on these two levies run into lakhs of crores of rupees. The Centre pleaded for prospective implementation citing huge financial impact on the economy, industries and PSUs. SG Tushar Mehta said ultimately, the burden would be passed on by industries to the people, who would bear brunt of price rise.The Andhra Pradesh government, however, opposed the Centre's plea and said the HC had upheld the validity of an AP legislation imposing such levies in 2005 and the SC had only stayed operation of the law, which meant it was alive even if inoperative. After the nine-judge bench ruling, the state law came into effect from the day it was enacted, and the state had a right to recover arrears, AP's counsel said.Attorney general R Venkataramani told a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, A S Oka, B V Nagarathna, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, S C Sharma and A G Masih, “There will be multi-polar impact on the economy and industries, which is not visible to the court today. If mining sector gets impacted, ripples will be felt from nanotechnology to healthcare.” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta elaborated on the adverse impact of retrospective implementation of the constitution bench ruling to enable states to recover the arrears of royalty and tax, which had been on hold since 1989 when the SC, in a 7-1 ruling in the India Cement case, said states had no right to levy royalty on extracted minerals or tax on mineral-bearing land.Supported by various sectors of industries represented by senior advocates Harish Salve, A M Singhvi and Arvind Datar, the SG said, “In India, 55% of the total commercial energy production is coal reliant, and 68% coal production is used in the generation of electricity. Power is not only an essential input across every other industrial sector but also meets the daily energy requirements of domestic and rural consumers.The Centre said as per a preliminary estimate, retrospective application of the verdict would mean a cumulative burden of Rs 70,000 crore on PSUs engaged in energy production and mining.","BJP-governed Odisha, partner TDP-led Andhra Pradesh and some local bodies diverging from the stand of the BJP-led central coalition.

Radha Devi at the old age should not be denied the 'status of spouse', which entitles her to receive family pension. This would help her live with dignity and help her financially.

There has been widespread disappointment, in spite of the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister and others to talk up the Budget and its so-called accomplishments,"" Sonia said.""The Union government, especially its top leadership, continues to be self-delusional as crores of families across the country are devastated by mounting unemployment and price rise,"" she added.On the issue of caste census, Sonia Gandhi criticized the government's lack of intention to conduct the census, which was last due in 2021. She pointed out that this would prevent an up-to-date estimate of the population, especially of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, and deny benefits to at least 12 crore citizens under the National Food Security Act of 2013.""It is clear that the government has no intention whatsoever to conduct the Census that was last due in 2021. This will prevent us from having an up-to-date estimate of the population of the country, especially of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. It also means that at least 12 crore of our citizens are denied the benefit of the National Food Security Act of 2013 – now repackaged as PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana,"" Sonia Gandhi said.Sonia Gandhi accused the government of dividing communities and spreading fear and animosity.""We would have hoped that the Modi Government would draw the right lessons from their significant decline in the Lok Sabha elections. Instead, they are persisting with their policy of dividing communities and spreading an atmosphere of fear and animosity. Fortunately, the Supreme Court intervened at the right time. But this can only be a temporary respite. Look at how the rules have been suddenly changed to permit the bureaucracy to participate in the activities of the RSS. It calls itself a cultural organization but the whole world knows that it is the BJP’s political and ideological base,"" Sonia said.She also raised concerns about the exposure of flaws in competitive examinations and the erosion of autonomy in educational organizations like NCERT, UGC, and constitutional bodies like UPSC.""Education has been amongst the worst casualties in the past years. Instead of taking the nation forward, the entire educational system is being shown up as flawed and manipulated. The exposure of how competitive examinations have been allowed has destroyed the faith of lakhs of youth and dealt their future a body blow. The professional character and autonomy of organizations like the NCERT, UGC and even of Constitutional bodies like the UPSC has been all-but-destroyed,"" she said.On national security, Sonia Gandhi highlighted the recent terror attacks in the Jammu and Kashmir, questioning the government's claims of normalcy in the region. She also criticized the Prime Minister for not visiting Manipur to address the ongoing crisis.Sonia Gandhi says, ""There is deeply disturbing news in national security issues. Over the past few weeks, there have been at least eleven terror attacks in the Jammu region alone. There have been similar attacks in the Valley as well. Security personnel and a large number of civilians have lost their lives. This makes a mockery of the claims being made by the Modi Government is all in well in J&K. The situation in Manipur shows no sign of any improvement. The Prime Minister travels the world over, but steadfastly refuses to go to the state and take the initiative to bring about normalcy.""Sonia Gandhi urged party workers to sustain the momentum generated in the Lok Sabha elections and work unitedly with a sense of purpose in the upcoming state elections. She emphasized that a strong performance could lead to a transformation in national politics.""In a few months, elections will be held in four states. We must sustain the momentum and goodwill that had been generated for us in the Lok Sabha elections. We must not become complacent and over-confident. The ‘mahaul’ does favour us, but we have to work unitedly with a sense of purpose. I dare say that if we perform well, reflecting the trend that we witnessed in the Lok Sabha elections, national politics will undergo a transformation,"" Sonia told party workers.","Congress parliamentary chairperson Sonia Gandhi targeted the government on handling of various issues. Former Congress chief accused the government of being ""self-delusional"" and failing to learn from their ""decline"" in the Lok Sabha polls. She also highlighted the loss of lives due to railway accidents caused by mismanagement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112157138,imgsize-558043,width-400,resizemode-4/112157138.jpg"

The Mughals' ability to maintain composure despite donning bulky traditional attire and carrying out household chores is something that is rarely discussed, except from their breathtakingly beautiful palaces, graceful dance as depicted in movies, or heartfelt hymns chanted in Allah's honour. But how did the Mughals survive without air conditioning? How did they build cooling architecture? That is the question.In the 21st century.It's as if we continually shatter our own records of hottest days alive. July 22 was the hottest day with the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth. A deadly heat wave across the world and malfunctioning air conditioners claimed many people's lives for a while.Air conditioning in buildings indicates considerable energy use and utility expenditures. Today, while we are developing sustainable heating and cooling technologies to comply with the green construction movement, it is important to note that ecological heating and cooling techniques have been employed for as long as humans have been building homes. Mughal architecture in India provides unique active and passive air conditioning technologies that can be easily incorporated into contemporary buildings.The Mughals employed two elements to regulate the weather around the structure: flora and water. These waterways and fountains were frequently extended into the interiors of structures. The Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element. Large reflecting pools and water channels, referred to as ""rills,"" were frequently included into the architecture of structures and landscapes.Through evaporation, these water elements not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal but also helped to cool the air. The pools' reflecting surfaces also assisted in deflecting sunlight from the structures, which lessened their ability to absorb heat.One common element of Mughal design was jharokhas, or overhanging enclosed balconies. These buildings promoted natural ventilation in addition to their aesthetic appeal. Jharokhas were positioned strategically to allow air to move throughout the building, limiting direct sunlight and offering shade while also facilitating a steady supply of fresh air.Huge courtyards and verdant gardens were frequently incorporated into the architectural designs of Mughal structures. The environment was significantly cooled by these open areas. Cooler air might flow within the buildings and hot air could exit through the courtyards. Gardens, which frequently have pools and other water elements, produced a microclimate that considerably lowered the temperature.The Mughals also employed inventive cooling methods like terraces and roof gardens. By acting as insulation, these raised gardens assisted in lowering the amount of heat that the roofs absorbed. Through transpiration, the flora on the roof gardens had a cooling effect that improved the comfort of the interior spaces below.Buildings with thick walls and lofty ceilings were among the Mughals' most simple yet effective strategies. As insulators, the thick walls limited the amount of heat that could enter from the outside, keeping the interiors cold. The living areas below were significantly cooler due to the hot air rising to the high ceilings. This type of architecture was especially common in palaces and huge public structures.Large domes and chhatris, or elevated dome-shaped pavilions, were useful features in Mughal design in addition to being decorative. These buildings promoted air movement and offered shade. Because of their high ceilings, the domes assisted in keeping the lower rooms cooler by retaining hot air and letting it to leave through ventilation at the top.Mughal architecture was distinguished by its finely carved jaali screens. Similar to contemporary blinds, these perforated stone screens allowed air to travel through while obstructing direct sunlight, producing a cooling effect. The jaali screens made sure the interiors stayed pleasant even on the warmest days by dispersing sunlight and lowering heat buildup.Mughal buildings were orientated with great care to maximise shade and reduce heat gain. Structures were frequently orientated to benefit from the dominant winds, which improved natural ventilation. Living areas were kept cool and shaded by the use of covered pathways and verandas.","Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element.

NEW DELHI: Registering a marginal increase in top scorers, 22,920 candidates scored full marks across 45 subjects in the Common University Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( CUET-UG 2024), the gateway to undergraduate courses across 283 universities in India.However, this year, as earlier announced by National Testing Agency, these top scorers scored perfect 200, while in 2022 and 2023 the agency accorded percentile scores as the papers were conducted in multiple sessions and normalisation method was employed.Bringing relief to lakhs of aspirants, NTA announced the results on Sunday evening. Of the 63 subjects, 200 is the maximum marks for 62 and the General Test paper is of 250 marks.The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520).In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200. Of the 8.2 lakh candidates who took the English test, 1,683 scored 200.Sanskrit and Punjabi were the other two languages where over 50 candidates had perfect scores. A total of 22,836 aspirants scored 100 percentile in 2023 and 21,159 scored 100 percentile in 2022.Though the number of perfect scorers increased marginally from the number of 100 percentile scorers in 2023, the competition for select programmes like commerce is set to get tougher in popular universities like Delhi University (DU). The number of aspirants scoring 100 percentile in Busi- ness Studies was 2,357 in 2023, which has increased to 8,024 this year. However, for sought after honour programmes like economics/business econom- ics, there is likely to be a de- crease in minimum eligible marks as the number of high scorers have come down by 454% from last year. Among the 8,000-plus perfect scorers in Business Studies is Khusali Nahataa from Delhi, who aspires for admission in Shri Ram College of Commerce or Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University.A student of Modern School, Barakhambha Road, she said, “I chose to study BS with a lot of mind maps and charts. I’m aiming for SRCC or LSR. I did not take any coaching and did 8-10 hours of self-study every day.” Anjali Jyoti, a student of DAV Noida, Sector 56, scored 200/200 in three (Geography, Political Science and Psychol- ogy) of the five subjects she appeared. she said, “I want to pursue BA (Political Science H) from one of the best colleg- es of DU. I relied entirely on self-study as maximum syl- labus was from Class 12 so there was no need for extra sources or coaching. Only the deleted portion needed to be covered separately.”On July 7, NTA had released provisional answer keys of CUET-UG 2024. A retest for over 1,000 candidates whose grievances were found genuine by the agency was conducted on July 19. The delay in CUET-UG results comes amid a row over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including in NEET-UG and UGC-NET.Originally, CUET results were scheduled to be released on June 30 but NTA delayed it, grappling with paper leak allegations involving NEETUG, UGC-NET and CSIRUGC-NET. CUET-UG, conducted in hybrid mode for the first time across the country, was cancelled in Delhi a night before the scheduled exam over “logistical reasons”. The exam was conducted in the national capital later.NTA had earlier an- nounced that the third edition of CUET-UG would be com- pleted in seven days and there would be no normalisation of scores as all exams would be conducted in a single shift.For 15 subjects, the tests were in pen-paper mode and for the other 48, the exam was held in CBT mode. Over 13.4 lakh candidates registered for the test for admission to undergraduate courses in 261 central, state, deemed and private universities this year.In the first edition of the exam in 2022, the test was plagued by technical glitches. Also, as a result of tests for a subject being conducted over multiple shifts, the scores had to be normalised during announcement of results.","The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520) In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200.

World's richest woman whose wealth surpasses modern tycoons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/worlds-richest-woman-whose-wealth-surpasses-modern-tycoons/articleshow/112078972.cms,"How Wu Zetian became empress Wu?



Natasa Stankovic Gets Trolled For Sharing Videos of Her Happy Moments with Son in Serbia

When you picture the world's richest people in the world, the names of Mukesh Ambani, Elon Musk, Jess Bezos, Bernard Arnault & family, and Mark Zuckerberg come to the mind. But long before, any of them existed a powerful Chinese Empress Wu Zetian of Tang dynasty , boasted of wealth of around 16 trillion USD , which could overshadow combined net worth of the wealthiest people across the globe.During the 2000 year of dynastic rule in China, there were more than 600 emperors but amongst them all only one female emperor. Wu Zetian, the only female emperor to rule China, was born in 624 BC and ruled the Tang dynasty between 665 to 705 BC. Zetian, however, was married at the age of 14 but with her intelligence and skills quickly rose to the position of secretary to Emperor Taizong. After the death of the emperor she was made senior concubine- by acquainting Tazong's son- Gaozong. And after his death too- no one was left to question the sole authority of Empress Wu.Emperess Wu Zetian was someone whose political prowess is comparable to notable women, like Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, and Catherine the Great. Popularly known as Empress Wu, the richest-ever female monarch accumulated the unfathomable fortune, with her astute vision, shrewd techniques, and brutal decisions, that also included killing of her own children, it is said. While she was hailed for some of her decisions like reducing the taxes on peasants that helps in increasing agricultural productivity and thus state revenue, she also took some controversial decisions. The controversy surrounding her life was definitely exaggerated by historians who were prejudiced towards woman with strong ambitions. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence of her cruelty towards the rich and affluent. She also was particularly ruthless towards her enemies real or imagined.As per one of the accounts, her power hunger and paranoia led her to kill one of her own children - her daughter - and depose her sons who were emperors before her. She, however, helped expand the Chinese empire significantly in the 15 years of her reign from 690 C.E. to 705 C.E.Wu Zetian was born in a wealthy family to a timber merchant in 624 AD in Shanxi province. Her father was close to Li Yuan, who eventually ascended to become Emperor Gaozong of Tang and this gave her an opportunity to forge close connections with the royal household.Empress Wu was deeply passionate about literature from a very early age and at the age of 14, she was appointed as a secretary in the Tang Palace, getting an opportunity to work under Emperor Taizong.Subsequently, the emperor's death led her to a Buddhist monastery which was a common practice for all the women associated with the emperor during that time. However her affair with Emperor Gaozong, the deceased emperor’s son and successor, once against brought an unexpected twist in her journey as she once again made her way back to the palace as a concubine.With her cunning ways, she soon ousted Empress Wang and ascended to the throne as an empress in the year 655. A major turning point for her was when Emperor Gaozong entrusted the empress with the governance of his empire after his health took a turn for the worse and he started having debilitating migraine-like headaches and vision loss.Thus, started a historic reign that made her the first and only woman to rule China. Well-educated, visionary, and an excellent public speaker, Empress Wu is credited with a number of welfare measures that also boosted trade like reducing taxation to re-opening of silk road to trade.Did you like this article?

NEW DELHI: A ransomware attack has forced the temporary shutdown of payment systems across nearly 300 small Indian local banks, according to reports. The customers of these banks have not been able to access payments services like withdrawing cash at ATMs or using UPI.The ransomware attack affected C-Edge Technologies , a provider of banking technology systems to small banks across the country, reports said.Other banking services are functioning normally, the officials told PTI.In a statement released late in the evening, the national payments corporation of India (NPCI) said, ""C-Edge Technologies….has been possibly impacted by a ransomware attack impacting a few of their systems,"" leading to the temporary isolation of C-Edge from accessing NPCI-operated retail payment systems.Dileep Sanghani, chairman of the national cooperative union of India, told news agency PTI that nearly 300 banks in India, including 17 district cooperative banks in Gujarat, which rely on C-Edge, have been facing issues for the past two to three days.""All online transactions, such as RTGS and UPI payments, are affected. Money is deducted from the sender's account but does not get credited in the receiver's account,"" Sanghani said.""Customers of banks serviced by C-Edge will not be able to access payment systems during the period of isolation,"" the NPCI told news agency Reuters.The statement also mentioned that restoration work is being carried out rapidly in collaboration with C-Edge Technologies, and a mandatory security review is underway.C-Edge, a joint venture between SBI and TCS, serves cooperative banks and regional rural banks, which have been affected by the breach. Officials stated that other banking services remained unaffected.

The Fed's decision to keep the benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range was widely anticipated, but the central bank's openness to easing in September, just seven weeks before the November US elections, was noteworthy.

AHMEDABAD: With rise in profitability, Gujarat's corporates have significantly increased their spending on corporate social responsibility (CSR).The state's CSR spending reached a five-year high of Rs 2,008.42 crore in 2022-23, marking a 25.1% increase from the previous year's Rs 1,604.26 crore, reports the Union ministry of corporate affairs. Gujarat's CSR expenditure ranks second in India, trailing only Maharashtra 's Rs 5,497.32 crore.CSR experts attribute this growth to the substantial number of large industries setting up and expanding in Gujarat over the past decade. Many of them have been profitable in recent years, with increasing volumes year after year. The strong presence of large companies, along with that of MSMEs, has driven the trend of increased spending.Pankaj Kamliya, chief operations officer at Gujarat CSR Authority, said, ""Better awareness among industries, a responsible governance structure, and dedicated CSR project implementation teams have led to a substantial rise in CSR spending. The increasing sense of responsibility among corporates towards social impact and community uplift is evident. With growing businesses, overall spending has also risen.""At the national level, the healthcare sector attracted the highest funding through CSR for two consecutive years, i.e., in 2020-21 (Rs 7,325 crore) and 2021-22 (Rs 7,816 crore). In both these years, the education sector drew funds worth Rs 6,693.25 crore and Rs 6,569.82 crore, respectively.However, in 2022-23, the focus of corporate spending seems to have shifted back to the education sector. During the year, the highest CSR fund of Rs 10,085.78 crore was allocated to projects in the education sector, a rise of 53.5% against 2021-22, followed by the healthcare sector, which drew Rs 6,830.6 crore of funding.According to CSR experts, the trend of corporate spending in projects is pretty much the same in Gujarat as well.""Between FY 2020 and FY 2022, we saw a spike in CSR funding towards healthcare interventions, which was primarily driven by the COVID response. Now, as things have moved back to normalcy from the last financial year, we will see the CSR fund shifting back to the pre-Covid time ratio largely,"" explained Bhomik Shah, founder and CEO, CSRBOX, a boutique CSR solutions organization.According to CSRBOX, education and skilling combined get 36%, and healthcare, wash, and allied areas get 31% of CSR funds, based on unique project profiling.Industry experts also observed a marked change with a substantial increase in the spending towards environment projects among Gujarat-based corporates and those across India.""The increase in CSR spend towards environmental projects is driven by increasing demand in corporate boardrooms for ESG performance improvement and investing in climate resilience projects. We expect that spending on environmental projects will be in double-digit percentage in the next financial year,"" Shah adds.He also explained there is substantial interest of corporates in entrepreneurship and employability programmes among the CSR funders in the last two years, and the trend continues in this financial year as well.","Gujarat's CSR spending reached a five-year high of Rs 2,008.42 crore in 2022-23.

GURGAON: Residents have raised concerns about the dilapidated condition of a stretch of the key Rampura-Pataudi Road near Bestech Ananda in Sector 81 .The 120m stretch has numerous potholes and uneven surfaces, making it difficult for commuters to navigate safely on the stretch.This has led to several accidents and frequent traffic jams in the area, residents said.Though redevelopment of the 5.6km road - which links new sectors to NH-8 - began in Feb 2022 with an Aug 2023 deadline, GMDA has not been able to revamp the road as planned, missing several deadlines.Officials have cited ongoing litigation as one of the main reasons for the delay.Delays in acquisition of two stretches of 100 metres and 120 metres, along with the removal of a temple structure, have hindered progress, they said.The redevelopment project, estimated to cost Rs 66 crore, aims to widen the existing four-lane road into a six-lane main carriageway.The design includes service roads, cycle tracks, footpaths, and green areas, promising enhanced traffic flow and safety for commuters and residents.Residents criticised GMDA's ""indifferent attitude"". ""For us, commuting is a struggle every day. Due to the rains, several potholes have formed on the road, which are not just causing inconvenience but pose a serious safety hazard too. Those on two-wheelers are the worst affected. Several accidents have been reported here. When will GMDA wake up from its deep slumber?"" questioned Kumar Ashok, president of Bestech Grand Spa RWA.Dharamvir Singh, president of Mapsko Casabella RWA, urged the authorities to work together to find a solution. ""If there are problems, officials need to resolve them and provide some relief. The GMDA is shirking its responsibility by blaming litigation.""GMDA chief engineer Arun Dhankar said two patches on the main carriageway are under litigation.""A depression has formed near Sector 81, leading to water accumulation and deterioration of the road,"" he said. Asked about completion of the project, he said: ""Besides pending litigation, we will take action on the encroachments hindering the progress of the project. We will also take the issue up with the departments concerned.""","Residents have raised concerns about the dilapidated condition of a stretch of the key Rampura-Pataudi Road in Sector 81.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
