India Meteorological Department: India’s weather forecasting to face long-term impact of US move to downsize NOAA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-weather-forecasting-to-face-long-term-impact-of-us-move-to-downsize-noaa/articleshow/120422657.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: India Meteorological Department ’s (IMD) concerns intensified with the American Meteorological Society (AMS) releasing a formal statement late Thursday, highlighting the Trump administration ’s plan to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research through fund cuts that will result in the closure of all its weather, climate, and ocean laboratories, as well as cooperative institutes.The NOAA presently shares data with several countries, including India, which helps improve weather forecast accuracy. Although the US govt’s proposed move may not immediately impact India, it will affect the IMD’s forecasting skill in the long run.NOAA significantly contributes to the observing system in oceans, including the Indian and Pacific Oceans, which helps IMD in weather forecasting , disaster preparedness and climatic research.Both NOAA and India’s ministry of earth sciences (MoES) have a joint oceanographic data portal, launched in 2021. The collaboration under partnership agreement between the two agencies also helps in studying the Indian Ocean’s role in monsoon and improving monsoon forecasts .Asked about the impact of the proposed move, M Ravichandran, secretary, MoES, while releasing monsoon forecast early this week, said that India’s forecasting ability would remain unaffected in the short term but there might be consequences later.“If there is a cut in manpower, we do not have any problem. There is no problem even if the model is not there. The only thing is that they are significantly contributing to the observing system, especially in the ocean, be it the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean. If that is reduced, our forecasting skill will be reduced,” he said.Noting that the clue for monsoon forecasts comes from the ocean, the secretary said, “If we do not have proper ocean observations , we will definitely not be able to have better predictability”.The AMS statement came in partnership with the National Weather Association of the US that connects approximately 1,300 members from the fields of meteorology, hydrology, emergency management and academia.","The American Meteorological Society (AMS) released a formal statement late Thursday, highlighting the Trump administration ’s plan to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research.

'Half of student visas US revoked are of Indians',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-student-visas-us-revoked-are-of-indians/articleshow/120421897.cms,"Representative Image

The US state department and Immigration & Customs Enforcement continue to aggressively target international students with visa revocations, termination of their legal status, and removal. With Indians constituting the largest cohort of international students, it isn't surprising that the majority of those impacted are from India.The American Immigration Lawyers Association collected 327 reports of visa revocations and SEVIS terminations from attorneys, students, and university employees and found that 50% of these international students were from India, followed by 14% from China.Other significant countries represented in this data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.“These reports paint aconcerning picture of the arbitrary nature of these visa revocations and terminations,” it states in its policy brief.As per an Open Doors Report for the academic year 2023-24, India sent over 3.3 lakh students to pursue higher education in the US — an increase of 23% over the previous year. China was the second leading place of origin with almost 2.8 lakh students —this was a slight decline of 4% over the previous year. Anecdotal evidence shows that the number of Indian students aspiring to study in US is dipping sharply.However, even as the crackdown on international students continues, several hundred students have filed lawsuits in US district courts challenging arbitrary termination of their legal status. Several courts have also granted ‘temporary restraining orders’, enabling students to continue their study in US.Referring to AILA’s policy brief, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh posted on X: “A press statement issued yesterday by the American Immigration Lawyers Association is cause for concern to us in India. Out of the 327 visa revocation cases of international students collected by the organisation so far, 50% are Indians. The reasons for revocation are random and unclear. There is growing fear and apprehension. Will the external affairs minister take note and raise the concern with his US counterpart?” He also tagged foreign minister S Jaishankar.“We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the American govt regarding their F-1 visa status, which happens to be the student visa. We are looking into the matter. Our embassy and consulates are in touch with the students to provide support,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at a weekly press briefing.International students on completion of their studies are allowed to gain work experience under the optional practical training program for a year — this is further extended by two years from students hailing from the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field. According to the Open Doors Report, over 97,000 students undergoing OPT post completion of their studies were from India, whereas Chinese students pursuing OPT stood at around 61,000.AILA’s policy brief points out that 50% of the impacted students were on OPT. “These individuals are unable to work immediately upon the termination of their SEVIS record. The road to reinstating status for those who have already graduated and are employed on OPT is much more difficult and murkier than those who are currently students,” it stated.The grounds on which action was taken against international students were arbitrary. In some cases international students found their SEVIS records were terminated and/or visas revoked owing to a criminal record — and they did not have a history of interaction with police and there was nothing in their record that would prompt a visa revocation.Students who encountered police for infractions are instances which most US citizens would consider a daily occurrence. These included not wearing a seatbelt, tickets for illegal parking, or speeding tickets and did not warrant visa revocation and/or SEVIS termination , states AILA.There was no uniformity in the issue of notices of SEVIS termination. There were many cases where there was a delay between the SEVIS termination and when the student was informed. This is risky because if students kept working without knowing their SEVIS was terminated, it could affect their immigration status, states AILA’s policy brief.","The US state department and Immigration & Customs Enforcement continue to aggressively target international students. 50% of these international students were from India, followed by 14% from China.

Assure accused will not go to Tihar: UK extradition authority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assure-accused-will-not-go-to-tihar-uk-extradition-authority/articleshow/120421791.cms,"Tihar Jail

NEW DELHI: The deputy chief crown prosecutor who oversees extraditions from the UK has advised India to provide sovereign guarantee that any accused being sought to be extradited to New Delhi will not be kept in Tihar Jail, or subjected to torture and inhuman treatment in prison, reports Pradeep Thakur.The advice comes after two back-to-back rejections of extradition requests by UK courts, the last one on Apr 11 of Virkiran Awasty and his wife Ritika who are wanted in India in connection with an alleged Rs 750 crore bank fraud case. On Feb 27, the UK high court had rejected alleged arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari’s extradition while also refusing India permission to appeal in UK Supreme Court against its verdict.“...The Bhandari ruling will likewise affect other cases we are conducting which involve detention in Tihar Jail, namely the (Awasty) ‘Hassad Fraud’ case...” the prosecutor said in a communication to the Indian govt.Subject to what I set out below, all these cases will inevitably fail and further legal activity on them is futile,” the deputy chief crown prosecutor wrote.The prosecutor, who is supposed to help India with its extradition requests, told the govt it has to immediately assure UK courts in writing that no accused will run afoul of Article 3 of ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights), which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment of prisoners. In rejecting Bhandari’s extradition, the court had concluded “a real risk of Article 3 mistreatment in Tihar Jail and a generalised risk of torture during interrogation”.The deputy chief crown prosecutor said that pending an assurance, “there is no prospect of a successful appeal in this case”, referring to the rejection of the Awastys’ extradition plea and further prospects of rejection of an appeal before higher courts in the UK.“I have to stress in the strongest possible terms that the only prospect left to us to salvage the case against Mr and Mrs Awasty is the urgent provision of an unequivocal assurance from the GoI. This has been discussed in various and repeated advice and conferences but has so far not been forthcoming,” the deputy chief crown prosecutor said.The assurance pertains to the govt giving an undertaking that the accused “will not be detained in Tihar Jail, either on remand or if and when convicted; if they are to be detained on remand or upon conviction, then the detention conditions will comply with Article 3”.The deputy chief crown prosecutor said if govt failed to give these undertakings, it would “not pursue any appeal” not only in the Awasty case but also in others even if there was merit in filing an appeal.A senior district judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London had on April 11 discharged the case of Awasty “on the grounds that, firstly and because he could not be satisfied Awasty’s Art 3 ECHR rights would not be violated in the event he was detained in Tihar Jail”. The other reason cited by the judge was “insufficient evidence for a prima facie case and for abuse of process based on the two-year delay in submitting the case following its earlier discharge”.The Crown Prosecution Service said it was ready to appeal against the verdict but as per existing conditions, it was difficult to assure a favourable outcome.“As far as the Article 3 grounds are concerned, based on the papers and the latest correspondence we have received from the govt of India, I advise now that there is no prospect of a successful appeal in this case. Further, if that remains the case, the Crown Prosecution Service will not be able to lodge the necessary grounds of appeal to sustain the appeal and accordingly Awasty will be discharged, bringing the case to an end,” it said.",Advice comes after two back-to-back rejections of extradition requests by UK courts. Virkiran Awasty and his wife Ritika are wanted in India in connection with an alleged Rs 750 crore bank fraud case.

Saddened and surprised: Kapil Sibal

NEW DELHI: Opposition leaders have strongly criticised Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar ’s recent comments targeting the Supreme Court, accusing him of undermining the judiciary and violating constitutional norms. Dhankhar had questioned the Supreme Court’s authority under Article 142 and criticised its verdict setting timelines for presidential assent to bills, sparking sharp reactions from opposition leaders.""Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces available to judiciary 24x7. We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3). There it has to be five judges when Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 odd more,"" Dhankhar had said.Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala expressed his deep disagreement with the Vice President's position, despite acknowledging Dhankhar's experience and intellect. He said the Supreme Court’s verdict was “timely, courageous and correct,” and clarified that even high offices such as the President or Governors are not immune to constitutional checks.“In our democracy, only the Constitution of India is supreme,” Surjewala said, adding, “Judicial independence is indeed a ‘nuclear missile’—to strike down injustice, arbitrariness and misuse of power.” He argued that if the President or Governors were allowed unchecked authority, it would render elected legislatures powerless. “The Constitution would never confer such unbridled powers,” he warned.Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee launched a scathing attack, accusing the Vice President of repeatedly making derogatory remarks about the judiciary. “This is not expected from someone holding a constitutional position,” he said.Banerjee demanded Dhankhar’s resignation, stating, “He does not deserve to remain in the post of Vice President of India. He cannot attack one of the pillars of our democracy.” His remarks came in response to Dhankhar calling Article 142 a “nuclear missile against democratic forces,” while questioning the Supreme Court’s power to direct the President.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Kumar Jha urged for a more balanced and sensitive approach among all institutions of democracy. ""Whether it is the executive, legislature, judiciary, or media, there has to be a fine balance,"" he said.Jha stressed the need for constructive engagement instead of conflict. “We are in an era of politics where we need to think with sensitivity,” he said, cautioning against confrontations that could damage institutional integrity.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva slammed Dhankhar’s comments as “unethical,” asserting that they violate the principle of separation of powers.“When all three branches act within their own spheres, we must remember that the Constitution is supreme,” Siva said. He backed the Supreme Court’s ruling, which set timelines for presidential assent, as a step towards protecting legislative authority from indefinite delays. “No constitutional authority can override bills passed by elected legislatures,” he added.Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Kapil Sibal also criticised comments on the judiciary, expressing disappointment and questioning his understanding of constitutional principles. Sibal said he was “saddened and surprised” by Dhankhar’s remarks, particularly the comparison of Article 142 to a “nuclear missile.”He defended the judiciary as one of the most trusted institutions and accused the government of selectively accepting court rulings based on political convenience. Sibal clarified that Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to ensure complete justice and stressed that the President is a titular head who acts solely on the advice of the Cabinet. He warned against distorting this framework and criticised the Vice President for questioning the court’s composition in key verdicts.Responding to Union ministers who echoed Dhankhar’s concerns, Sibal said the bench size is determined by the Court itself and must be respected. He also raised concerns over attempts to undermine the judiciary’s role.","Opposition leaders have strongly criticised Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar ’s recent comments targeting the Supreme Court.

DGCA orders probe into Air India Express captain Armaan's death at Delhi Airport

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered a thorough investigation into the death of Air India Express First Officer Armaan's death who had collapsed after safely landing a Srinagar-Delhi flight last Wednesday. In his order, DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai has said that the probe team will take into account factors like the deceased pilot's medical history; whether any protocol needs to be devised for crew with such medical conditions and the time taken at Delhi Airport in providing the pilot the required care and the quality of the same.The probe panel comprising of Vishal Yadav, DGCA's deputy director air safety as investigator-in-charge, and Group Captain Murtaza, DMS (CA) subject matter expert as a member, has been asked to submit its report ""preferably"" within six months.Kidwai has asked the team to examine these points, among any other that the investigation throws up: ""Whether the crew reported about sickness to air traffic control (ATC) while in air and if so, whether ATC initiated action appropriately; check the medical history of the deceased crew; whether due precaution was taken during rostering of such crew who has flying restriction due to medical reasons.""""(Whether) any specific medical checks are required for such pilots to undergo before undertaking the flights; whether remaining onboard crew took action when crew reported feeling unwell; time taken in taking him to the medical centre at the airport/civil hospital; check the level of preparedness of the medical centre at the airport in handling such emergencies,' the probe panel has been asked to examine these areas too and also ""examine the existing guidelines / circulars in this regard and suggest changes if needed.""First officer Armaan, 35, had suffered a ""sudden cardiac arrest"" while operating flight IX-1153 from Srinagar to Delhi on April 9, 2025. After safely landing in Delhi, he went to the aircraft lavatory where he vomited. He collapsed in the forward galley and was taken to the airport medical centre by cabin crew and ground staff. He was then taken to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj but could not be saved.Armaan, who went by his first name only, had joined Air India Express in 2023 from SpiceJet. He had flown for less than 12 hours in the last seven days, it is learnt.Following his death, the Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) had said in a statement there’s an urgent need to put in place transparent regulations that prioritise rest for pilots, safety and humane scheduling practices. The association, which represents over 800 pilots of various Indian carriers, has stressed the need for having comprehensive mental health support systems within airline organisations and not merely as checkboxes but as active, accessible, and stigma-free services. ALPA says the untimely death of Captain Armaan’s death raises troubling questions about pilot welfare, mental health, and working conditions in the Indian aviation industry.While not linking Armaan’s tragic death to fatigue, several pilots say they have for a long time been pleading for less strenuous working conditions in India. After a significant delay, slightly less strenuous flight duty time limitations (FDTL) rules — that govern key issues like how much a pilot can fly with what rest periods and limits on night flying — are set to be enforced from this summer.“Many pilots have lost their lives suddenly in last few years, especially post Covid, and we have been fighting for a more humane FDTL. We just hope nothing else delays implementation of the new rules, something which we have seen in the past. Well rested and not stressed pilots are key to safe flights,” said many senior pilots.",DGCA orders probe into Air India Express captain Armaan's death at Delhi Airport.

Poll What do you think about PM Modi's approach to international partnerships? Aiming to attract investment and technology. Focus on strengthening global ties and innovation.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he had a conversation with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , revisiting topics from their earlier in-person meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. The two leaders spoke about bolstering collaboration between India and the United States in the areas of technology and innovation.“Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year,” PM Modi posted on social media platform X. “We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,” he added.The call comes amid growing interest from Musk’s companies - particularly Tesla and Starlink - in entering the Indian market. Tesla has been in talks with Indian officials over setting up a manufacturing base in the country. Meanwhile, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio in March had announced a pact with Musk's SpaceX to bring Starlink satellite internet services in India. Telecom tycoon Sunil Bharti Mittal's Bharti Airtel has also signed a similar partnership deal with SpaceX.PM Modi and Musk had previously met in February during PM’s two-day state visit to the US, where both sides expressed optimism about future cooperation in emerging sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, and space.During the meeting, the PM had presented books to Elon Musk’s three children. He had gifted them The Crescent Moon by Rabindranath Tagore, The Great RK Narayan Collection, and Panchatantra by Pandit Vishnu Sharma. He later shared photos that show the kids reading the books.PM Modi had shared a post on social media addressed to Elon Musk where he wrote, “Had a very good meeting with Elon Musk in Washington DC. We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation. I talked about India’s efforts towards reform and furthering ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.”The PM Modi-Musk call comes at a crucial juncture when permission for Starlink is stuck for security clearance. It also comes against the backdrop of ongoing negotiations for a proposed bilateral trade agreement between New Delhi and Washington.The two sides have aimed at finalising the first phase of the pact by fall (September-October) this year.Meanwhile, the government has already granted license to Startlink rivals Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite Communications for about one-and-a-half years for providing satellite internet services.However, these companies are yet to start their operation as the government has so far not finalised spectrum allocation rules.Starlink is considered to be a disruptor in this segment as it operates the world's biggest constellation of over 6,750 satellites whereas Eutelsat OneWeb has little over 600 satellites and Jio's satellite partners operate nearly 70.",PM Narendra Modi said he had a conversation with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The two leaders spoke about bolstering collaboration between India and the United States in the areas of technology and innovation. The call comes amid growing interest from Musk’s companies in entering the Indian market.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120402907,imgsize-47184,width-400,resizemode-4/File-photo-.jpg"
'Haven’t taken anybody’s name': Baba Ramdev defends 'sharbat jihad' remark amid Rooh Afza row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/havent-taken-anybodys-name-baba-ramdev-defends-sharbat-jihad-remark-amid-rooh-afza-row/articleshow/120403981.cms,"Baba Ramdev (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Friday defended his controversial "" sharbat jihad "" remark, saying he did not name any specific brand or community, even as criticism mounted over what was criticised as a communal statement allegedly aimed at the popular drink Rooh Afza .“I haven’t taken anybody’s name, but the Rooh Afza people took ‘sharbat jihad’ on themselves… this means they are doing this ‘jihad’,” Ramdev said.“If they are dedicated to Islam and are building masjids and madrasas, then they should be happy. However, the Sanatanis should understand… If someone has a problem with this, then let it be,"" he added.The controversy started around Baba Ramdev's statement earlier this week which was blasted by Congress leader Digvijaya Singh , who on Tuesday approached the TT Nagar police station in Bhopal demanding the registration of an FIR against Ramdev for allegedly promoting religious hatred and hurting communal sentiments.In his complaint, Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh, invoked sections 196(1)(a) and 299 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023, along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act. He alleged that Ramdev, while promoting Patanjali 's Gulab Sharbat, indirectly targeted Rooh Afza by implying that proceeds from its sale were used to fund madrasas and mosques — terming it “sharbat jihad.”Singh flagged a video purportedly shared from Ramdev’s official X account, claiming it was aimed at inciting communal sentiments to boost sales of Patanjali Ayurved's products. “This statement of Ramdev is hurtful, full of animosity, and intended to provoke religious sentiments,” Singh said. “Calling the sale of Rooh Afza ‘sharbat jihad’ is not just defamatory, but unconstitutional.”He had further alleged that Ramdev built a massive business empire by using religion and nationalism to promote his products, many of which, Singh claimed, have either failed to meet quality standards or have been banned by courts. “The entire country knows Ramdev was pointing at the Hamdard company, even though he didn’t name it directly,” Singh said. “Opposing a sharbat just because the owner is Muslim is hate speech, plain and simple.”Singh stated that if police fail to act within a week, he would approach the court seeking legal recourse. “I have demanded that an FIR be registered under the existing laws,” he said. Additional deputy commissioner of police Rashmi Agrawal confirmed that Singh’s complaint had been received. “We are probing the complaint and will take action as per the findings,” she said.","Baba Ramdev defends his controversial "" sharbat jihad "" remark.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs ( MEA ) on Friday strongly rejected Bangladesh 's comments regarding the recent communal violence in West Bengal's Murshidabad district, urging the neighbouring country to instead address the persecution of minorities within its own borders.""We reject the remarks made by the Bangladesh side with regard to the incidents in West Bengal.

Alam had also denied any Bangladeshi involvement in the Murshidabad violence through a statement to local media.""We strongly refute any attempts to implicate Bangladesh in the communal violence in Murshidabad,"" he told local daily.The violence, which erupted on April 11 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, claimed three lives and left several others injured. The unrest also resulted in significant property damage and forced many families to flee, with some seeking refuge in Jharkhand's Pakur district while others moved to relief camps in Malda.The Calcutta high court has ordered the continued deployment of central forces in Murshidabad to maintain law and order. The court, which will monitor the rehabilitation of victims, has also directed officials from political parties, including the BJP and TMC, to refrain from making inflammatory speeches that could worsen the situation.","India rejects Bangladesh's comments regarding the recent communal violence in West Bengal.

NEW DELHI: Govt will earn from the ropeway project connecting Sonprayag, Gaurikund and Kedarnath without any investment as Adani Enterprises has quoted a share of around 42% of the revenue with NHLML, the agency implementing such projects across the country. Considering that the nearly 13 km rope-way is expected to get a large number of pilgrims as it promises to reduce travel time to barely 36 minutes from 8-9 hours, three out of the four bidders had offered revenue sharing with the agency.The National Highway Logistics Management Ltd (NHLML) had earlier cancelled bids twice and after making several improvements, fresh bids were invited. Recently, the Cabinet had given its approval for the Rs 4,081 crore project to be implemented on public private partnership (PPP) mode.The ropeway will have the capacity to transport 18,000 persons per day or around 32 lakh per year. The Kedarnath temple is usually open for six months. The project will be completed in six years and the successful bidder will have the right to operate, maintain and collect the fare for 35 years.The Sonprayag-Kedarnath ropeway will be based on Tri-cable Detachable Gondola (3S) technology and each gandola can accommodate 36 passengers.Last year around 23 lakh pilgrims visited Kedarnath shrine.Officials said that the financial bids for the 12.4 km Govindghat-Ghangaria-Hemkund Sahib ropeway project would be opened next week. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 2,730 crore and it will have the capacity to transport 11,000 passengers per day.","Govt will earn from the ropeway project connecting Sonprayag, Gaurikund and Kedarnath.

The survey was completed in 2018, but the report remained under wraps for years.Another commission, led by Jayaprakash Hegde, revised the report using data from Kantharaj commission.Although CM Siddaramaiah seems inclined to implement the report, opposition from some of his ministers has proved a hurdle. Those opposed to the report fault the methodology, pointing to allegedly inflated data pertaining to marginal sub-castes within the Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities and lower representation of the dominant sub-castes.Some have complained that no enumerator visited their houses in past decade. These charges have been fuelled by allegations of enumerators admitting the exercise was riddled with challenges because of inadequate publicity and public awareness.Urban enumeration was particularly problematic as they purportedly couldn't enter gated communities or high-rise apartment complexes where people from some dominant caste groups reside.""We were asked to survey large areas in a short time. In cities like Bengaluru, we would be turned away from flats, with residents unwilling to disclose caste details,"" said an enumerator who worked at Rajajinagar.A field officer from Davanagere shared similar concerns. ""We were asked to record caste details based on sub-sect & not religion. Many entries had to be completed manually, and there was confusion about caste classification as people gave evasive answers. Some communities were unsure how to describe themselves. This was because there was no awareness about the exercise and why it was being conducted.""SK Murthy, a public policy researcher from Mysuru, said the govt should release the raw data and explain the methodology used for the survey. ""Transparency is key. If there are errors, let these be debated in the open. Independent data auditors should be brought in as there is still scope for making corrections,"" he said.Siddaramaiah declared recently that 95% of report was accurate. ""Without examining it, one should not dismiss it as unscientific.""The govt might set up a panel to re-examine the urban data. ""We are open to suggestions. Our aim is not to divide but to deliver welfare based on evidence,"" said a senior official in the chief minister's office.State BJP president BY Vijayendra said the Congress govt may have ""wasted over Rs 150 crore"" on an exercise whose credibility had been called into question by its own ministers. ""Many communities, including Jains and backwards classes, are contradicting the numbers shown in the report. BJP has repeatedly stated this survey was not carried out properly.CM Siddaramaiah contested reports of dissent within his cabinet over the caste survey report. ""It was discussed in cabinet yesterday. The data was incomplete, so next discussion is scheduled for May 2. Nobody has opposed the report,"" he said.","The Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, headed by H Kantharaj, started its socio-economic and educational survey in 2015.

Headley was interrogated by NIA in the US just once in 2010.An officer privy to the case developments said an NIA team is probing Rana to gather undisclosed details of the 26/11 conspiracy - including the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds Hafiz Saeed, Zakir ur Rehman Lakhvi, Abdur Rehman, Ilyas Kashmiri and ISI officers Major Samir Ali and Major Iqbal etc, besides a contact in Dubai - that don't figure in the US department of justice's case records. NIA will take a call ""as and when needed"" on whether it should seek fresh access to Headley to confront him with any additional information revealed by Rana, an officer told TOI. It will be interesting to see how the US will view such a request.Sources said Rana, who had cited multiple health concerns in pleas before US courts to stall his extradition, is being subjected to medical examination every 48 hours in NIA custody. A source said Rana has been cooperating with the investigation, but brings up his ailments from time to time.Meanwhile, former home secretary G K Pillai, who was in office when Headley was questioned in the US by NIA, told TOI that Headley was Rana's prime link to the 26/11 conspiracy and would regularly update the latter on the Pakistani handlers' terror plans and reconnaissance tips. Headley had first informed Rana in 2006 that he was tasked by LeT to conduct surveillance of 26/11 targets. Rana, a deserter from Pakistan Army, was included in the terror plot by Headley, in consultation with his LeT handlers. Rana arranged travel documents for Headley and allowed his immigration business to be used as a ""cover"" for Headley's reconnaissance trips to both India and Denmark.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana is being questioned by NIA about the larger Lashkar-e- Taiba conspiracy behind 26/11attacks.

Decades later, the group of villagers falsely claimed Harbans had lived with one of them and passed away leaving a will, aiming to claim his property.As they failed to prove the presence of the soldier, HC upheld their conviction and three-year term awarded by the trial court. ""If it is proved that a person has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he was alive, then the burden of proof that he is still alive would rest upon the person who affirms the factum of his living,"" Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu said in his April 7 order.HC directed the seven, who were out on bail, to surrender before a Nawanshahr court within six weeks and undergo the remaining part of their sentence. Joginder, on whose complainant the FIR was filed in 1996, died during court proceedings, as did some of the accused.Joginder married Harbans in 1941, and he joined the Army about a year later. She never saw or heard from him after 1943. Harbans owned over 50 kanal (approximately 6.2 acres) of land. With no kids and advanced in age, she lived with one Bawa Singh, who supported her.""The offence is serious, inasmuch as, the petitioners committed forgery with a soldier who left his wife, house, and property to serve in WW2. Taking advantage of his absence, petitioners opened a fake bank account in the name of Harbans Singh, manufactured a forged will dated April 7, 1992, and thereafter, procured a false entry of his death. Thus, in the opinion of this court, petitioners do not deserve any leniency on the quantum of sentence,"" HC held while dismissing a plea by the seven against their conviction.According to the prosecution, the seven villagers forged a bank passbook of Joginder's husband, entered a false death record, concocted a will through impersonation, and manipulated revenue officials to fraudulently transfer land ownership. They were sentenced by the lower court in July 2010 and their conviction was later upheld by a sessions court. They later appealed in HC.","Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the conviction of seven villagers for attempting to swindle land.

800-page chargesheet filed against 'insurance mafia',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/800-page-chargesheet-filed-against-insurance-mafia/articleshow/120417484.cms,"MEERUT: Three months after a an insurance scam worth hundreds of crores was unearthed in Sambhal , police have filed an 800-page chargesheet against 11 accused - residents of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand. The group - dubbed the "" insurance mafia "" - allegedly created fraudulent life insurance policies involving the dying and even those already dead to siphon off money from reputed companies such as ICICI Prudential, PNB MetLife, Bajaj Allianz and SBI Life Insurance.TOI was the first to expose the scam and had then reported extensively on the reach, pattern and players involved in the multi-state fraud.The investigation, led by Sambhal SP Krishna Kumar Vishnoi, ASP Anukriti Sharma, and circle officer Deepak Kumar, came after a tip-off that revealed a 26-member syndicate operating across many states. These individuals were subsequently arrested in connection with several FIRs lodged against them.""The 800-page chargesheet, filed on Thursday, has every detail of the evidence collected from Jan 17 when an SUV was intercepted in Sambhal and unexplained cash in large quantity along with PAN cards, debit cards, etc, were found in it. That led to unearthing of the scam, spread across 12 states. As of now, we've named 11 accused, including Omkareshwar Mishra (Varanasi); Surajpal, Shahrukh Khan from Sambhal; and Shivendra Kumar from Bihar, in the chargesheet. Since it is an ongoing investigation, there are many others who are on the run or under the radar. Their names will be included in supplementary chargesheets,"" ASP Sharma said on Friday.The gang operated through a sophisticated and unethical scheme primarily targeting poor, terminally-ill people. These seriously sick men and women would be falsely presented as healthy to secure life insurance policies. Since they were often close to death, the gang paid the premiums and reaped full insurance benefits soon after their demise and disappeared.The criminals also managed to create backdated insurance policies for those who had already died. They then claimed and split the payout among themselves.""In certain cases, they offered the deceased's family a small share of the claim money. In others, the family concerned was left completely unaware and uncompensated,"" revealed ASP Sharma.Till now, 14 FIRs have been filed in police stations in Sambhal as well as in neighbouring districts such as Badaun, Moradabad and Amroha.","Police have filed an 800-page chargesheet against 11 accused - residents of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand.

Military operations crippled as ALHs continue to remain grounded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/military-operations-crippled-as-alhs-continue-to-remain-grounded/articleshow/120416162.cms,"'Dhruv' advanced light helicopters

NEW DELHI: It’s a double whammy for the armed forces. Already grappling with the high crash rate and low serviceability of their 350 obsolete single-engine Cheetah and Chetak choppers, the prolonged grounding of the around 330 twin-engine `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) has majorly hit military operations and preparedness.The armed forces bank heavily on the multi-role ALHs for ‘sustenance flights’ to forward areas and posts along the unresolved borders with China and Pakistan as well as for observation and reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. “All have suffered major disruptions for over three months now. ALH pilots are also losing flying currency, and forced to make do with simulators,” a senior officer told TOI.The most affected is the over 11.5-lakh strong Army, which has a fleet of over 180 ALHs, including 60 weaponized versions called `Rudra’, manufactured by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The IAF, in turn, has 75 ALHs, while Navy 24 and Coast Guard 19. The 5.5-tonne ALHs have been military workhorses since their induction began in 2002, with the choppers in the Army alone clocking around 40,000 hours of flying in 2023-24.The grounding of all the ALHs, ever since a crash killed two Coast Guard pilots and an aircrew diver in Porbandar on Jan 5, has also compounded the long-standing problem of huge shortfalls in rotary-wing birds.The armed forces, in fact, have projected a requirement of over 1,000 new choppers of different types over the next 10-15 years, including 484 light utility helicopters (LUH) in the 3.5-tonne class and 419 Indian multi-role helicopters (IMRH) in the 10-15-tonne class. But there has been huge delays in these projects being executed by HAL.These new choppers are in addition to the 156 `Prachand’ light combat helicopters (Army 90, IAF 66) that have to be delivered in the 2028-2033 timeframe under the Rs 62,700 crore deal inked with HAL last month.A small silver lining in the overall grim situation has been the Army’s hiring of some civil choppers for transportation of troops and supply of logistics to remote high-altitude posts along the northern and western borders.“The use of civil choppers was started by the Army’s Northern and Central Commands last Nov due to the huge shortage of helicopters. If that had not been done, it would have become extremely tough to supply troops deployed in forward locations after the grounding of ALHs,” an officer said.Under this first-ever outsourcing of logistical support, the Army has inked contracts worth over Rs 70 crore with Pawan Hans, Himalayan Heli Services, Global Vectra, and Thumby Aviation for airlift of over 1,000 tonne of supplies from mid-Nov to mid-July. Till now, these civil choppers have flown over 1,500 hours to deliver about 900 tonne in Kargil, Gurez, Kishtwar, Garhwal and Himachal sectors, among others.“They proved a boon for soldiers deployed in over 30 remote posts in high altitude areas of Himalayas in J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand especially after the ALH fleet was grounded. The Army plans to begin this soon in the eastern sector as well,” the officer said.The use of civil helicopters for such logistical tasks also helps preserve the operational service life of military helicopters for more critical roles during conflicts or emergencies.The ALHs, of course, need to take to the skies again soon. HAL, however, is yet to conclusively establish the “root cause” behind the “swashplate fracture” in the ill-fated helicopter that made the Coast Guard pilots lose control of their flying machine over three months ago. Safety checks have found signs of similar material failures in some other ALHs, officials said.“ALHs have been grounded three-four times for safety checks after crashes in recent years. This time, the entire process should be thorough and transparent without any patchwork solutions. Precious lives and operational preparedness, after all, cannot be put at risk,” an experienced military pilot said.",The prolonged grounding of the around 330 twin-engine `Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) has majorly hit military operations and preparedness.

SRINAGAR: A day after a high-powered committee of Union home ministry (MHA) invited Ladakhi political parties for a meeting in New Delhi on May 20, the parties said on Friday that they are optimistic and hopeful about the outcome of the meeting, but held out the prospect of an agitation if the meeting does not yield the desired results.“We are hopeful that all issues related to recruitment, reservations, and domicile will be resolved in the forthcoming meeting,” Asgar Ali Karbalai and Chering Dorjey Lakrook, representatives of the Kargil Democratic Alliance and Leh Apex Body, told reporters at Leh.They said they expect that talks on main issues — statehood and sixth schedule status for Ladakh — would be discussed in the forthcoming meeting.The meeting will be chaired by Union minister of state for home, Nityanand Rai. Representatives of Leh Apex Body (LAB), an amalgam of various political outfits of Leh, and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), a grouping of several political bodies of Kargil, are jointly attending it.On Friday, KDA and LAB representatives met in Leh to discuss strategy for the MHA meeting. After the joint meeting, they addressed a media conference.Karbalai said if the outcome of the May 20 meeting is positive, the talks would continue. However, he warned that if the meeting fails to come up with positive results, they would launch an agitation. “We are hopeful that keeping the strategic location of Ladakh in mind, the central govt will come up with decisions on statehood and the sixth schedule status for Ladakh,” Karbalai said.Haji Mohammad Hanifa Jan, MP of Ladakh, who also addressed the conference, urged the central govt to ensure that the meeting yields positive results in maintaining peace in Ladakh. “We should have concrete recommendations after the May 20 meeting,” he said.The last meeting between the MHA with LAB and KDA was held on January 15. The two political bodies are pressing for a four-point agenda; statehood for Ladakh , sixth schedule status, a dedicated Public Service Commission, and two parliamentary seats for the region. They are also demanding 95% job reservation for Ladakh residents and 5% to those who have attained domicile of the region. They, however, demand that a person living in Ladakh since 1989 must be considered eligible for domicile status.Since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of J&K into two UTs, J&K and Ladakh, Ladakh UT has seen many political agitations seeking statehood for Ladakh and sixth schedule status.Sonam Wangchuk, Ladakhi environmentalist, led several agitations including long fasts to seek “constitutional safeguards on the lines of the sixth schedule to safeguard demography, environment, and the unique culture of Ladakh.”On January 2, 2023, the MHA established a high-powered committee to address key issues in Ladakh after protests in the UT for the sixth schedule status.","A high-powered committee of Union home ministry (MHA) invited Ladakhi political parties for a meeting in New Delhi on May 20.

No, I disagree with him. Yes, I completely agree.

Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain: Dhankhar on discovery of cash at high court judge's house

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday criticised the Supreme Court’s recent judgment that set a timeline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by governors, saying such a directive undermines the constitutional role of the country’s highest office.Speaking to the sixth batch of Rajya Sabha interns at the Vice-President’s Enclave, Dhankhar questioned, “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?”""There is a directive to the President by a recent judgement. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day. President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, becomes law,"" Dhankhar added.""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" he further added.Also read: In a first, SC sets 3-month deadline for President to decide on bills referred by governors He added that the Constitution gives the judiciary the power to interpret the law under Article 145(3), but it does not authorise courts to issue directives to the President.""The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3). There it has to be five judges or more,"" the VP said.His comments come in response to an April 8 judgment by the Supreme Court, which for the first time imposed a three-month deadline for the President to act on bills reserved by state governors. The apex court held that any delay beyond this period must be justified, and urged state governments to cooperate with the Centre on such matters. The ruling followed a constitutional standoff in Tamil Nadu, where Governor RN Ravi had withheld assent to several bills for extended periods, prompting the state to seek judicial intervention.Speaking on the alleged discovery of cash at former Delhi high court judge Yashwant Verma's house, Dhankhar said the President and Governors enjoy constitutional immunity from prosecution, a privilege not extended to other public figures, including judges.Dhankhar said it has been over a month since the issue came to light and “let the worms and skeletons be in public domain”.""It is now over a month. Even if it is can of worms. Even if there are skeletons in the cupboard, time to blow up the can. Time for its lid to go out. And time for the cupboard to collapse. Let the worms and skeletons be in public domain so that cleansing takes place,"" VP Jagdeep Dhankhar said.The Supreme Court, in its ruling, had set aside the Tamil Nadu Governor ’s second round of referring ten bills to the President, calling it legally flawed. The justices clarified that if the President withholds assent, the state government has the right to challenge the decision in court.","Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court's recent judgment that set a timeline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by governors.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday explained the reason behind its decision to withdraw the transhipment facility for Bangladeshi exports and said that it was a response to Dhaka's actions affecting bilateral trade.The decision seems to came after Bangladesh's interim government stopped Indian yarn imports and closed three land ports.""We stand for a democratic, for an inclusive, and for a prosperous Bangladesh. As far as trade issues are concerned, last week we had made an announcement regarding trans-shipment facility,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during weekly media briefing when asked about India-Bangladesh trade relations.""We had taken that measure because of the congestion that we see on our Ports and our Airports. But I would also remind you, please do have a look at the developments that have happened on the Bangladeshi side prior to us announcing these measures,"" he added.India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.Global brands such as Zara, which use the route to meet their international need, will have to rework their sourcing strategy. The customs circular, issued Tuesday, said cargo that had already entered India would be allowed to be shipped out. Confirming the development that comes amid the strife in India-Bangladesh ties, MEA said the transshipment used to cause congestion at Indian airports and ports, but added the order won't hit Dhaka's exports to Nepal and Bhutan passing through India.The transhipment arrangement, established in 2020 to enhance trade relations, has been affected by recent developments.Jaiswal mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Muhammad Yunus during their initial meeting in Thailand at a BIMSTEC Summit, expressing India's desire for ""positive and constructive"" relations with Bangladesh.Bangladesh suspended Indian yarn imports through land ports in March. Additionally, a committee under Bangladesh's interim government suggested closing Chilahati, Daulatganj and Tegamukh land ports along the Indian border, while recommending suspension of Balla land port operations.India-Bangladesh relations deteriorated significantly after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's departure from Dhaka in August last year amid large-scale anti-government protests.Relations worsened further when the interim government led by Yunus proved unable to prevent attacks against minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh.","India has disallowed transshipment of cargo from Bangladesh to third countries, dealing a blow to Dhaka exporting apparel through air freighters, largely from Delhi.

US Visa Denial: Indian national’s US visa denied in 40 seconds.

NEW DELHI: An Indian national shared their disappointing experience on Reddit of being denied a US B1/B2 tourist visa within 40 seconds of their interview, despite having a steady job and a clear travel plan. The post has since drawn widespread attention, sparking a discussion on common pitfalls in the US visa application process.The user, who planned a two-week vacation in Florida to visit popular attractions like Disney World and Universal Studios, said their visa interview at the US Embassy was cut short after just three questions.“Why do you want to travel to the US?”, “Have you travelled outside of India?”, and “Do you have family or friends in the US?”, these were the only questions asked before the consular officer handed over a 214(b) refusal slip.In response, the user admitted they had no prior international travel experience and that their girlfriend resides in Florida. “I said yes, my girlfriend lives in Florida whom I plan to visit,” they explained. Immediately after this, the officer declared them ineligible.A fellow Reddit user summed up the situation bluntly: “You’re a textbook denial, unfortunately for you. You have zero travel history, and a girlfriend in the US. That’s a strong tie to America and no strong reason to return to India.”Failure to demonstrate strong ties to one's home country is among the most common reasons for visa rejection. These ties can include stable employment, property, or family commitments.In this case, despite the applicant having a steady job in India, the lack of international travel history combined with the mention of a romantic partner in the US may have raised red flags regarding the risk of overstaying.Visa applicants are also advised to ensure clarity and consistency in presenting their travel purpose. Providing incorrect or inconsistent information about travel plans, or failing to adequately explain the purpose of the visit, can raise doubts and lead to denial.While the Redditor was honest about their reasons, others on the thread suggested a more cautious approach. One user advised, “You could have just said, ‘I have a friend.’ There was no need to say girlfriend.” Another recommended building a stronger travel record by first visiting countries in Europe or Asia.Before applying for a US visa, applicants must prepare thoroughly for the interview by familiarising themselves with the purpose of their trip and being able to articulate their travel plans clearly.","An Indian national shared their disappointing experience on Reddit of being denied a US B1/B2 tourist visa.

GST on UPI transactions: Government denies reports of levying GST on UPI transactions over Rs 2000,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/false-misleading-government-denies-reports-of-levying-gst-on-upi-transactions-over-rs-2000/articleshow/120408353.cms,"The government on Friday denied reports suggesting GST levying on UPI transactions exceeding Rs 2,000, calling such claims “completely false, misleading, and without any basis. ”In an official statement, the finance ministry said, “Currently, there is no such proposal before the government,” dismissing concerns that had surfaced earlier.The ministry also clarifyed the tax framework, explaining that GST is only applicable on charges like the merchant discount rate (MDR), which are relevant for certain payment methods.However, in January 2020, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) eliminated MDR on person-to-merchant (P2M) UPI transactions.“Since currently no MDR is charged on UPI transactions, there is consequently no GST applicable to these transactions,” the ministry stated.UPI, or Unified Payments Interface , has witnessed a remarkable surge in usage, with transaction values skyrocketing from Rs 21.3 lakh crore in 2019-20 to a soaring Rs 260.56 lakh crore, that was projected by the end of March 2025.To further encourage this growth, the government has been running an incentive scheme since 2021-22, specifically aimed at low-value P2M UPI transactions.The initiative is designed to support small merchants by absorbing transaction costs and driving broader adoption of digital payments.In the last financial year, 2023-24, Rs 3,631 crore was disbursed under this scheme, a sharp rise from Rs 2,210 crore in 2022-23. In FY 2021-2011, the allocation was Rs 1,389 crore.“The total incentive payouts under this scheme over the years reflect the government's sustained commitment to promoting UPI-based digital payments,” the ministry added.The press release said that India accounted for 49 per cent of worldwide real time transactions in 2023, as per the ACI Worldwide report 2024.","GST is only applicable on charges like the merchant discount rate (MDR), which are relevant for certain payment methods.

Joe Alwyn’s post-breakup conduct earns industry-wide respect

Taylor Swift has also moved on from Joe Alwyn—gracefully

In the high-stakes world of celebrity breakups, Joe Alwyn is emerging not just unscathed—but even more respected. Following his quiet split from global pop icon Taylor Swift in April 2023, Alwyn has kept a dignified silence, which insiders say has only helped his career and personal reputation flourish.The 34-year-old Brutalist actor, Joe Alwyn made headlines earlier this year for his poised presence while presenting at the Oscars, but according to industry insiders, that was only a glimpse of his rising profile. “Joe was very wise during their breakup. He kept his head down and his mouth closed and focused strictly on his work,” a source revealed to Life & Style. “He didn’t give interviews about Taylor or do any social media rants, he didn’t even hit the like button on snarky posts.”That kind of maturity, especially in the era of viral drama, hasn't gone unnoticed. Insiders describe Joe Alwyn as “uber professional and respectful,” a demeanor that’s only helped him earn more credibility within Hollywood. “He’s got proven talent and he’s proven he’s a class act, that goes a long way with the decision makers,” the source added.Taylor Swift, now in a very public relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce since late 2023, appears to harbor no ill feelings. “Taylor has no bones to pick with him, she’s happily moved on, and he’s kept it classy the whole time,” the insider noted. Even her friends and industry peers have taken notice of Joe’s graceful handling of the split.Swift and Alwyn’s six-year relationship was notably low-key. “For me, I just don’t feel it’s something I want to offer up to be picked apart by people who don’t know about it,” Alwyn said in a 2018 interview with Total Film. Swift echoed the sentiment in a 2019 Guardian interview: “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we'd be talking about it—but it's just that it goes out into the world.”Also Read: “Pathetic”: Travis Kelce faces backlash from Swifties over podcast survey, accused of clout-chasing Taylor Swift Since their breakup, Joe Alwyn has remained grounded. “I have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,” he told The Guardian in January 2025.

According to TMZ and later confirmed by multiple outlets, the 76-year-old coach had a medical incident while dining at a local San Antonio restaurant on Tuesday night. The incident involving the NBA legend sparked concerns among fans.Emergency responders were called after someone reportedly fainted at the restaurant. TMZ obtained footage of Gregg Popovich being wheeled out on a stretcher and placed into an ambulance. While the team has remained quiet about the incident, sources close to the situation confirmed to the Associated Press that Popovich was taken to the hospital and is now back home, stable, and doing well.Popovich has not publicly addressed the situation, and the Spurs have chosen not to issue an official statement. GMSA anchor RJ Marquez provided a key update, writing, “The Spurs do not plan to release an official statement or comment on Coach Gregg Popovich. Pop had a medical incident at a local restaurant on Tuesday night, but is home and doing well. Best wishes to coach.”This incident comes just five months after Popovich suffered a mild stroke on November 2 at the Frost Bank Center. The stroke occurred a day before a scheduled game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The franchise announced the news nearly two weeks later, stating he was expected to make a full recovery. “At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined,” the Spurs said in a statement on November 13.Popovich, who had been away from coaching duties since the stroke, officially confirmed in late February that he would not return for the remainder of the 2024–25 season. In a heartfelt message, he praised his staff and players during his absence. “I’ve decided not to return to the sidelines this season,” Popovich said in a February 27 statement. “Mitch Johnson and his staff have done a wonderful job and the resolve and professionalism the players have shown, sticking together during a challenging season, has been outstanding. I will continue to focus on my health with the hope that I can return to coaching in the future.”While fans and media alike continue to speculate about his future with the team, there is still no official word on whether Popovich will return to coach for the 2025–26 NBA season. ESPN’s Shams Charania echoed the updates, noting that Popovich is currently “home, stable and doing fine.”Also Read: Sonya Curry showers praise for Stephen Curry’s brother Seth Curry after his latest accolade: “I’m so proud of you” For now, Coach Pop is resting and focusing on recovery, and the basketball world continues to send well-wishes to a coaching icon.","Gregg Popovich had a medical incident at a San Antonio restaurant on Tuesday night.

When asked about the purpose of his visit, he explained that he planned a two-week vacation in Florida, intending to visit attractions like Disney World, Universal Studios, and the Kennedy Space Center. The second question pertained to his travel history, to which he responded that he had no prior international travel experience. The final question was whether he had any friends or family in the US, and he mentioned that his girlfriend resides in Florida.Following these responses, the consular officer promptly informed him that he was not eligible for the visa and handed him a 214(b) refusal slip, a common form of rejection indicating the applicant failed to demonstrate strong ties to their home country.See more: Overnight US Visa slot vanishing act leaves Indian students in uncertainty Overnight US Visa slot vanishing act leaves Indian students in uncertaintyThis swift denial has sparked discussions on Reddit and other social media platforms about the challenges faced by visa applicants.

Poll Do you think the current political climate in the US is a deterrent for travelers from Europe? No, travelers will continue to visit Yes, many will avoid the US

: Indians are visiting America in greater numbers than ever before, even as travellers from other countries are shying away from the US, which is infused with MAGA fervour, according to recent surveys and travel industry data.Nearly 1.9 million Indian visitors travelled to the US from January to October 2024, marking a 48 per cent increase compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, according to the US National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO), which now says India as the 6th largest market for US inbound arrivals.While the numbers are from just before the Trump victory in the 2024 Presidential elections, the NTTO says India has emerged as the largest source market for outbound travelers in Asia, surpassing China, South Korea, and Japan in recent times. Tourism receipts from Indian visitors reached $13.3 billion in 2022, and with the 2024 increase in arrivals, this figure is likely higher, reflecting India’s high spending power, which the NTTO said averaged $5,200 per visitor.At the same time, globe-trotters from other parts of the world, rest of the world, particularly Europe, are turning their backs on US amid a flaming trade war and unremitting hostility from MAGA mouthpieces towards immigrants and foreigners. Even neighboring Canadians and Mexicans have been singed by MAGA rhetoric.A report from Tourism Economics revised its 2025 forecast for US inbound travel from an expected 9 per cent growth to a 9.4 per cent decline in international arrivals compared to 2024 -- a nearly 20 per cent swing. Data from March 2025 showed a 11.6 per cent year-over-year drop in overseas visitor arrivals, with significant declines from Canada (31.9 per cent by land, 13.5 per cent by air), Germany, and the UK.The NTTO also backed that data, reporting a more modest 3.3 per cent decrease in international visitors to the US in the first quarter of 2025 (7.1 million visitors) compared to 2024. Specifically, it said March 2025 saw an 11.6 per cent drop in overseas arrivals, with air travel from Mexico declining by 23 per cent.The organisation warned that the decline could result in a $64 billion loss in tourism revenue in 2025, even as political pundits wondered about the damage to US prestige and reputation from MAGA's overheated rhetoric, including Trump's repeated assertion that the US is being ""ripped off"" by the world and referring to other countries as ""scavengers"" feeding off the US market.While US travel industry executives are urging the administration and Congress to streamline visa issuance, immigration and customs processes etc to improve travel to America amid competition from other parts of the world, MAGA hardliners are worried about rare instances of ""birthright citizenship tourism"" where travel to US is planned in a way that pregnant women deliver the child in the US to obtain American citizenship.The travel industry meanwhile is spooked by seemingly hostile comments coming from Trump administration officials, including a recent statement from the White House podium that ""All foreign nationals present in the United States longer than 30 days must register with the federal government. Failure to comply with this is a crime punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both... If not, you will be arrested, fined, deported, never to return to our country again.""There is no federal requirement for tourists to register with US agencies during their stay, regardless of duration, unless specific conditions apply (e.g., visa overstays or changes in status).","Nearly 1.9 million Indian visitors travelled to the US from January to October 2024, marking a 48 per cent increase compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
