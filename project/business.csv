'He Has His Reasons...': Shashi Tharoor Reacts To Rahul Gandhi's Remark On Trump Tariffs

Poll How do you view the current state of the Indian economy? Somewhat positive Neutral

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday refused to comment on Rahul Gandhi ’s endorsement of US President Donald Trump ’s remark calling the Indian economy ""dead."" Tharoor said the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha may have had his ""own reasons"" for saying so, but stressed that maintaining economic ties with the US is vital for India.When asked about Rahul Gandhi's statement, Tharoor said, ""I don't want to comment on what my party leader has said. He has his reasons for saying so. My concern is that our relationship with the US, as a strategic partnership and economic relationship, is important for us. We are exporting around 90 billion worth of goods to America. We can't be in a position to lose that or have it diminish significantly.""He added, ""We must wish our negotiators strength to get a fair deal for India. We should also be talking to other regions for exporting our goods. Then we could make up for some of what we might lose in the US. We have to support our negotiators.""Tharoor’s response came after Rahul Gandhi, on Thursday, agreed with Trump’s description of the Indian economy. Gandhi had said, ""Yes, he is right. Everybody knows this except the prime minister and the finance minister. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact. The entire world knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy. BJP has finished the economy to help Adani. ""Trump had made the comment on Wednesday through his social media platform, Truth Social. In that post, he announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods and warned of additional penalties in response to India importing oil from Russia.","'He Has His Reasons...': Shashi Tharoor Reacts To Rahul Gandhi's Remark On Trump Tariffs.

Air India crash: UK families await update on DNA-matched remains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-crash-uk-families-await-update-on-dna-matched-remains/articleshow/123069128.cms,"LONDON: British families, waiting for the remains of relatives aboard the London-bound Air India 171 plane that crashed soon after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport, are expecting confirmation on DNA matches after high-level India-UK government talks, their legal team has said.Keystone Law, which has been working with aviation experts to assist many of the families who lost loved ones in the June 12 crash, called for urgency in the process this week.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's UK visit last week, Downing Street had confirmed that Prime Minister Keir Starmer had discussed the Air India plane crash during their bilateral talks against the backdrop of UK media reports of mislabelling of some remains repatriated to Britain.""The UK and Indian governments have held high-level talks, as a result of the international media coverage of this problem,"" said James Healy-Pratt, Aviation Partner at Keystone Law.""It is believed that some matched DNA remains may now have been located in India. Confirmation is awaited,"" he said.The 241 passengers and crew who died in the disaster included 52 British nationals, with two out of 12 caskets repatriated to the UK for last rites found to be incorrectly identified.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) had responded to the UK reports to stress that ""all mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased"".""We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue,"" the MEA's official spokesperson said in a statement last month.Asked to estimate the scale of the issue, Keystone Law said of a sample of 12 caskets repatriated from India to the UK, two were ""mislabelled, mishandled and misidentified"".""Extrapolated out - with an unacceptable error rate of 15 per cent, that would suggest 40 sets of remains may have been mislabelled, mishandled and misidentified. That is a known unknown, and many of the families' loved ones have been cremated already,"" said Healy-Pratt.Last month, an inquest into the deaths of some of the British passengers was opened and adjourned in London, with the process of identification overseen by the Senior Coroner under UK procedures.It came as a preliminary report by the Indian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) found that fuel to both engines appeared to have cut off shortly after takeoff.The engines tried to restart, but it proved too late to prevent the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft from crashing into Ahmedabad's B.J. Medical College, claiming 19 lives on the ground.Keystone Law called for further clarity about the transitioning of the fuel cutoff switches, and which voice was saying what on the excerpts of the Cockpit Voice Recorder.""The Indian AAIB has this evidence, and has for unexplained reasons not shared this detail with the families of AI 171. The Indian AAIB cannot complain of further speculation when evidence in its possession is not released to the families on a transparent basis,"" said Healy-Pratt.The aviation lawyer also called for further details around reports of compensation being considered for impacted families by the Tata Group, owners of Air India.Healy-Pratt said: ""There is talk of TATA setting up a (Rs) 500 crore fund for all the AI 171 families - which will provide ex gratia support (legally a gift and separate and apart from any Court ordered compensation against Air India, or indeed Boeing) of a minimum of (Rs) 1 crore per loved one lost.""Families deserve to get details of that support urgently, as legal proceedings take time in India, England, and the United States.""The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has ""expert status"" in the Indian safety investigation and has said it is reviewing the findings of the preliminary report released one month on from the crash, on July 12.The UK-based families who lost loved ones in the crash have previously also called for a mechanism of expert representation in the India-led investigatory process into the plane crash.",Keystone Law has been working with aviation experts to assist many of the families who lost loved ones in the June 12 crash.

He holds about 12% of Tesla, the electric car pioneer valued at hundreds of billions, and owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, a leader in commercial space technology.

His lifestyle and property holdings place him among the wealthiest tech moguls globally.Jeff Bezos revolutionized retail through Amazon, transforming it from a humble online bookstore into a global e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2021, Bezos retains significant wealth with a 9% stake in Amazon and ownership of Blue Origin, a space exploration company. Recently, he married Lauren Sánchez, marking a new personal chapter. Bezos also focuses on philanthropy, investing in climate change initiatives and education. His success story is a prime example of how innovation and risk-taking can create unprecedented wealth.Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, a social media platform that became an integral part of global communication.

Much of his wealth comes from Microsoft stock holdings, which continue to grow as the company remains a leader in cloud computing and software.Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is known globally as the “Oracle of Omaha” for his unmatched value investing strategies. Berkshire Hathaway owns diverse businesses like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, making it a financial powerhouse. Buffett is also a leading philanthropist, pledging most of his fortune to charitable causes through the Giving Pledge initiative.

English or other languages can occupy the rest of the space.To ensure compliance, deputy commissioners in many districts have issued circulars instructing trade licence applicants to submit photographic proof of their Kannada signage. The move follows review meetings conducted by Kannada Development Authority (KDA) in collaboration with local administrations.""We have instructed district administrations to mandate commercial and industrial establishments submit geotagged photographs of their signages as proof to get confirmation about the compliance of 60% Kannada signage,"" said KDA chairperson Purushottama Bilimale. ""The DCs and assistant commissioners (ACs) of sub-divisions are issuing orders to ensure the law is followed.""He said KDA had already covered 19 districts, holding meetings with respective deputy commissioners and district officials, and that similar reviews will be conducted in the remaining districts soon.In parallel, some deputy commissioners have written to the state govt seeking approval to link the Kannada signage requirement to industrial benefits under the new Karnataka Industrial Policy 2025–30. The proposal would make photographic evidence of Kannada signage a precondition to access state incentives and concessions.KDA's intensified push comes after concerns that many businesses were ignoring signage rules, despite the amendment being notified earlier this year. The submission of geotagged photos is intended to eliminate ambiguity and offer clear, location-tagged evidence of compliance. Bilimale said the goal is not punitive but to promote uniform respect for Kannada across commercial spaces in the state.","Kannada must occupy 60% of space on all business, industrial, and commercial signages.

The world economy is facing instability and uncertainty. In such times, countries are focusing solely on their own interests. India, too, is on the path to becoming the world's third-largest economy and must remain alert to its own economic priorities,"" PM Modi said.Calling for a nationwide movement to support indigenous industry, the Prime Minister said the time had come for every Indian, across political lines, to rise above partisanship and back the local economy.""This is not just about Modi saying it, every Indian should say this, if we want India to become the third-largest economy, every political party and every leader, keeping aside their hesitations, must work in the nation's interest and awaken the spirit ofamong the people,"" he said.Also read: Trade war, tariffs notified, government hardens its position on no-go areas PM Modi also said that the government is doing its part to support farmers, small industries, and youth employment, but stressed that national transformation cannot happen without citizen participation.""The government is doing everything possible in this direction.

Promoting made in India goods will be the truest service to the country,"" he said.PM Modi futher urged people to be conscious consumers, asking them to reflect on the origins of every purchase.""Whatever we buy, we should ask ourselves, has an Indian toiled to make this? If it has been made by the sweat of our people, with their skills, that product is Swadeshi for us. We must adopt the mantra of 'Vocal for Local',"" the PM said.Recalling earlier instances when families shifted wedding plans from abroad to India following his appeal, PM Modi said Swadeshi is not just an economic choice but a cultural and national statement.""The feeling of Swadeshi in every action will define our future. This will also be a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. Only through collective effort can we fulfil the dream of a developed India,"" PM Modi said.","PM Modi urges Indians to prioritise locally-made products and stand united in the face of growing global economic uncertainty.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sent a clear message to the United States amid an escalating trade standoff, saying the welfare of farmers, small industries and youth remains the government’s “top priority. ”“India is set to become the world’s third largest economy... therefore, India must remain vigilant about its economic interests.

I had pledged to take revenge for my daughters' sindoor, and I fulfilled it with the blessings of Mahadev,” Modi said. “Operation Sindoor showed the world India’s fierce form.

NEW DELHI: As part of the Navy’s ongoing operational deployment to Southeast Asia with an eye firmly on China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, three Indian warships have now reached the Philippines while another is exercising with the Singapore Navy.The deployments of stealth frigate INS Satpura for the bilateral “Simbex” exercise with the Singapore Navy as well as guided-missile destroyer INS Delhi, anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kiltan and fleet tanker INS Shakti to Manila “is a testimony to the Indian Navy’s commitment to strengthen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”, officers said.Leading the three warships in Manila, Eastern Fleet commander Rear Admiral Susheel Menon said India and the Philippines shared the commitment towards maintaining stability and enhancing maritime security in the region, emphasizing the importance of such deployments in promoting understanding, trust and cooperation among friendly maritime forces.The warships will undertake a bilateral naval exercise with the Philippines, which will focus on joint manoeuvres and communication protocols to improve preparedness, build mutual trust and strengthen operational synergy in the maritime domain.INS Satpura, in turn, is participating in the 32nd edition of the Simbex exercise, marking yet another chapter in the strong and enduring maritime partnership between the Indian Navy and the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).“The exercise involves execution of a comprehensive array of advanced naval operations.

NEW DELHI: With countries gearing up for a crucial meeting of the UN's International Negotiating Committee (INC) in Geneva from Aug 5-14 to finalise a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution, India will pitch for ""consensus-based decision making"" to reach an agreement that should focus on aspects related to ""plastic pollution only"" without affecting right to sustainable development of developing countries.""Aspects which are not directly related to plastic pollution should not be taken up. We need to strike a critical balance between preventing plastic pollution without affecting the right to sustainable development of developing countries and keeping in view their respective national circumstances,"" Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav told TOI recently in an interview.Specifically asked about an obstacle before developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution and India's stand in this context, Yadav said the country believes that the success of negotiations at INC require consensus-based decision making with the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation for reaching an agreement on various provisions.He further said, ""As developed countries have higher per capita generation of plastic waste and have historical responsibility, they need to provide financial and technical assistance by setting up a standalone multilateral fund which provides incremental cost for transition to developing countries for meeting compliance obligations.""The treaty is vital as currently more than 460 million metric tonne of plastic is produced globally every year, of which an estimated 20 million tonne ends up polluting the environment by affecting land, freshwater and marine habitats.The situation will gradually become more serious as global plastic waste is expected to reach 1.7 billion metric tonne by 2060.Sensing the urgency, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) had in 2022 adopted a resolution to create a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution and mandated the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to convene INC to develop such an instrument.Since 2022, the INC has met five times but could not come out with a desired result.

NEW DELHI: Now, all vegetable oil producers and processors will have to furnish monthly details of arrival of raw materials, production, import, sale, export and stock in hand to the food ministry, a move that will help the govt get real-time updates on availability rather than depending on data from their associations.The ministry has amended the Vegetable Oil Products, Production and Availability (VOPPA) Regulation Order of 2011 by notifying fresh changes. Industry sources said India has over 15,000 oil mills and more than 250 vanaspati manufacturing units.

All have submitted their Form 6 with the mandatory declaration.As reported by TOI, EC, in an exercise aimed at 100% transparency, put out the first of its daily reports Saturday on the partywise claims and objections received from BLAs and resolved by the electoral registration officer or assistant ERO. As per rules, claims and objections are to be disposed of after the expiry of seven days.The update shared by the poll panel lists 'zero' claims and objections filed between 3pm on Aug 1 and 3pm on Aug 2, by the BLAs appointed by RJD, Congress, CPM, AAP, BSP, National People's Party, BJP, JD(U), CPI (ML) (Liberation), LJP (Ram Vilas), Rashtriya LJP and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party.The district election officers of all of Bihar's 38 districts had Friday shared the draft electoral roll for all 90,712 polling booths with the political parties.It also provided them the list of electors who were there in the roll as on June 24, 2025, but are not in the draft electoral roll published Friday.The absence of any claim or objection from RJD, which has 47,506 BLAs in the field, is interesting given that Saturday started with party chief Tejashwi Yadav claiming his name was not in the roll. The claim turned out to be incorrect as a copy of the draft roll for the relevant booth in Digha assembly constituency lists not only Tejashwi as entry no. 416, but also his wife Rajshree as entry no. 445.Tejashwi had earlier, while objecting to the non-inclusion of Aadhaar in list of documentation accepted under SIR, voiced the fear that his wife, who only has Aadhaar, may not be on the roll.EC on Saturday said it is not able to understand why Tejashwi is making such baseless allegations. As regards his fears regarding large-scale deletions, the poll panel said he should ask his 47,506 BLAs to file claims and objections, for which they have an entire month from Aug 1 to Sept 1. ""No BLA of any political party has submitted a single case to BLOs during the last 24 hours. This, despite all BLAs having agreed to go through the boothwise draft lists given to them on August 1, carefully,"" said the commission.EC is meanwhile issuing advertisements in print, TV and social media to create awareness among the electors of Bihar regarding the option of filing claims and objections.

Poll What do you think is the biggest issue causing urban flooding during monsoon? Poor drainage systems Lack of planning and maintenance

NEW DELHI: Continuous heavy rainfall on Saturday brought large parts of Bihar’s capital Patna to a standstill, causing severe waterlogging and traffic congestion.Visuals from Kurji Road and other low-lying areas showed flooded streets, traffic jams, and pedestrians struggling to navigate waterlogged roads.The flood-like situation disrupted normal life and exposed administrative lapses in monsoon preparedness. Despite repeated assurances by civic authorities about improved drainage systems and better planning, the city appeared unprepared once again.Commuters faced long traffic jams in various parts of the city, as vehicles were stuck or slowed down due to waterlogging. Pedestrians were seen wading through flooded roads with extreme caution, fearing open manholes, uncovered drains, and the threat of electric shocks from submerged wires and poles.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in the region over the next few days.Moreover, contaminated water triggered a diarrhea outbreak in Bihar's Jehanabad. Civil surgeon Devendra Prasad, while talking to reporters, said, ""...More than 25-30 people, mostly children, were affected and treated. All have returned home after testing.

Leadership commitment and strategic significance

“We had the honour of hosting His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum aboard a passenger train journey between the emirates of Dubai and Fujairah. This exemplifies the unwavering commitment of the UAE's visionary leadership to support national projects that propel the progress of our nation.”

“Today, we stand on the cusp of a transformative era in the UAE's transportation landscape and take immense pride in and deeply appreciate the support we have received for this national project,”





In a significant step toward reshaping the UAE’s transportation landscape, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, travelled aboard a passenger train between Dubai and Fujairah. This symbolic journey marks a critical phase in the Etihad Rail project, one of the most ambitious rail networks in the world, laying the groundwork for full passenger operations by 2026.His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum shared photos on X of his journey aboard the Etihad Rail passenger train between Dubai and Fujairah, calling it a memorable ride. He was welcomed by a delegation from Etihad Rail led by Chief Business Support Officer Saeed AlAhbabi, along with several senior company executives.During the visit, Sheikh Mohammed was briefed on the project’s progress and key construction milestones. Speaking about Etihad Rail, he said:He described it as one of the country’s most significant infrastructure projects, with far-reaching economic, social, and developmental benefits that enhance connectivity and support national goals. He noted that the project reflects the spirit of the Union and contributes to sustainability, integration, and quality of life across all emirates.The passenger service is expected to begin commercial operations in 2026.Etihad Rail is a 1,200km-long national railway infrastructure project designed to connect key regions across the UAE and extend outward to neighbouring countries. With an investment of AED 40 billion (approximately $11 billion), the network will transport both freight and passengers, linking the Gulf coast with the Indian Ocean.The network will ultimately span the country from Ghuweifat on the Saudi border to Fujairah on the eastern coast. The western section connects to Saudi Arabia via Ghweifat, while the eastern extension links Oman through Al Ain. It traverses vital strategic locations including:The railway system is being built in two phases:The network connects industrial hubs, raw material sources, ports, and major urban centres. Key nodes include Khalifa Port, KIZAD, Jebel Ali Port, and various inland cities, facilitating an integrated logistics and transport framework for the UAE and beyond.Scheduled to launch commercial operations in 2026, the Etihad Rail passenger service represents a major leap forward in public transportation. It will provide a fast, reliable, and sustainable alternative to road and air travel, with trains expected to operate at speeds of up to 200 km/hr.The passenger rail will stretch approximately 900km, connecting 11 key cities and regions across all seven emirates, including:Trains will initially operate through four major stations: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, and Fujairah. Each train will be capable of accommodating up to 400 passengers, with annual ridership expected to reach 36.5 million by 2030.The design emphasizes passenger comfort and efficiency, promising reduced travel times and improved access across the country. As part of the UAE’s broader goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the rail system is built with sustainability at its core, offering a green alternative to road transport and helping to reduce the nation’s carbon footprint.The passenger service is also expected to improve daily mobility, boost tourism and regional development, strengthen social ties across emirates, and support the UAE’s broader logistics strategy.His Highness Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of Etihad Rail, highlighted the importance of Sheikh Mohammed’s involvement, noting:He emphasized Sheikh Mohammed’s integral role in the project's evolution, from its inclusion in the “Projects of the 50” initiative in 2021 to the recent inauguration of the national freight network in 2023:he said, emphasizing the project’s role in strengthening connectivity and boosting the nation’s economic integration.Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s visit to the Etihad Rail passenger train highlights his direct involvement in key infrastructure projects that connect the entire country and support the UAE’s development plans.Last week, he made an unannounced visit to a Dubai Tram station, riding the tram and engaging directly with commuters to assess public transport services firsthand. This follows a similar visit in 2023, when he quietly rode the Dubai Metro. Together, These visits exemplify his hands-on approach to leadership and governance, reflecting a familiar and consistent commitment to staying connected with developments on the ground.","Etihad Rail is a 1,200km national railway project that began in 2016 and is being developed in phases at a cost of Dh40 billion.

Who is Mira Murati? Former OpenAI CTO who rejected Mark Zuckerberg’s $1 billion offer to join Meta AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-mira-murati-former-openai-cto-who-rejected-mark-zuckerbergs-1-billion-offer-to-join-meta-ai/articleshow/122994020.cms,"Mira Murati: The mind behind ChatGPT and beyond

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. She also oversaw OpenAI's deployment of safety protocols that became foundational to industry-wide AI governance frameworks. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. She was instrumental in assembling the original alignment teams, ensuring ethical considerations were baked into product design from the earliest stages. Murati once remarked, “We don’t just code intelligence—we craft responsibility,” a phrase that has since become a rallying cry for ethical AI development. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder. Her ability to bridge the worlds of deep tech and global policy has made her one of the few technologists shaping both the tools and the laws that will define this century. Her growing influence in policy circles signals that she’s not just building AI—but helping shape the rules by which it will operate.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. The company is pioneering customizable, interpretable AI systems designed to be tailored to local languages, cultures, and industries—advancing the democratization of advanced AI technology globally. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks. This wasn't just a rejection of Meta—it was a stand against the commodification of AI talent.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Their decision also reflects a broader shift in tech culture—one where founders and engineers alike are prioritizing purpose, values, and trust over headline-making payouts. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future. She has become a quiet icon of resistance against the centralization of AI power—choosing to innovate outside the usual corporate echo chambers.",Mira Murati is the founder of AI startup Thinking Machines Lab.

‘Bill Gates has no role in toxic food coating’: Michelle Pfeiffer apologises after spreading misinformation; what is the controversy about Apeel’s food coating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-has-no-role-in-toxic-food-coating-michelle-pfeiffer-apologises-after-spreading-misinformation-what-is-the-controversy-about-apeels-food-coating/articleshow/123037875.cms,"Bill Gates’ name wrongly linked to Apeel in viral misinformation

How did Apeel respond

Pfeiffer apologizes and retracts earlier claims

The larger debate on food tech, trust, and responsibility





In July 2025, actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates , was contaminating organic produce. Pfeiffer's posts stated that organic produce ""is no longer safe"" because Apeel's edible plant-based coating, recently approved by the USDA for organic certification, is invisible and ""cannot be washed off. "" She implied a direct connection between Gates and ownership of Apeel. Shortly after, Apeel clarified that Bill Gates has no ownership or involvement in the company beyond two small grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012 and 2015. Pfeiffer later apologized, acknowledging she had shared outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel and its safety.Apeel Sciences, founded in 2012, develops an edible coating made from plant-derived ingredients such as citric acid and baking soda, designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables and reduce food waste. The product, called OrganiPeel, was formally FDA approved in 2024 and has been used in grocery stores since 2017. Apeel received two grants totaling approximately $1.1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates himself is neither a founder, shareholder, nor involved in operations. The company emphasizes its commitment to sustainability and improving food access worldwide.On July 10, 2025, Michelle Pfeiffer shared posts warning her followers that organic produce coated with Apeel was no longer safe to consume, emphasizing the coating's supposed invisibility and inability to wash off.She also posted a list of major grocery chains that do not sell Apeel-coated produce. These claims echoed long-running social media smear campaigns that falsely accused Apeel of contaminating food and overstated Gates's involvement. The misinformation prompted backlash from Apeel, its representatives, and many food safety experts who contested Pfeiffer’s assertions.Apeel representatives firmly denied the allegations related to food safety and company ownership. They stressed that their product is edible, made from responsibly sourced plant oils, and can be removed by simply rinsing and gently scrubbing produce. Apeel also clarified that Bill Gates has ""zero involvement or ownership"" in the company, and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's funding was limited to grants with no controlling influence. The company reaffirmed its transparent mission to reduce food insecurity and improve sustainability in food systems.Three weeks after her initial posts, Pfeiffer returned to social media to issue a public apology. She admitted to unintentionally sharing outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel's product and ownership. Pfeiffer confirmed having spoken directly with Apeel representatives, learning that OrganiPeel is neither a new product nor exclusively linked to Bill Gates. She emphasized the importance of accurate public conversations on food safety and sustainability and expressed regret for spreading misinformation.This incident reflects ongoing tensions and misinformation in public discourse surrounding new food technologies and influential figures like Bill Gates. While some commentators applauded Pfeiffer for raising awareness, others criticized the spread of unverified claims that fuel distrust in science-based innovations. Apeel's case highlights the challenges companies face in balancing transparency, innovation, and public perception amid rapid advances in food technology. Pfeiffer's correction serves as a reminder of the responsibility public figures hold in verifying information before sharing it widely.","Actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates, was contaminating organic produce.

Reddit’s financial earnings



Reddit is all set to make a bold pivot towards becoming a full-fledged search engine. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and AI-powered answers across the platform. The announcement came as part of the company's Q2 2025 shareholder letter, which highlighted strong financial performance driven by advertising and a growing user base. “Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman. The move comes amid explosive growth in Reddit’s internal search usage, which now sees over 70 million weekly queries.During the earnings call, CEO Steve Huffman framed the initiative as a natural evolution for the platform, which has long been the de facto search engine for millions seeking genuine, opinion-based answers. ""For years, people have been adding 'reddit' to their search queries to find real experiences, recommendations, and discussions,"" Huffman stated. ""Our communities are the world's most valuable database of human experience. We're simply building the infrastructure to make that wisdom more accessible and searchable.""Reddit’s pitch is simple: real people, real answers. In a world increasingly dominated by algorithmic summaries, Reddit believes that nuanced, lived experiences are irreplaceable. A recent survey showed that 80% of users trust human responses over AI-generated ones for complex questions.“To focus on the areas that matter most, we are deprioritising a few initiatives, including our work on the user economy. It’s still an opportunity we believe in, but we’re concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs: improving the core product, making Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman.Reddit’s Q2 revenue hit $500 million, up 78% year-over-year, with a net income of $89 million and a gross margin of 90.8%. Advertising revenue alone soared to $465 million, driven by new AI-enhanced ad formats like Conversation Summary Add-ons, which boost clickthrough rates by 10%.With Q3 revenue projected between $535 million and $545 million, Reddit is doubling down on search, deprioritizing other initiatives like its user economy to focus on core product improvements and international growth.","Reddit CEO Steve Huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and AI-powered answers across the platform.

"After SC judgment, mental well being no longer charity but constitutional right: Experts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-sc-judgment-mental-well-being-no-longer-charity-but-constitutional-right-experts/articleshow/123071741.cms,"KOLKATA: Mental health activists and experts have welcomed the Supreme Court's explicit recognition of mental health as an integral part of the constitutional Right to Life under Article 21.They say this broadens the interpretation of the right to life to include psychological well-being, not just physical survival. The Supreme Court recognised the right to mental health as an integral component of the right to life under Article 21 while laying down binding guidelines for educational institutions and coaching centres across India.The observation was made in a case related to the death of a 17-year-old student undergoing coaching for the National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test (NEET) examination. The apex court set aside orders of the Andhra Pradesh High Court to allow the transfer of the investigation into the death under suspicious circumstances to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Mental health activist Ratnaboli Ray, who is the founder of Anjali, a rights-based organisation, said the apex court order moves mental health from the realm of welfare or charity into the domain of legal and constitutional rights.""This means that the state and institutions are no longer simply encouraged but obligated to ensure mental health protections as part of their duty under the Constitution,"" said Ray, a psychologist by training.Ray also pointed out that by issuing guidelines for students' welfare in the context of mental health, the court has acknowledged the growing mental health crisis in educational spaces—ranging from anxiety and depression to suicide. This makes schools and universities potentially accountable for creating psychologically safe environments. ""The court order represents a cultural shift. When the Supreme Court validates mental health as a constitutional concern, it plays a critical role in destigmatising mental illness, legitimising lived experiences, and encouraging both care-seeking and policy action,"" she said.Advocate Arush Sengupta pointed out that embedding mental health under Article 21 makes it justiciable. ""If someone’s right to mental well-being is violated—for example, through institutional neglect, discrimination, or lack of access to care—they can now take legal recourse based on constitutional grounds. This also strengthens the implementation of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, which already defines access to mental health services as a right, but until now lacked the direct constitutional force to ensure consistent and widespread enforcement,"" he said.Psychiatrist Aniruddha Deb felt the ruling has the potential to transform institutional accountability, public funding, and societal attitudes in India. ""This is a landmark judgment. Till now, mental illness was perceived as a disability, a dysfunction and looked down upon. Treatment and care were neglected as were rights. People with mental illness were relegated to second-class citizens. They were even denied the right to vote. Being of unsound mind precluded them from holding any office. All that will change now. The moment you equate the right to mental health with the right to life, the whole observation changes,"" said Deb.Ray added that the moment demands bold, rights-affirming governance, not piecemeal or tokenistic gestures. ""The judiciary has spoken. It is now the executive’s responsibility to institutionalize this vision into everyday governance so that mental health is not only constitutionally protected, but meaningfully lived,"" she added.What SC judgment does* Broadens the interpretation of the right to life to include psychological well-being, not just physical survival* Moves mental health from the realm of welfare or charity into the domain of legal and constitutional rights. State and institutions are no longer simply encouraged but obligated to ensure mental health protections* Schools and universities potentially accountable for creating psychologically safe environments* Embedding mental health under Article 21 makes it justiciable. If someone’s right to mental well-being is violated, they can now take legal recourse based on constitutional grounds* Strengthens the implementation of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017,* To play a critical role in destigmatizing mental illness, legitimizing lived experiences, and encouraging care-seeking and policy action",Supreme Court recognised right to mental health as an integral component of the right to life under Article 21. The observation was made in a case related to the death of a 17-year-old student undergoing coaching for the National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test (NEET),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123071864,imgsize-161204,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/123071864.jpg"
Vets: Licensing of pets critical to monitoring public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/vets-licensing-of-pets-critical-to-monitoring-public-health/articleshow/123071870.cms,"Representative Image

Mumbai: With 2,629 licenced dogs, city's K-West ward, which includes areas such as Juhu, Lokhandwala and Oshiwara in Andheri West, emerged as the top neighbourhood for responsible pet ownership, revealed data from the BMC.""We seek very basic details when pet owners apply for a license, like details of the dog, veterinary doctor, date of recent rabies and leptospirosis vaccinations, whether adopted, purchased, or transferred. Once the details are submitted, the application is sent to the concerned BMC office for scrutiny, and once the same is approved, which happens within seven days, the applicant will get an approval email on the registered email address. ""Veterinarians say they routinely raise the issue with dog owners during first consultations, stressing the importance of licensing as a way to ensure dogs are vaccinated, breeds are recorded, and that the BMC has a better understanding of the city's pet population - critical for public health monitoring and planning. Dr Priti Sathe, a veterinarian based in Vikhroli, said there is a noticeable rise in awareness about pet licenses among dog owners compared to previous years.""Many pet parents now proactively ask about it during their visit,"" she said. However, she stressed the need for the BMC to extend the licensing system to cats as well, citing the city's growing population of pet owners.Dr Pathan confirmed that the process to include cats under the licensing framework is already underway. Besides, he also said that plans are afoot for having a dedicated number for citizens to call and seek any assistance related to pet or stray animals. ""Currently, citizens call the civic disaster control room number 1916 with all queries, but then such a dedicated number will help better track any issues related to pets or stray animals,"" said Dr Pathan.Pawan Sharma, Founder and President of RAWW (Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare) and Member of the Committee to Monitor Animal Welfare Laws in Maharashtra, constituted by Bombay High Court and Govt of Maharashtra, pointed at the increasing instances of smuggling of exotic pets such as birds, reptiles, and fish - many of which are frequently seized at Mumbai airport - and hence said that it's more important that the civic body must start regulating cats and other non-canine pets. ""Pet ownership is no longer limited to just dogs.

India faces $9–11 billion oil bill spike: Pivot from Russian crude after Trump's 'penalty' could hit margins- What analysts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-faces-911-billion-oil-bill-spike-forced-pivot-from-russian-crude-after-trumps-penalty-could-hit-margins-analysts-warn-of-inflation-risks/articleshow/123071591.cms,"AI-image

India continuing to buy oil from Russia: Report

As US President Donald Trump announced penalties on India in addition to a 25 per cent tariff- citing, in part, India’s trade ties with Russia- analysts warn the moving away could come at a significant cost. According to estimates, India’s import bill could rise by $9–11 billion if it is forced to pivot away from Russian oil.""Financially, the implications are substantial. If a USD 5 per barrel discount is lost across 1.8 million barrels per day, India's import bill could increase by USD 9–11 billion annually. If global prices rise further due to reduced Russian supply, the cost could be even higher,"" as stated in the report by global real-time data and analytics firm Kpler, cited by PTI.Coming within days of the European Union banning imports of refined products derived from Russian-origin crude, this presents a double blow for Indian refiners.Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst (Refining & Modelling) at Kpler, termed this as ""a squeeze from both ends"".EU sanctions, effective from January 2026, may force Indian refiners to segment crude intake on one side. On the other, the US tariff threat raises the possibility of secondary sanctions that would directly hit the shipping, insurance, and financing lifelines underpinning India's Russian oil trade.""Together, these measures sharply curtail India's crude procurement flexibility, raise compliance risk, and introduce significant cost uncertainty,"" further said Ritolia, as quoted by PTI.Last fiscal, India spent over Rs 1.14 lakh crore on the import of crude oil, which is refined into fuels like petrol and diesel.India, as the world's third-largest oil consumer and importer, has significantly benefited from quickly replacing market-priced oil with discounted Russian crude. This shift came after Western sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Before the conflict, Russian oil constituted less than 0.2% of India's imports. However, it now represents 35-40% of the country's crude intake. This change has helped India reduce overall energy import costs, stabilize retail fuel prices, and manage inflation.Also read: India’s US crude oil imports surge over 50% in first half of 2025; LNG, LPG trade also expands- Report The availability of discounted Russian crude has also allowed India to refine the oil and export petroleum products, even to countries that have imposed sanctions on direct imports from Russia. This dual strategy has led Indian oil companies to achieve record profits.For refiners such as Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy, which together are responsible for more than 50 per cent of the 1.7–2.0 million barrels per day of Russian crude imports into India by 2025, the situation presents significant challenges. Nayara, supported by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, recently faced sanctions from the EU, while Reliance has been a major exporter of fuel to Europe. As one of the leading diesel exporters globally, Reliance has capitalized on discounted Russian crude to enhance its refining margins over the past two years. In 2024, their total refined product exports to Europe averaged around 200,000 barrels per day, and in 2025, they have averaged 185,000 barrels per day, according to data from Kpler, cited by PTI.Reliance's dual-refinery setup, consisting of a domestic-focused unit and an export-oriented complex, provides strategic adaptability. This allows the company to direct non-Russian crude to its export-oriented refinery, ensuring compliance with EU standards, while processing Russian oil at the domestic unit for other markets.While it is operationally possible to redirect diesel exports to regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, or Latin America, such a move would result in narrower profit margins, longer shipping times, and increased demand variability, making it less commercially attractive.Private refiners, who process over half of the Russian crude imports, have started to reduce their reliance on Russian oil. This week, they are diversifying their procurement sources due to growing concerns about potential US sanctions.Ritolia noted that replacing Russian crude is not straightforward. The Middle East is a logical alternative, but it presents challenges such as contractual commitments, rigid pricing, and differences in crude quality that can affect product yield and refinery operations. ""The risk extends beyond supply to profitability. Refiners will face higher feedstock costs, and for complex units optimized for blends similar to Russian Urals, profit margins could be under pressure,"" he explained.Looking ahead, Kpler anticipates that India's complex private refiners, supported by strong trading capabilities and adaptable configurations, will gradually shift towards non-Russian crude from regions like the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America, or even the US, where it is economically viable.This transition, while operationally possible, will be gradual and strategically aligned with changing regulatory frameworks, contract structures, and margin dynamics.However, completely replacing Russian oil is a significant challenge- logistically complex, economically burdensome, and geopolitically sensitive. While supply substitution may seem feasible on paper, it is fraught with practical difficulties.This would place additional fiscal pressure, especially if the government intervenes to stabilize retail fuel prices. The resulting impact on inflation, currency, and monetary policy would be significant and challenging to overlook.Just days after the tariff announcement, Trump claimed he had “heard” that India was no longer going to buy oil from Russia, calling it “a good step” while speaking to reporters on Friday. However, government sources have reprotedly firmly refuted this, saying Indian oil refiners continue to purchase crude from Russian suppliers.“Indian oil refiners continue to source oil from Russian suppliers. Their supply decisions are guided by price, grade of crude, inventories, logistics, and other economic factors,” sources were quoted as saying by ANI.They also noted that Russia, as the world’s second-largest crude producer and exporter, remains a key player in global energy markets. In this context, India- being the third-largest energy consumer with 85 per cent import dependency- has adjusted its sourcing strategy to ensure affordable and secure energy access while complying with international norms.Read more: India continuing to buy oil from Russia- Report rebuts Donald Trump's 'good steps' claim","India's import bill could rise by $9–11 billion if it is forced to pivot away from Russian oil.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
