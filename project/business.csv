Revival instinct: ‘Little Europe’ clings to last vestiges of its heritage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/revival-instinct-little-europe-clings-to-last-vestiges-of-its-heritage/articleshow/110258944.cms,"KOLKATA: Much before the British founded Calcutta (now Kolkata), “Little Europe” had already started taking shape in pockets of Gangetic Bengal.The first European colony in Bengal was established by the Portuguese in Bandel on the Ganges riverbank in the early 16th century. The Dutch followed in Chinsurah, the French in Chandannagar (formerly Chandernagore), the British in Calcutta and, finally, the Danes in Serampore.These former colonial enclaves, which are now part of the Serampore and Hooghly parliamentary constituencies, will vote today.The approximately 20 lakh electors in these seats want their representatives and both state and central govts to revive tourism, restore the architectural relics, preserve their heritage and renew trade and commerce.The towns, roughly 60km north of Kolkata, started flourishing in trade and commerce and witnessed an influx of capital, becoming home to some of the biggest riverine ports . The foreign rulers also brought in their cuisine, culture and architecture and constructed churches and mansions.With Kolkata acquiring more significance under the British in the 18th century, the “Little Europe” settlements were relegated to the background as their magnificent architectural heritage began crumbling and their cuisine disappeared and trade dwindled.“These places have been reduced to being mofussil (suburban) towns that are bursting at the seams. The state of infrastructure is abysmal, the drainage system is a mess and unplanned real estate development has affected the quality of living,” said Soumen Banerjee, a former English professor at Serampore College, which was built in 1827.The locals feel the areas have great potential for tourism by virtue of their tangible and intangible heritage.“These towns have been holding on to traces of their European heritage in public spaces, buildings and culture. The colonial architecture , cultural practices and memories in “Little Europe” are now at risk due to rapid urbanisation. They need urgent conservation measures and a solid revival plan,” said Susmita Mukherjee, who runs a café in Bandel.West Bengal Tourism is promoting these areas along the Hooghly and showcasing the settlements of European traders around its banks.To preserve and document the heritage, UK and India have jointly funded The Hugli River of Cultures Project.A team of academic researchers, who reside in and around Chandannagar, and partner teams from the University of Liverpool and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, are collaborating on the project.“Several monuments, including churches and public spaces, have already been restored. The number of tourists visiting these places has also risen,” said an official of the tourism department.Restoration of The Denmark Tavern, using traditional construction techniques and materials, has not only drawn tourists and spurred public interest but also rekindled hopes for the restoration of other heritage monuments in a way that benefits the local economy. The tavern, dating back to the 1780s, served as a hangout offering drinks, books and recreational activities to European visitors.“The restoration of the Danish tavern can be used as an example for other places of historical importance,” said Anirban Ghosh, who conducts heritage walks in various areas of “Little Europe”.","The first European colony in Bengal was established by the Portuguese in Bandel on the Ganges riverbank in the early 16th century.

As on Saturday, purchase of the foodgrain was around 261 lakh tonnes and daily arrival now is about 70,000-80,000 tonnes. Madhya Pradesh , where govt purchase has been nearly 33% less than the procurement last year, has extended the procurement period to May 31.However, Punjab and Haryana recorded higher purchases than last year of 124 lakh tonnes and 71.4 lakh tonnes respectively.Food Corporation of India (FCI) officials said they were confident of total procurement touching 270 lakh tonnes against earlier estimate of 300-310 lakh tonnes, which was arrived at after consultation with states.""The current level of procurement and the stock that we have will be more than enough to meet the food security requirement of providing free foodgrain to 80 crore poor under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojna and other welfare schemes.

The state won't be able to achieve the initial target of 80 lakh tonnes.Though there has been a more than four-fold jump in wheat procurement in Uttar Pradesh and 2.5 times in Rajasthan, their contribution to the central pool is hardly 18 lakh tonnes. Govt had expected procurement of around 50 lakh tonnes of wheat from UP, Rajasthan and Bihar. Officials said the procurement period in UP is likely to be extended till June so that more farmers can get the benefit of MSP.Sources said with the current level of procurement, there is hardly any scope for govt to lift the restriction on wheat export this year as well. It also remains to be seen whether the Centre will restore the wheat-rice ratio as it was before May 2022. Govt had changed the policy to allocate more rice instead of wheat following a drastic reduction in foodgrain procurement in 2022 due to lower production and record exports that year.",Wheat procurement by govt agencies this year is set to cross last year's figure of 262 lakh tonnes in the next couple of days.

Schengen visa delays: Indian holidaymakers are increasingly opting for alternative destinations like Georgia , Australia, and Japan due to the persistent Schengen visa appointment delays over the past three years, according to industry executives. These countries have simplified their visa processes for Indian travellers, making them more attractive options for summer vacations.Georgia's e-visa facility has been particularly popular, with Thomas Cook (India) reporting a remarkable 600% year-on-year increase in demand for the country.As a result, the travel company has doubled departures in several of its group series to accommodate the growing interest, according to an ET report.Rajeev Kale, president of holidays at Thomas Cook (India), noted that ""In combination with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan are also witnessing a significant uptick (around 400%), and we've coupled them with Georgia while also offering standalone options."" He added, ""Locales like Tashkent, Samarkand (Uzbekistan) and Almaty (Kazakhstan) have also witnessed a strong growth of approximately 300% year-on-year.""Indian nationals can obtain e-visas for Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan, while Kazakhstan allows visa-free stays for up to 14 days. The ongoing delays in visa appointments for some Schengen countries, which have been reported by ET since April 24, have contributed to the shift in Indian travellers' preferences towards these alternative destinations.MakeMyTrip has observed a significant 57% increase in searches for Japan during the summer season compared to the previous year, according to Saujanya Shrivastava, the company's chief operating officer for flights, holidays and Gulf. ""Among the top cities within Japan, Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Nagoya are of higher interest, with Tokyo alone accounting for two-thirds of all hotel searches and 80% of all flight searches,"" he said.Agoda CEO Omri Morgenshtern, during his recent visit to India, discussed the impact of relaxed visa policies on travel. ""When the visa process is easy and when the flight capacity is there, we see travel increasing. It's a business of removing friction,"" he said, citing the example of Bangkok, which became the most sought-after destination for Indians on Agoda after Thailand introduced a visa waiver.Recently, Thailand announced an extension of the temporary visa exemption for Indian nationals until November 11, to further boost tourism.Yatra Online is experiencing a substantial number of last-minute bookings for international destinations, including Thailand, Vietnam, Mauritius, Singapore, Bali, and Sri Lanka, according to Bharatt Malik, senior vice president for flights and hotel business at the travel firm. Additionally, he mentioned, ""We have seen a 100% increase in bookings to Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan compared to pre-Covid levels.""Cleartrip's top international destinations for Indian travelers are Bangkok, Dubai, and Singapore, says Gaurav Patwari, vice president for the air category at the company.Also Read | Planning to buy a house in Delhi-NCR?

Bet big on fintech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/bet-big-on-fintech/articleshow/110258751.cms,"Chennai has a long history of banking , insurance, nonbanking finance and even chit funds. The Madras Bank, which was subsequently merged with SBI, was established in 1682. Madras Urban Cooperative Bank, India’s first cooperative bank, was established in 1906. The country’s first private mutual fund was launched in the city in 1993.The city is a competitive hub for technology and several IT majors have established themselves in the BFSI services sector.But when it comes to marrying finance and technology, Chennai lags behind Mumbai and even the emerging GIFT City in Gujarat.“Chennai offers a fantastic ecosystem for fintech. It is home to some pioneering banks and NBFCs and has always had a robust pool of technology talent in BFSI,” says Venkat Subramanyam, founder, Veda Corporate Advisors, a leading investment bank. “This fusion of finance and technology skills should ideally place Chennai at the forefront of fintech action. Hopefully, we will see more successes going forward,” he adds.As a first step, the state govt unveiled an exclusive FinTech Policy in Nov 2021. Its key objective is to develop infrastructure for attracting next generation fintech firms.“The financial services space is changing rapidly. Banks such as IDFC First Bank and JP Morgan increasingly see themselves as technology companies with a banking licence,” says Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a technology growth advisory firm.“Likewise, born-digital companies such as Google and Alibaba, also called techfin companies, are into financial services in a big way. The distinction between traditional financial services players, NBFCs, fintech and techfin companies will gradually blur and we will see increasing collaboration and crosspollination,” he adds.“Recognizing this, TN’s fintech policy covers all categories of financial services companies that have technology as their underlying platform for business as well as those that are building the technology platform ecosystem,” says Ramamoorthy.“I expect not only fintech unicorns from Tamil Nadu such as Yubi (formerly CredAvenue) to multiply but also well-established financial services players -ecosystem and platform builders such as M2P Fintech and Kaleidofin, infrastructure providers such as FSS, and incubators such as FinBlue -to play a meaningful role in tech-enabled financial services,” he adds.In Jan last, TN launched FinTech City, a project spread over 56 acres, that will offer developed plots for financial institutions to establish base, with commercial and residential space. It will also have a FinTech Tower with 5.6 lakh sqft of developed space for fintech startups and BFSI companies.“State govt is slightly late with fintech focus. No one has marketed or spoken much about FinTech City. They could have identified and built smaller infrastructure instead of waiting for the larger project. If they wait for construction to complete, they will miss the bus,” says T R Suresh, General Partner, July Ventures, a venture capital fund.“Chennai has the technology and knowledge base for this sector and it is already the SaaS capital. But financial services are highly regularised. If institutions already in core functions join hands with companies focused on innovation, the products will be perfect in terms of compliance,” says Suresh.“It is not too late for developing anything, especially infrastructure. Unlike other states, FinTech City is coming up well within city limits and in line with the upcoming metro rail corridor,” says Sandeep Nanduri, managing director of state-owned Tidco, which is promoting the project.“We are developing it in two phases to offer infrastructure support to enable the growth of fintech companies. While the FinTech Tower is under construction, we are also offering developed plots on auction for financial institutions (FIs) to establish their own bases,” he says.Recently two plots were auctioned and two FIs successfully bid for them. Since the Model Code of Conduct is in force, formal agreements will be signed after the first week of June.","Chennai has a long history of banking, insurance, nonbanking finance and even chit funds.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

He was part of the elite crew for Blue Origin ’s New Shepard-25 (NS-25) mission, which took off from the company’s West Texas launch site in the US around 8:05 pm (IST), an hour late from its scheduled launch time of 9:35 am (local US time).Born in Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh), Gopi, an entrepreneur and a pilot, journeyed to the edge of space beyond the Earth’s atmosphere along with five others — Ed Dwight, Mason Angel, Sylvain Chiron, Kenneth L Hess and Carol Schaller. Ed Dwight (90) is now the oldest man on Earth to go to space.Gopi has retained his Indian passport despite working in the US. Although he became the first Indian citizen to go to space as a tourist, he is officially the second astronaut from the country after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma, who flew as a professional cosmonaut to space on board Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme. Astronauts Kalpana Chawla, Sunita Williams, Raja Chari, and Sirisha Bandla were all US citizens of Indian origin who also went to space as professional astronauts. TOI had earlier reported on Gopi’s probable entry to the elite astronaut club.Following takeoff, the NS-25 vehicle reached beyond the boundary of space smoothly. The rocket and capsule then returned to Earth, with the rocket landing upright a few minutes after takeoff. The capsule successfully touched down, using two of its three parachutes, roughly 15 minutes after takeoff. It was Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin’s first crew launch in nearly two years. “Capsule touchdown. Welcome back, NS25 crew!” Blue Origin said in a post on X.Introducing the Indian space tourist , a Blue Origin statement said, “Gopi Thotakura is a lifelong pilot and aviator who learned how to fly before he could drive. He flies jets commercially, in addition to piloting bush, aerobatic, and seaplanes. Gopi is a co-founder of Preserve Life Corp, a global center for holistic wellness and applied health located near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.”He studied for a BSc in aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, US. A trained pilot, Gopi had worked in medical air evacuation services in India in the past. “A lifelong traveller, his most recent adventure took him to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro,” the statement said.In another first, America’s first Black astronaut candidate, Ed Dwight, finally rocketed into space 60 years later. Dwight, a former Air Force captain who was selected in 1961 but never got to fly to space with NASA, finally reached the edge of space — at 90 years, 8 months, and 10 days. He thus became the oldest person to go to space, narrowly surpassing Star Trek actor William Shatner, who was almost two months younger when he launched with Blue Origin in 2021.This flight is Blue Origin’s first tourist mission on New Shepard since August 2022. The company was forced to halt flights of the rocket after a New Shepard vehicle suffered an engine failure mid-flight during an uncrewed mission in Sep 2022. Blue Origin spent most of 2023 investigating the failure and making design corrections, and the company successfully returned to flight with another uncrewed mission in Dec.This mission was the seventh human flight for the New Shepard programme and the 25th in its history. Earlier, Blue Origin launched six tourist missions, flying celebrities like William Shatner, Michael Strahan, and Bezos himself to space. In all, New Shepard has flown 31 humans above the internationally recognized boundary of space, the company said.The company, seen as a future key strategic rival to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, plans to debut a much larger and more powerful New Glenn rocket later this year, capable of launching cargo to orbit. Blue Origin also aims to send humans to the moon later this decade for NASA.","India-born Gopi Thotakura made history on Sunday evening as he became the first Indian citizen to venture into space as a tourist.

"Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns of 40% risk of civil war in US, jokes about Taylor Swift for President",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/billionaire-investor-ray-dalio-warns-of-40-risk-of-civil-war-in-us-jokes-about-taylor-swift-for-president/articleshow/110251376.cms,"A surprising endorsement

NEW DELHI: Renowned investor and billionaire Ray Dalio has raised alarms about the escalating political divisions in the United States , warning that the probability of a civil war could be as high as 40%. Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates , the world's largest hedge fund, made these remarks in a recent interview with the Financial Times, saying, ""We are now on the brink,"" and foreseeing ""much more turbulent times"" ahead.Dalio has long been vocal about his concerns regarding the political and economic instability in the US. He has repeatedly highlighted the dangers posed by extreme levels of government debt, significant wealth inequality, rising internal divisions, and ongoing external conflicts. According to Dalio, these factors can lead to war, revolution, and a new world order.In his latest prediction, Dalio pegged the chances of a civil war at 35% to 40%, though he clarified that this might not necessarily entail a shooting war. The financial historian has been warning about these risks for years. In late 2020, he cautioned that the US was ""seeing a form of civil war"" as people moved between states for political and tax-related reasons. By early 2021, he lamented that America was in a ""terrible financial state and terribly divided.""Dalio's concerns are not limited to domestic issues. After the Israel-Hamas conflict erupted in October, he declared that the risk of a world war involving the US and China had surged from 35% to about 50%.In a surprising twist, Dalio half-jokingly suggested that pop star Taylor Swift could be the solution to America's divisions. After attending one of Swift's concerts, he remarked on her ability to bring together people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities. ""I saw how she brought people of all sorts — and many nationalities — together,"" he said. ""I say this partly as a joke, but if she ran for president and would listen to great advisers, I'd consider supporting her.""Dalio revealed his admiration for Swift when he posted a selfie from one of her ""Eras Tour"" concerts in March. Although he later clarified in a follow-up post that he was joking about endorsing her for president, he emphasized that ""she can bring people together a lot better than either of the presidential candidates.""Even if Dalio was just having fun with his talk of a Taylor Swift presidency, his comments reflect a serious recognition of the need for a unifying leader at a time when the world is on edge and people seem further apart than ever.","Billionaire Ray Dalio has raised alarms about the escalating political divisions in the United States.

Fresh corruption allegations levelled against ex-Pak PM Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fresh-corruption-allegations-levelled-against-ex-pak-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/110249925.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's accountability watchdog has levelled fresh corruption allegations against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accusing him of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts linked to the state gift repository when he was in power, media reports said on Sunday. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

Pakistan government forecasts USD 72 bn investment needed to meet 50 pc surge in power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forecasts-usd-72-bn-investment-needed-to-meet-50-pc-surge-in-power-demand/articleshow/110249530.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a comprehensive overview of Pakistan's energy landscape, the government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade. This forecast, outlined in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2024-34) submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), aims to bolster the country's power infrastructure to meet escalating demand, Dawn reported.Under the proposed plan, renewable energy sources are slated to account for a significant portion, with an expected surge to 46 per cent of the total energy mix within the next decade.This surge in capacity, estimated to rise from 42,000MW to 57,000MW, underscores the government's commitment to embracing sustainable energy solutions .The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has provided insights into the anticipated growth in electricity demand, projecting increases ranging from 46 per cent under a low-growth scenario to 74 per cent in a high-growth scenario over the next ten years. To accommodate this surge, an estimated investment of USD 62-64 billion would be required, reflecting the scale of the challenge at hand, as reported by Dawn.The Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP 2024-34) outlines an additional USD 8.7 billion investment imperative for enhancing the transmission network. This allocation includes funds for both ongoing projects, requiring USD 3.2 billion for completion, and new projects necessitating USD 5.5 billion in funding.Employing state-of-the-art generation planning software, PLEXOS, the least-cost, long-term generation expansion plan has been meticulously developed. This plan factors in existing and future generation projects, policy frameworks, contractual obligations, natural resource allocations, and prevailing Grid Code provisions. It adheres closely to the National Electricity Policy 2021 and incorporates a series of assumptions to guide strategic decision-making.In crafting the base case scenario, NTDC has meticulously accounted for existing contractual obligations and projected retirements of power projects as stipulated in their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), with the exception of KAPCO. The plan also factors in the retirement of 8,330MW of existing power generation capacity over the planning horizon.The forecasted demand is calibrated to accommodate the intermittency of variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar PV, critical elements in achieving the government's ambitious renewable energy targets. With an estimated 87,600 hours of energy and peak demand forecasted from FY24 to 34, the plan aims to balance the evolving energy landscape with a diversified and resilient energy mix.By 2034, the envisioned energy mix will reflect a notable shift towards indigenous fuel sources, with local coal and renewables playing a prominent role. Hydropower is expected to contribute 46 per cent of the energy mix, accompanied by 10 per cent from variable renewable energy sources. The plan minimizes reliance on imported fuels, with RFO making no contribution and imported coal and RLNG accounting for a modest share of total energy requirements, Dawn reported.","The government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade.

Prachanda, 69, a former guerilla leader, belongs to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives (HoR).He will seek a vote of confidence in Parliament, the fourth within 18 months of taking office, amidst obstruction of the House proceedings by the Opposition Nepali Congress demanding a probe into the alleged involvement of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane in the misappropriation of cooperative funds.""There is no doubt that my government will survive the floor test,"" Prime Minister Prachanda said at a ruling party's programme in Kathmandu on Saturday.""The differences between the ruling alliance and opposition parties will be sorted out through dialogue,"" he said.The Prime Minister is required to take a vote of confidence within 30 days if the party the Prime Minister is representing splits or if a member of the coalition government withdraws support.

LONDON: The final report of the UK 's infected blood inquiry will be published Monday, nearly six years after it began looking into how tens of thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis from transfusions of tainted blood and blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. The scandal is widely seen as the deadliest to afflict Britain's state-run National Health Service since its inception in 1948, with around 3,000 people believed to have died as a result of being infected with the HIV virus and hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver.The report is expected to criticise pharmaceutical firms and medical practitioners, civil servants and politicians, though many have already died given the passage of time.It's also set to pave the way to a huge compensation bill that the British government will be under pressure to rapidly pay out.Had it not been for the tireless campaigners, many of whom saw loved ones die decades too soon, the scale of the scandal may have remained hidden forever.""This whole scandal has blanketed my entire life,"" said Jason Evans, who was four when his father died at the age of 31 in 1993 after contracting HIV and hepatitis from an infected blood plasma product.""My dad knew he was dying and he took many home videos, which I've got and replayed over and over again growing up because that's really all I had,"" he added.Evans was instrumental in the decision by then Prime Minister Theresa May to establish the inquiry in 2017. He said he just ""couldn't let it go."" His hope is that on Monday, he and countless others, can.Here is a look at what the scandal was about and what the report's impact may be.In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of people who needed blood transfusions, for example after childbirth or surgery, became exposed to blood tainted with hepatitis, including an as yet unknown kind that was later termed Hepatitis C, and the HIV virus.Those with haemophilia, a condition affecting the blood's ability to clot, became exposed to what was sold as a revolutionary new treatment derived from blood plasma.In the UK, the NHS, which treats the vast majority of people, started using the new treatment in the early 1970s. It was called Factor VIII. It was more convenient when compared with an alternative treatment and was dubbed a wonder drug.Demand soon outstripped domestic sources of supply, so health officials began importing Factor VIII from the US, where a high proportion of plasma donations came from prisoners and drug users who were paid to donate blood.That dramatically raised the risk of the plasma being contaminated.Factor VIII was made by mixing plasma from thousands of donations. In this pooling, one infected donor would compromise the whole batch.The inquiry heard estimates that more than 30,000 people were infected from compromised blood or blood products via transfusions or Factor VIII.By the mid 1970s, there was evidence haemophiliacs being treated with Factor VIII were more prone to hepatitis. The World Health Organisation, which had warned in 1953 of the hepatitis risks associated with the mass pooling of plasma products, urged countries not to import plasma.AIDS, the biggest public health crisis since World War II, turned up in the early 1980s. Originally thought to be isolated to the gay community, it soon started appearing among haemophiliacs and those who had received blood transfusions.Though the cause of AIDS - HIV - was not identified until 1983, warnings had been relayed to the UK government the year before that the causative agent could be transmitted by blood products.The government argued there was no conclusive proof. Patients were not informed of the risk, and persisted with a treatment that put them in mortal danger.The inquiry is expected to conclude that lessons from as early as the 1940s had been ignored.Campaigners argue that since the 1940s it had been clear that heat killed hepatitis in another plasma product, Albumin. They say authorities could have made Factor VIII safe before it was sold.Evidence given to the inquiry suggested that authorities' main objection was financial. Non-heated Factor VIII was prescribed by the NHS until late 1985.Campaigners hope the inquiry's core finding is that Factor VIII concentrates should never have been licensed for use unless heated.In the late 1980s, victims and their families called for compensation on the grounds of medical negligence.Though the government set up a charity to make one-off support payments to those infected with HIV in the early 1990s, it did not admit liability or responsibility and victims were pressured to sign a waiver undertaking not to sue the Department of Health to get the money.Crucially, the waiver also prevented victims from suing for hepatitis, even though at that stage they only knew about their HIV infection. Years after signing, victims were told they had also been infected with hepatitis, mainly Hepatitis C.There was no further group litigation until Evans, whose mother ""crumbled"" after his father's death and who was called ""AIDS boy"" at school, brought a case claiming misfeasance in public office against the Department of Health.Combined with political and media pressure, May announced the independent inquiry. It was, she said, ""an appalling tragedy which should simply never have happened.""The government has accepted the case for compensation, with most estimates putting the final bill in the region of 10 billion pounds (USD 12.7 billion).In October 2022, authorities made interim payments of 100,000 pounds to each survivor and bereaved partners.The government is expected to announce different payments for different infections and also address how and when bereaved families can apply for interim payments on behalf of the estates of people who have died.",The final report of the UK's infected blood inquiry will be published Monday. Tens of thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis from transfusions of tainted blood. The scandal is widely seen as the deadliest to afflict Britain's state-run National Health Service.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110248235,imgsize-79606,width-400,resizemode-4/110248235.jpg"

The disconnect between the problem solvers and problem sufferers is a serious question mark. Education ministers and the education sector can play a leadership role in ensuring that our children can develop compassionate intelligence and mitigate growing divides and discriminatory practices,” he said.At the education conference which concludes on Friday, officials will exchange ideas about tackling uncertainties in education financing, explore partnerships, and discuss commitments and reforms. They will assess the current state of the education sector while creating a roadmap for accelerated progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4 of equitable and quality education.

NEW DELHI: A newly unveiled portrait of King Charles III has drawn vivid and varied reactions, with some viewers suggesting the depiction looks as though ""he’s bathing in blood."" The large-scale painting , measuring 2.6 by 2 meters, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Drapers and will be displayed in the Drapers’ Hall gallery in downtown London .The portrait, created by a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery who has previously painted prominent royal figures, including Queen Camilla and the late Prince Philip, reflects a more controversial image of the monarch. The artist, Jonathan Yeo, mentioned that King Charles participated actively in the portrait's conceptual phase, even suggesting the inclusion of a butterfly on his shoulder to symbolize his environmental advocacy and his transformative journey to the throne, a South China Morning Post report said.""Much like the butterfly I've painted hovering over his shoulder, this portrait has evolved as the subject's role in our public life has transformed,"" Yeo, 53, who has previously painted Charles' late father Prince Philip, said in a statement.""My aim was also to make reference to the traditions of Royal portraiture but in a way that reflects a 21st Century Monarchy and, above all else, to communicate the subject's deep humanity.""Despite King Charles's involvement, he was ""initially surprised by the strong color,"" Yeo revealed to the BBC. When the portrait was unveiled, the king appeared to react sharply to the vivid portrayal. The piece has also stirred online discussions, drawing references to the royal family’s controversial historical actions and personal scandals.Some social media users drew humorous comparisons to the ""Ghostbusters"" villain, Vigo the Carpathian. Critical comments on platforms like Instagram included descriptions of the portrait as making Charles appear ""like he's in hell"" or ""bathing in blood.""Queen Camilla, however, had a positive view of the portrayal, reportedly saying, “Yes, you’ve got him,” upon seeing the painting for the first time.The portrait was commissioned to celebrate Charles' 50 years as a member of the Drapers’ Company, which was set up more than 600 years ago as a trade association for wool merchants.Philanthropy came to be part of their mission and the company is now a grant-giving body.","A portrait of King Charles III has been unveiled in London.

The employers are using serviced office desks so they hardly are there, and when they do turn up they say: ‘We will let you know’. And they never get a response. They are left with no jobs and no money and are crying in front of us. Someare getting deportation notices. Around a month ago people started coming to us and we realised this is a grave problem. These people have not committed any crime and are being deported.”The NCGO estimates around 2,500 Indians, of which 1,300 are Gujarati, are affected.Those who have received deportation notices have been told if they can find a job in a similar field with a new employer who holds a licence in 60 days, they can stay. But Nagda said hardly any managed this as “there aren’t that many jobs”.The five from Gujarat are men and women, aged 22 and 40, who came in the last six months to work in the care system and ended up with bogus employers who don’t have work — in London, Oxford and Bristol. They paid agents in Gujarat from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 18 lakh to get the work permit. Two of the five have received deportation notices as their sponsors have been stripped of their licences by the home office.“Their families have complained to the agents in India and they say, ‘We promised to send you to the UK, you are in the UK’,” Nagda said.They are borrowing money from friends and family to survive. If they take a job in another field, it would be illegal and they cannot claim state benefits, he said.Indians are the largest cohort coming to the UK on care visas. A report by the independent chief inspector of borders published in March exposed how 275 certificates of sponsorship were granted to a care home which did not exist and 1,234 certificates were granted to a company that only had four employees.",The National Council of Gujarati Organisations (UK) is representing five cases. It says there are thousands more with many too scared to come forward. The migrants paid huge fees to agents in India to find the care company that sponsored their visa does not exist or has no work.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110156681,imgsize-605410,width-400,resizemode-4/110156681.jpg"

Analysis of resilience

Russia’s economic performance

NEW DELHI: A recent study by the Sino-Russian Laboratory for Assessing the Consequences of Intercountry Trade Wars has revealed that the British, German, and French economies would be significantly impacted if their trade ties were cut off without the possibility of parallel imports. In contrast, the US, Russian, and Chinese economies could withstand a full trade blockade with relatively minimal damage.The research, conducted in early 2024 at China’s National Supercomputing Center, tested the resilience of 19 global economies to large-scale economic sanctions using mathematical modeling.Analysts assessed the direct gross domestic product (GDP) losses each country would suffer if faced with a complete trade blockade without the option of parallel imports, a Russia Today report said.The study revealed that while all countries would see economic contraction under such a scenario, some would be hit harder than others. The German economy would be the worst affected, contracting by 8.1%. Other significantly impacted economies include South Korea (down by 7.9%), Mexico (7.2%), France (7%), Türkiye (6.6%), Italy (6%), and the UK (5.7%).In contrast, Russia would be among the three most resilient countries, with its economy shrinking by no more than 3.5%. China would see a 3.1% decline in GDP, while the US would experience a 2.3% drop.The study also indicated that the economies of Australia, Indonesia, and Japan would contract by 3.7-3.8%, making them less vulnerable to trade sanctions compared to India, Brazil, and Canada, which would see GDP declines of 4%, 4.2%, and 5.5%, respectively.Analysts attributed the resilience of the American, Chinese, and Russian economies to their Composite Index of National Capability, which includes significant natural resources, human capital, scientific prowess, and military potential.Stanislav Murashov, Chief Economist at Raiffeisenbank, commented on the findings, saying, ""The winner is the one who, in general terms, geared up for [restrictions] by localizing their production, or someone who will be able, for example, to abandon some imported components, parts, raw materials, equipment. Judging by the study, a possible thesis is confirmed that Europe is more reliant on the global market than China, the US, and Russia.""Despite being subjected to a wide array of international economic sanctions due to the Ukraine conflict, the Russian economy has shown resilience. It initially contracted by 1.2% in 2022 but posted growth of 3.6% last year. Preliminary estimates for the first quarter of 2024 indicate a further GDP increase of 5.4% year-on-year. The International Monetary Fund projects the Russian economy to expand by 3.2% this year, outpacing several major Western economies, including the US (2.7%), UK (0.5%), France (0.7%), and Germany (0.2%).","A study by the Sino-Russian Laboratory for Assessing the Consequences of Intercountry Trade Wars has revealed that the British, German, and French economies would be significantly impacted if their trade ties were cut off.

Wearing a green Batik shirt, Musk was greeted with a garland of flower petals at a community health clinic in Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali, where he launched the Starlink service alongside Indonesian ministers.Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 17,000 islands sprawled across three time zones with a population of more than 270 million, has been trying for years to secure deals with Musk's Tesla on battery investment and for Musk's SpaceX to provide fast internet for the country's remote regions.During the ceremony, Musk took a speed test of the Starlink internet service with several health workers in Indonesia's remote regions, including in Aru, one of Indonesia's unserved and outermost islands in Maluku province.""This can make it really a lifesaver for remote medical clinics, and I think it could be a possibility for education as well,"" Musk told reporters.""If you can access the internet and then you can learn anything and you can also sell your business services worldwide. So, I think it's going to be incredibly beneficial,"" he said.He also signed an agreement on enhancing connectivity in the country's health and education sectors. Details about the agreement between the Indonesian government and Musk's SpaceX, the aerospace company that operates Starlink services, were not provided.Launching the service at a health clinic aligns with Starlink's broader mission of providing affordable access to high-speed internet services, particularly in underserved and remote regions, said coordinating minister of maritime and investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.""Our remote regions need Starlink to expand high-speed internet services, especially to help with problems in the health, education and maritime sectors,"" Pandjaitan, a close ally of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo , told reporters. He held separate talks with Musk on sunday.Communication and informatics minister Budi Arie Setiadi said earlier that local internet providers, which rely on base transceiver stations to transmit signals, are unable to reach outer islands because they have limited coverage. Starlink's satellites, which remain in low orbit, will help them deliver faster internet with nationwide coverage.Health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said of the more than 10,000 clinics across the country, there are still around 2,700 without internet access.""The internet can open up better access to health services as communication between regions is said to be easier, so that reporting from health service facilities can be done in real time or up to date,"" he said.During his first in-person visit to Bali, Musk is also scheduled to participate in the 10th World Water Forum, which seeks to address global water and sanitation challenges.Musk spoke in 2022 at the B-20 business forum ahead of a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies that took place in Bali. He joined the conference by video link weeks after completing his heavily scrutinised takeover of Twitter.Musk's visit comes just weeks after Apple CEO Tim Cook met Widodo on April 17 and said the company would ""look at"" manufacturing in Indonesia. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella visited on April 30 and said the company would invest $1.7 billion over the next four years in new cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Indonesia.Indonesia under Widodo has promoted development of the digital technology and information sectors, aiming to achieve the government's Golden Indonesia 2045 Vision.
