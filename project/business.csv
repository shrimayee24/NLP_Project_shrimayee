The case centres on a profitable agreement between Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another organisation to provide 12 gigawatts of solar power to India's government, sufficient to power numerous homes and commercial establishments.Ramesh criticised SEBI's investigation approach, stating, ""The SEC's actions also cast poor light on the manner in which its Indian counterpart, namely SEBI, has gone about investigating violations of securities and other laws by the Adani Group and its abject failure to hold the Group to account for the source of its investments, shell companies, etc.""The legal documents reveal that whilst presenting the project favourably to Wall Street investors who invested billions over five years, the accused were simultaneously involved in a USD 265 million bribery scheme in India to secure contracts and funding.Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller noted that Adani and associates aimed to ""obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors.""US Attorney Breon Peace said the defendants “orchestrated an elaborate scheme” and sought to ""enrich themselves at the expense of the integrity of our financial markets.”","The Congress reiterated its demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the transactions of the Adani Group.

Delhi high court stays proceedings against PC in Maxis case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-high-court-stays-proceedings-against-pc-in-maxis-case/articleshow/115511418.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday stayed proceedings against former Union minister P Chidambaram 's alleged involvement in the Aircel Maxis money laundering case. The single judge bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri acted on a plea by him challenging the trial court's decision to take cognisance of the chargesheet filed by the ED against him in the case.""In the present case, the petitioner being a public servant and the commission of offence by him while being a public servant not being in dispute, the challenge to the legality of order taking cognisance and continuation of proceedings for want of sanction in light of allegations levelled in prosecution complaint(s), would require further consideration. At this stage, bearing in mind the import of the aforesaid decision, it is deemed apposite to direct that till the next date of hearing, proceedings before the trial court qua the present petitioner shall remain stayed,"" it said. tnnHigh court also issued notice to ED seeking the agency's reply on Chidambaram's petition. The next hearing of the case has been scheduled for Nov 22. Chidambaram filed a petition in HC contesting trial court's decision to acknowledge ED complaint against him and his son, Karti Chidambaram , in the Aircel-Maxis case. Senior advocate N Hariharan, who represented the ex-minister, argued that the cognisance could not be taken without prosecution sanction.Hariharan said that in the absence of sanction, the continuation of proceedings before trial court is illegal. He submitted Supreme Court has reiterated that in the case of a public servant, the obtainment of prior sanction under Section 197(1) CrPC is mandatory and cognisance taken by trial court is thus contrary to the settled legal position.Referring to an SC judgment, he further submitted that the issue of sanction being central to the continuation of the trial can be raised at any stage. Advocate Zoheb Hossain represented ED.The case pertains to alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approvals granted to Aircel-Maxis deal at the time when Chidambaram was Union finance minister.

CBI and ED alleged that Chidambaram, as finance minister, granted approval to the deal benefitting certain people and received kickbacks.The chargesheet named a total of 18 people, including Chidambaram, his son, former finance secretaries Ashok Chawla, former Aircel CEO V Srinivasan, and Maxis owners T Ananda Krishnan and Augustus Ralph Marshall.",The Delhi high court on Wednesday stayed proceedings against former Union minister P Chidambaram's alleged involvement in the Aircel Maxis money laundering case.

After the debacle for Indian pollsters in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year and the recently finished Haryana elections, most TV channels refrained from commissioning exit polls for the Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly elections . That apart, exit polls released Wednesday evening after close of polling in Maharashtra and the second phase in Jharkhand hinted at an advantage for NDA in both states. Counting of votes for both states will take place on Nov 23.The list of polls compiled by TOI from news media and posts on X from their official handles showed that six of the 10 exit polls in Maharashtra gave a clear advantage to the NDA (Mahayuti), one predicted a near-equal show while the remaining three gave the opposition INDIA bloc ( Maha Vikas Aghadi ) the edge.In Jharkhand, three of the seven polls gave a clear edge to opposition NDA in the 81-member House, one indicated a close fight, and two gave INDIA majority. One poll gave neither alliance a majority.Among the polls in Maharashtra that put NDA ahead, the maximum number of seats for the combine in the 288-member assembly varied by around 40 seats - from 157 as predicted by P-Marq to 195 by Peoples Pulse. 'Poll Diary', that predicted a maximum of 186 seats for NDA, kept the range at 122-86 - a margin of 64 seats. The same pollster predicted 69-121 seats for INDIA bloc, again a margin of 53 seats.Polls that gave an edge to NDA suggest most seats will be divided between the two alliances, with other parties reduced to single-digit tallies.Polls that predicted either an equal battle or gave the advantage to INDIA gave a higher number of seats to other parties. Dainik Bhaskar, Electoral Edge and SAS predicted an advantage to INDIA, with Electoral Edge giving the fewest seats to NDA, at 118.In Jharkhand too, most exit polls predict an advantage for NDA. Three of the seven polls have given a clear edge to the saffron combine while Times Now- JVC indicates NDA might have an advantage but the INDIA alliance is very close to the majority mark of 41 seats.Dainik Bhaskar has not given clear majority to either alliance, indicating a neck-and-neck contest.

Lawrence's brother Anmol applies for asylum in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawrences-brother-anmol-applies-for-asylum-in-us/articleshow/115506325.cms,"NEW DELHI: Anmol Bishnoi, the younger brother of notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, is learnt to have applied for asylum in the US through his counsel. Bishnoi, detained last week, has been lodged at the Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa, sources said.Known as 'Squirrel Cage Jail', the prison was referenced in an old radio programme called 'Gang Busters'. The prison facility's website had Anmol's details and mentioned his name as Anmol Bishnoi. It said he was being investigated by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which deals with cross-border crime and undocumented immigration.While Anmol's arrest in the US seems triggered by information shared by the Indian govt about his illegal entry into the country, sources, however, suggested that he may have deliberately surrendered to US authorities as a tactical move to seek asylum. This development came after Mumbai police initiated extradition proceedings against him.Sources said before his detention, Anmol Bishnoi had applied for asylum through the US Citizenship and Immigration Services , a division of Department of Homeland Security. Now that he has initiated asylum proceedings through legal channels, it's unlikely that he will be extradited to India or any other country.The US legal system's tendency to grant bail in such cases, coupled with the precedent set by gangster Goldy Brar's release, raises the possibility that Anmol might evade extradition to India. Brar, too, has applied for asylum, sources said.Also, there is a possibility that Canada police may try to get access to him in connection with some gang-related cases being investigated by RCMP.FBI is learnt to be in the process of verifying Anmol's identity, possibly through a voice sample or a DNA match, sources said. The US agency officials, who had earlier this month confirmed his presence in America, are in touch with Indian agencies for subsequent processes, including his deportation.Anmol, who has a red notice issued against him by Interpol, is an accused in several high-profile cases, including the recent murder of former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique and the firing incident outside Bollywood actor Salman Khan's residence in Mumbai.Anmol has also been accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Sidhu Moosewala who was killed on May 29, 2022.",Anmol Bishnoi is learnt to have applied for asylum in the US through his counsel.

India slips on climate list but still a high performer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-slips-on-climate-list-but-still-a-high-performer/articleshow/115506323.cms,"BAKU: India slipped from 7th rank a year ago to 10th in the latest Climate Change Performance Index , but the country along with the UK (6th) are the only G20 nations on the high-performers list, showed an annual report released on the sidelines of CO on Wednesday.Despite the drop, India remains on the list of top 10 high-performing countries for the sixth year in a row. India, which ranked 31st in 2014, entered the top 10 in 2019.Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK take the lead as fourth, fifth and sixth rankers with the top three ranks remaining vacant like the previous years in the absence of a perfect score to any country.The world's biggest emitter China ranks 55th and the second biggest, US, remains at 57th position - they are among very low performers, according to the 20th edition of CCPI, released jointly by Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute, and CAN International.The four last-placed countries in the CCPI are Iran, Saudi Arabia, last year UN climate talks host UAE and Russia — ranked 67, 66, 65 and 64, respectively. “All four are among the largest oil and gas producers worldwide. The share of renewables in their energy mix is lower than 3%. These countries show no sign of departing from fossil fuels as a business model,” the report, which assessed the progress made by the largest emitters globally, said.Noting that the renewables are in the fast lane, especially in the electricity sector, lead author of CCPI, Jan Burck from the Germanwatch said, “Nevertheless, there is still massive resistance from the fossil fuel lobby. Countries should not fall deeper into the fossil trap.""The CCPI uses a standardized framework to compare the climate performance of 63 countries and the EU, which together account for over 90% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The climate mitigation performance of countries is assessed in four categories: GHG emission, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy.India gets a high ranking in the GHG emission and energy use categories, medium in climate policy, and low in renewable energy. “While India is the world’s most populous country, it has relatively low per capita emissions and low energy use,” said the report.The report underlined that though India has seen considerable progress in renewable energy policy, particularly in large-scale solar power projects and the launch of the Rooftop Solar Scheme, in the past year, the country remains heavily reliant on coal, with the experts noting that its phase-out is progressing too slowly. India is among the 10 countries with the largest developed coal reserves, and is currently planning to even increase its production.The report shows that 14 G20 countries including the US, China, Canada (62nd), Australia (52nd), South Korea (63rd), Argentine (59th) and Janan (58th) get an overall low or very low ranking.“The G20 is particularly responsible for drastically cutting emissions, as its members account for more than 75% of the world’s GHG emissions. Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea are still the G20’s worst-performing countries and receive an overall very low (ranks),” said the report.","India slipped from 7th rank a year ago to 10th in the latest Climate Change Performance Index.

NEW DELHI: The BJP is all set to retain power in Maharashtra with its Mahayuti allies - Shiv Sena and NCP- and could be in for a very close contest in Jharkhand, according to exit poll predictions for the two states. The poll of polls projects clear lead for the Mahayuti with 155 seats while the opposition's Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance could get 122 seats in the 288-member state assembly. The others may get 11 seats. However, in Jharkhand, the contest is likely to be close. According to the poll of polls prediction for the state, the BJP-led NDA will win 40 seats which is just one short to hit the majority in the 81-member assembly while chief minister Hemant Soren-led INDIA bloc could bag 37 seats.In Maharashtra, three pollsters - Peoples Pulse, Matrize and Chankya Strategies have predicted clear majority for the Mahayuti while the rest three - P-Marq, Dainik Bhaskar and Poll Diary have predicted Mahayuti ahead of the MVA, but short of majority.The Matrize exit poll predicted 150-170 seats for the BJP and allies in Maharashtra with a 48 per cent vote share, it gave the Congress and other allies only 110-130 seats with a vote share of 42 per cent. The poll gave others 8 to 10 seats, with a vote share of 10 per cent.People's Pulse gave NDA's Mahayuti a whopping 175-195 seats while giving only 85-112 seats to MVA and 7-12 to others in Maharashtra. P-MARQ has predicted a total of 137-157 seats for the Mahayuti and 126-146 seats for INDIA Bloc's MVA. Exit polls by Poll Diary predicted the NDA to win in 122-186 seats and the MVA 69-121 while forecasting 12-29 seats for others in Maharashtra. Chanakya Strategies, another pollster, has predicted 152-160 seats for Mahayuti and 130-138 seats for MVA while giving 6-8 seats for others in Maharashtra.In the 2019 assembly elections, the BJP had emerged as the single largest party with 105 seats and its ally the Shiv Sena had won 56. However, the two allies could not agree on the chief minister's post following which Uddhav Thackeray parted ways with the BJP. He went on to form the MVA government with the help of Congress and the NCP which had won 44 and 54 seats respectively. In 2022, the BJP extracted its revenge after Eknath Shinde split the Shiv Sena to ensure the fall of the MVA government. Shinde was made the chief minister by the BJP. A year later, Ajit Pawar rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and split the NCP to complete the Mahayuti.In Jharkhand, the BJP is projected ahead of the JMM-led INDIA bloc by several pollsters while one has predicted a clean sweep for chief minister Hemant Soren. The poll of exit polls for Jharkhand predicts 40 seats for the BJP-led NDA and 38 for the JMM-led INDIA bloc in the state.The Matrize Exit poll has predicted 42-47 seats for NDA and 25-30 seats for the INDIA bloc while giving 0-4 seats to others. People's Pulse has projected 44-53 seats for NDA and 25-37 seats for INDIA Bloc. It has given 5-9 seats to others. Chanakya Strategies exit poll says BJP-led NDA is likely to win 45-50 seats in the state while JMM-led alliance could win 35-38 seats. It said others could get 3-5 seats. Times Now-JVC has predicted 40-44 seats for BJP-led NDA and 30-40 seats for INDIA bloc.However, Axis My India has predicted a clean sweep for the JMM-led alliance in Jharkhand and projected that the INDIA bloc will win 53 seats. The pollster has given NDA 25 seats and Jharkhand Loktantrik Krantikari Morcha (JKLM) two seats. According to the projections, JLKM could end up damaging the prospects of NDA in the state by walking away with a large chunk of Mahto votes.The only polling agency forecasting a hung house in Jharkhand is Dainik Bhaskar. It shows people’s mandate vertically divided with both alliances settling between 36-40 seats, moderately shorter than the halfway mark of 41.In the 2019 assembly elections, the JMM had emerged as the single largest party in Jharkhand with 30 seats, while the BJP could manage only 25. JMM formed a government in alliance with the Congress which had won 16 seats and the RJD which had one seat.It will be interesting to see how the exit polls fare when the votes are counted on November 23. With two big back to back exit poll failures this year, all political parties, and, even the pollsters, would wait for the final results with bated breath.","The BJP is all set to retain power in Maharashtra with its Mahayuti allies - Shiv Sena and NCP- and could be in for a very close contest in Jharkhand.

Pollution making North India weather more smog-prone: US study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pollution-making-north-india-weather-more-smog-prone-us-study/articleshow/115503097.cms,"Seasonal weather conditions like calm winds and low temperatures are known to aggravate air pollution over north India at this time of year. But research suggests that increasing pollution has amplified some of these meteorological factors over the past few decades - which, in turn, may intensify smog further.This pollution-weather loop is likely contributing to the current extreme haze in Delhi and other parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain, say experts. A study published last year showed that soot, black carbon and other kinds of aerosol pollution is magnifying the 'temperature inversion' effect often seen in winter, in which warm air traps colder air on the surface below, preventing pollution from dissipating. That's because these aerosols have a warming effect on the lower troposphere - the lowest part of the atmosphere - while cooling the air on the surface below.Aerosol pollution raises the stability of the lower troposphere and aggravates the temperature inversion that is happening naturally, said Ritesh Gautam, a senior researcher at Environmental Defence Fund in the US, who led the study along with NASA researchers. ""This amplification effect seems to be strengthening decade on decade,"" Gautam said. The study found a nine-fold increase since 1980 in the number of days when visibility is less than 500 metres during Nov. There was a five-old increase in such days in Dec-Jan, including in Delhi.Researchers looked at data over four decades to understand the interaction of pollution and atmosphere over the Indo-Gangetic plain. They found aerosol pollution in Nov increased by around 90% between 2002 and 2019, likely due to the rise of crop burning. Exceptionally high aerosol pollution rose in Dec-Jan, too, by around 40%.Those two decades saw a correspondingly large warming of the lower troposphere. The stability in this layer also showed an increase, with the height of the planetary boundary layer dropping since 1980. This layer acts like a dome confining the pollution to the ground, so any increase in its stability or decrease in its height would prolong or intensify smoggy conditions on the ground.""The stability does not allow air to move out,"" said S N Tripathi, a senior scientist at IIT Kanpur. Another factor is increased relative humidity, perhaps due to increased irrigation. More moisture in the air means more droplets of fog or smog can form. The study found a 20% rise in surface humidity since 1980.All these factors are coming together to create a ""multiple whammy"" for Delhi and other parts of north India, said Gautam. ""You can't control the weather, but you can control the amount of pollution that is combining with the weather to produce this severe smog,"" he said.The physics of this feedback cycle between pollution and atmospheric stability is known, but Gautam's study provides evidence of its effect over time, said Tripathi, who was not involved in that study. The long-term rise in lower tropospheric stability and relative humidity is also due to climate variability, said Chandra Venkatraman, an aerosol specialist at IIT Bombay. How much this meteorological change contributes to extreme smog is unclear.Emissions remain the main driver of pollution, she noted. ""Unabated emissions and increased secondary aerosol production under high stability and relative humidity conditions is leading to the extreme PM2.5 conditions over north India and Pakistan,"" she said. Transboundary pollution may also be playing a role in Delhi's current crisis, said Tripathi, adding that there seems to be a large pollution spike over Lahore.","Aerosol pollution is magnifying the 'temperature inversion' effect often seen in winter. Warm air traps colder air on the surface below, preventing pollution from dissipating. Researchers looked at data over four decades to understand the interaction of pollution and atmosphere.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115503185,imgsize-485686,width-400,resizemode-4/115503185.jpg"
Biren Singh's vow to crack down on 'militants' fails to stem stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biren-singhs-vow-to-crack-down-on-militants-fails-to-stem-stir/articleshow/115506086.cms,"(With inputs from HC Vanlalruata in Aizawl)

A pause in Meitei protests Wednesday after the BJP-led govt's assurance of ""a comprehensive crackdown"" on Kuki militant groups in Manipur's hill districts within a week proved short-lived as multiple organisations in Imphal valley declared their agitation would continue until they saw results on the ground.The uproar came amid an indefinite curfew in Imphal East, Imphal West and Kakching and the administration's decision to extend the mobile internet blackout across seven districts for three more days. Curfew had been eased for five hours from 5am. In the evening, the state govt announced that schools in all valley districts would be shut till Nov 23.Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI) had announced suspension of its indefinite sit-in at Ima Market in the heart of Imphal for a week by citing N Biren Singh govt's assurances on its demands, but was apparently forced to back-track by Meitei protest groups unwilling to take the administration's word for it.This came a day after COCOMI rejected an eight-point NDA resolution adopted by 27 MLAs Monday night to go all out against the Kuki militants suspected of killing six Meitei inmates - three women and as many children - of a shelter for the displaced in Jiribam. The organisation gave the state govt 24 hours to announce operations against all Kuki militant outfits bound by the tripartite Suspension of Operations agreement, holding them accountable for over 18 months of ethnic bloodletting.""We will observe how the (revised) resolution passed by the legislators is implemented. Further action will be decided after that,"" COCOMI coordinator Somorendro Thokchom told the media.While security forces go after Kuki militants in the hill districts, NIA would probe the abduction and killing of six shelter inmates, COCOMI was assured.But protesters, including Meira Paibis (women activists) from Keisampat Thiyam Leikai, promptly resumed the sit-in against what they termed an ""inadequate response"" from the state govt to repeated attacks by militants.At Kongba in Imphal East, a demonstration by 12 Clubs Wangkhei Road demanded action against the state's 10 Kuki MLAs, seven of them of BJP, for allegedly supporting militant activity. Similar protests were organised at Ayangpalli Road and Wangkhei Puja Lampak, with participants calling for action against all Kuki-Zo and Hmar militants.","Meitei groups in Manipur valley declare their agitation will continue until they see results on the ground.

""Amicable relations"" between India and China, the two most populated nations in the world and major engines of global growth, would have ""positive implications"" for global peace and prosperity as well as help stabilise the world economy, he said.The meeting comes after Indian and Chinese troops disengaged at the remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last month and then resumed ""coordinated"" patrolling in the two areas.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had also held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of G20 summit in Brazil two days ago, where the next steps towards normalising the overall bilateral relations, like resumption of direct flights and the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra as well as data sharing on trans-border rivers, were discussed.The Depsang-Demchok disengagement, of course, is only the first step towards restoring normalcy along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. India wants it to be followed by de-escalation and then de-induction of troops ranged against each other.Sources told TOI that latest surveillance and intelligence inputs show China continues to deploy around 22 to 23 combined arms brigades (CABs) in forward locations and training areas along the western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) sectors of the LAC. Each CAB has around 4,500-5,000 soldiers with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery, and surface-to-air missile systems, among other weapon systems.Moreover, People's Liberation Army (PLA) also continues with its ""heightened activity"" across Yangtse, Asaphila, Longju, and Fish Tail-1 & 2 areas in Arunachal Pradesh, sources said. At the bilateral, Singh reiterated India's consistent stand throughout the stand-off - which erupted after PLA made multiple intrusions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020 - that border issues cannot be separated from the overall bilateral relations.Singh also called for reflecting on the lessons learnt from the ""unfortunate border clashes"" at Galwan Valley in June 2020, taking measures to prevent recurrence of such events, and safeguarding peace and tranquillity along the border. Singh emphasised he looked forward to greater trust and confidence-building between the two sides through de-escalation. With the Depsang-Demchok disengagement, there is no longer any eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which will prevent any sudden inadvertent vertical escalation on the ground. But there is still a long way to go before the forward deployed rival troops go back to their peacetime locations.","Rajnath Singh tells his Chinese counterpart Admiral Dong Jun that it is now crucial to move forward from the recent troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh to de-escalation.

They offer a peek into voter sentiment and have often shaped media narratives and public expectations. However, the credibility of these polls has come under scrutiny due to their inconsistent track record.Historically, exit polls enjoyed a certain degree of trust, especially after notable successes like the 1998 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. However, their credibility took a hit with significant misses in subsequent elections. The 2004 LS elections, where exit polls predicted a BJP victory only for the Congress-led coalition to win, marked a turning point. This trend of inaccuracy continued, with varying degrees of misprediction in state elections as well.In Maharashtra, assembly elections have always been a battleground for major political forces, leading to numerous exit polls being commissioned. Yet, the results over the years have often diverged from what was predicted, leading to scepticism.The 2019 assembly elections in Maharashtra, for instance, saw mixed results for exit polls, with some agencies closely predicting the outcome and others missing the mark significantly. The 2024 LS polls further highlighted this issue, where BJP-led alliance ended up with fewer seats than expected while exit polls suggested a landslide.Jharkhand's political scenario, characterised by its regional parties and coalition politics, has been a challenging field for exit polls. State's elections have often seen predictions fail to capture the intricate local dynamics or the influence of tribal politics.","The trend of forecasting poll results has witnessed a significant shift, as evident in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.

GANDHINAGAR: The Centre will strive to ensure that all undertrials who have served one-third of the maximum sentence for the offence they are charged with receive justice before Constitution Day is celebrated, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday. The adoption of the Constitution is commemorated on November 26.Shah said, ""We have put in place 60 provisions for the court, the prosecution and police to complete their work within a time limit.

He added that law enforcement agencies will have to stay a step ahead of criminals in these five areas.“These five areas will be a challenge not just for India but for the whole world,” Shah told about 250 delegates at the conference, organised by Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D).He said AIPSC should work towards analysing data to bring about changes in the system to reduce crime, its investigation and speedy justice. “AIPSC needs to use AI to make data result-oriented and more effective,” Shah said.Commenting on three new criminal laws that were passed earlier this year, Shah said the home ministry made extensive preparations before implementing the three new laws. “Following their implementation, justice will be delivered to people from SC level within three years from the date of registration of a first information report (FIR),” Shah added.He said 70,000 police stations were connected to CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems), 22,000 courts through e-courts, data of 2 crore prisoners is stored in e-prisons system and that of over 1.5 crore prosecution in e-prosecution system, more than 23 lakh forensic data in e-forensic, among other things.","The adoption of the Constitution is commemorated on November 26.

The first thing I did was to call the commissioner of Pune and tell him that some fake videos were running, and I wanted to complain to cybercrime,” Sule stated.“I immediately complained to cybercrime that all these voice notes and messages were lies and fake, so I sent a notice to cybercrime,” she added.When asked about her brother Ajit Pawar’s comments regarding the audio clip, she responded, ""He is Ajit Pawar, he can say anything. 'Ram Krishna Hari.'""In addition to the cybercrime complaint, Sule filed a criminal defamation notice against BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi. “I am ready to come out and answer Sudhanshu Trivedi anytime in whichever city he wants, on whichever channel he wants, at whatever time he wants, wherever he calls me, I will come and I will answer him,” she said.Sule further stated, “Familiar tactics of spreading false information to manipulate the righteous voters are being resorted to, a night before the polling day. We have filed a criminal complaint to the Hon’ble ECI & the Cyber crime department against the fake allegations made of bitcoin misappropriation.”The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday searched the Raipur premises of Gaurav Mehta, an employee of audit firm Sarathi Associates, in connection with an alleged bitcoin scam. The raids aim to trace financial irregularities tied to cryptocurrency transactions linked to the ongoing Maharashtra assembly elections, officials said.Ravindranath Patil alleged the involvement of Amitabh Gupta and Bhagyashri Nautake and said, ""My company called me as a cryptocurrency expert to investigate a case in 2018. I was arrested in that case in 2022 under allegations of fraud. I spent 14 months in jail after a trial. During that time, I was wondering what had happened, what the case was, and why I was trapped. There were other colleagues also with me. We were working on finding out the truth. A witness against us, Gaurav Mehta, who is an employee of an audit firm named Sarathi Associates.""A day before yesterday, he called me multiple times for 4-5 hours, but I did not respond... Finally, when I responded, he told me that in 2018, when Amit Bharadwaj was arrested, he had a cryptocurrency hardware wallet... That wallet was replaced by the then commissioner Amitabh Gupta and another wallet was kept. We were arrested but the real perpetrators were Amitabh Gupta and his team. He (Gaurav Mehta) took the names of two IPS officers, Amitabh Gupta and Bhagyashri Nautake. He took two people's name one is Supriya Sule and Nana Patole. He then told me that in this assembly elections bitcoins are being used,"" Patil alleged further.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered an FIR into a bitcoin-based ponzi scam against Amit Bhardwaj, Ajay Bhardwaj and others.The accused persons allegedly collected 80,000 bitcoins and diverted the funds worth Rs 6,606 crore through nine overseas firms to purchase properties abroad. The agency has also summoned Gaurav Mehta to join the investigation, the CBI sources told news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Patole denying any involvement in the alleged case said, ""The IPS officer brought by BJP, Ravindra Patil is not even an IPS officer. BJP has become a party of lies. On the eve of elections, they are doing all this. My voice is not there in the audio. I am a farming man, I don't even understand Bitcoin. We have given a legal notice and filed an FIR. We will also file a defamation case against them. Be it Sudhanshu Trivedi or Ravindra Patil. Everything will be clear soon. BJP is only lying. We will fight them legally...I have nothing to do with this. We will file defamation...Our government is going to be formed in Maharashtra, we will conduct a proper inquiry in this.""Nationalist Congress Party (NCP-SCP) chief Sharad Pawar defended Supriya Sule and said, ""The person who made the allegations was in jail for several months, and taking that person along and making false allegations—only BJP can do this.""BJP MP and national spokesperson Sambit Patra, in a press conference, criticised Supriya Sule’s denial of the allegations, pointing to her brother Ajit Pawar’s acknowledgment of her voice in the recordings. ""Today Supriya Sule is saying that this is AI generated, this is not my voice, whereas her own brother is saying that this is her voice,"" Patra remarked.Patra elaborated on the allegations, claiming, ""There are four such audios of Supriya Sule... you can also see Nana Patole giving instructions to Amitabh Gupta, the commissioner. In the chat that has taken place in the Signal app, apart from Supriya Sule and Nana Patole, there are some other big players. If there is any biggest player in this game of loot and corruption in this country, then it is Sonia ji and Rahul ji,"" he stated, urging Rahul Gandhi to clarify whether he directed Patole. Patra added that the alleged transaction involving Rs 235 crore from Dubai warrants an investigation into its authenticity.","NCP(SP) leader Supriya Sule and Congress leader Nana Patole are accused of misappropriating bitcoins from a 2018 cryptocurrency fraud case to finance the state elections.

Both India and Australia Batters Have Struggled in the Last Few Series

India Need to Take a Big Call on the Pace Bowling Department for Perth Test

Former Australian opener David Warner has publicly endorsed Nathan McSweeney as a potential standout performer in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy . The prestigious Test series between Australia and India is scheduled to commence on Friday in Perth.McSweeney, the 25-year-old captain of the South Australian cricket team, is poised to make his Test debut for Australia. He has been chosen to open the batting alongside the experienced Usman Khawaja in the first Test.The opening batsman position became available due to Steve Smith 's decision to return to his preferred batting position at number four. McSweeney's recent experience as an opener is limited, stemming from a solitary match against India A in Melbourne. In that game, he registered scores of 14 and 25.Despite the limited exposure, Warner expressed unwavering confidence in McSweeney's ability to acclimatize to the demands of opening the batting at the highest level.""I think he's got the technique, he's got the patience to partner up with Uzzy (Khawaja) to allow himself to score big,"" Warner said during a media interaction in Melbourne.""I’ve pencilled him in to be the highest run-scorer this year, so I'm looking forward to that.""Warner highlighted the complementary batting styles of McSweeney and Khawaja, emphasizing their shared attribute of patience at the crease. He believes their approach could provide a solid foundation for the Australian batting lineup.""I think they've both got the same sort of patience, which is going to be good for them and hold the middle order in good stead,"" Warner added.McSweeney's inclusion in the Australian Test squad signifies a generational transition within a predominantly experienced lineup. The majority of the players in the current squad are in their thirties, prompting discussions about succession planning.Warner acknowledged the need for Australia to address the inevitable retirements of senior players in the near future. He specifically mentioned Usman Khawaja, who is 37 years old, as an example.""Australia needs to think about succession planning, especially with players like Uzzy, who’s 37, nearing the end of their careers,"" Warner said.However, Warner cautioned against rushing the development of young players like McSweeney. He urged the national selectors to exercise patience and allow McSweeney adequate time to establish himself in the challenging environment of Test cricket.""It's not just these five Test matches; it's the signs that you see (McSweeney) as a talented batsman for the future,"" he explained.""You've got to give guys a crack. I know there are other guys that have been there—Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft—but it'd be exciting just to see him score some runs first to establish himself.""Warner further emphasized the need for a long-term perspective on McSweeney's development, even if he encounters initial setbacks.""But if he doesn't [score runs immediately], just give him some time, give him maybe two summers.""","Nathan McSweeney, 25, is poised to make his Test debut for Australia.

With bypolls concluded and the election campaign in Maharashtra's wrapping up on Monday, officials expect the project to gain momentum.Infrastructure department (ID) officials say site selection is now in the final phase and a proposal will be sent to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) later this week after ID minister MB Patil returns from poll duty in Maharashtra.""Preliminary preparations are on track. The shortlist is now down to three. The govt has asked for a detailed analysis of pros and cons of these three sites. One or two will be finalised and a proposal sent to AAI thereafter,"" an official said.The urgency stems from Tamil Nadu's plans to develop a greenfield international airport in Hosur, which could diminish Bengaluru's strategic advantage if Karnataka delays its proposal.""Our govt is mindful of the fierce competition from Tamil Nadu,"" said Priyank Kharge, IT-BT minister and govt spokesperson. ""The process to finalise a location is being expedited. There will be no delay.""In Aug, the govt shortlisted seven potential locations and intended to seek AAI's input on technical feasibility. But internal disagreements on the location delayed progress, forcing chief minister Siddaramaiah to temporarily put the project on hold.Home minister G Parameshwara, representing Koratagere, wanted the airport near Tumakuru, while deputy CM DK Shivakumar preferred locations in his home district of Ramanagara, with Bidadi and Harohalli emerging as strong contenders.But stakeholders and domain experts favour a site in southern Bengaluru to alleviate traffic congestion at the city's existing airport in the north. Adding complexity, Shivakumar is also proposing a skydeck in Hemmigepura, which will fall within the air traffic zone of the potential Bidadi or Harohalli airport sites.To address concerns on the skydeck, the govt sought public feedback. BBMP chief engineer for projects, M Lokesh, said: ""We are open to looking for an alternative site for the skydeck. More than 300 suggestions have come from the public. We will soon finalise the location keeping all factors in mind,"" Lokesh said.","The state govt is expediting plans for Bengaluru's second international airport.

Seems like Narayan Murthy has found his perfect disciple, finally! The Infosys founder recently sparked a debate when he expressed disappointment with India’s transition from a ‘six-day to a five-day workweek in 1986’. Murthy remarked, “We need to work hard in this country. There is no replacement for hard work. Even if you are the most intelligent guy, you have to work hard. So I’m not going back on my views. I’ll take it to my grave,”Now, after Murthy’s remarks sparked an outrage amidst millennial and gen-Z workers, it seems like the internet has found a near-perfect disciple who Murthy would be proud of! San Francisco-based Greptile , an artificial intelligence start-up led by Indian-origin CEO and co-founder Daksh Gupta , has ignited a social media storm after Gupta defended his company’s controversial work culture.In a recent tweet, Gupta detailed Greptile's demanding work schedule, admitting that employees face long hours, high stress, and little work-life balance . His openness, though intended to be transparent, quickly drew a barrage of criticism online. In his original post, Gupta explained his approach, stating, “Recently, I started telling candidates right in the first interview that Greptile offers no work-life balance. Typical workdays start at 9 a.m. and end at 11 p.m., often later, and we work Saturdays, sometimes also Sundays.” This would make an employee work for 84 hours or more for six days of work.He added that his aim was to provide clarity for potential hires, so they “know this from the get-go rather than find out on their first day.” The disclosure quickly went viral, garnering over 1.6 million views and sparking a wave of heated responses.However, Gupta made it a point to assure that Greptile’s model, while intense, is voluntary for those who want this style of startup culture. He added, “The people that work here had six-figure, 20-hour/week jobs before this, and can go back to them any time.”Netizen didn’t take much time to criticise Gupta’s approach towards work at Greptile without caring a bit about the work-life balance. One user questioned, “Transparency is great, but what makes you think this will make your company successful instead of giving weekends off to increase productivity?” Another accused him of exploiting workers for personal gain, saying, “It’s great to see that you’re already exploiting workers straight out of college.”Following the backlash, Gupta mentioned that his inbox has been a mix of ‘20 per cent death threats and 80 per cent job applications’. However, the Greptile CEO empathised with everyone who is overworked and underpaid, and noted, “i feel for you, and i’m sorry this struck a nerve. it might be hard to believe but there exist people that want this, while a minority.”Gupta, who graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology (also known as Georgia Tech) last year, is based in the US, recalls how a billionaire's generosity in writing a cheque of $1,00,000 two years ago facilitated him to pursue the journey of entrepreneurship.Gupta clarified the intense work culture was not meant to be permanent, adding it was part of the early growth phase of a start-up. He mentioned, “This way of working isn't supposed to be forever because it isn't sustainable. It's the first year or two of a startup which is like reaching escape velocity. Like people said in the comments, as we mature we'll hire older, more experienced people who have families and can't work 100 hours a week, and naturally we would adapt like any good organisation.”A few days ago, Infosys founder Narayan Murthy mentioned while delivering a speech at a Global Leadership Summit that he didn’t believe in work-life balance. He sought out an example of PM Modi and added, “Prime Minister Modi probably works 100 hours a week. When his Cabinet Ministers are working very hard, when his bureaucrats are all working very hard, the only way we can show our appreciation for all these wonderful things that are happening is by our work.”What are your views on this?

Nvidia’s market value as of Wednesday’s close, reclaiming the top spot in the S&P 500 from Apple ($3.461 trillion). Microsoft ($3.089 trillion) is the only other company with a market value above $3 trillion. 195 per cent stock gain: Nvidia’s stock price has surged nearly 200 per cent this year. A $100,000 investment two years ago would now be worth over $950,000.

Nvidia’s stock price has surged nearly 200 per cent this year. A $100,000 investment two years ago would now be worth over $950,000. 25 per cent contribution: Nvidia accounted for a quarter of the S&P 500's gains this year (as of October 31). The company recently replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Nvidia continues to dominate the tech world, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations once again with its latest quarterly earnings. The company reported record revenue, driven by skyrocketing demand for its semiconductors, which are essential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.In the quarter ending October 31, Nvidia's revenue nearly doubled, reaching $35.1 billion—an increase of 94 per cent from the same period last year. The company’s data centre business, a key driver of its success, reported $30.8 billion in revenue, a 112 per cent jump year-on-year. Nvidia projects its revenue for the current quarter (ending January) to hit $37.5 billion, give or take 2 per cent.Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, is expected to fuel further growth as demand for AI technology surges globally. The company’s leadership in the AI space has attracted significant investment and driven its market value to new heights.Analysts estimate Nvidia’s revenue for the fiscal year ending January 2025 will reach $126.5 billion—more than four times its earnings from two years ago.Nvidia’s market value of $3.579 trillion is staggering. To put it simply, that’s enough to buy 54.6 billion Thanksgiving meals, each costing $65.51, according to retail intelligence firm Datasembly.While Nvidia’s growth shows no signs of slowing, investors are closely watching how its Blackwell AI chip and other innovations will sustain this extraordinary pace in the future.","N Nvidia’s market value of $3.579 trillion is enough to buy 54.6 billion Thanksgiving meals, each costing $65.51.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
