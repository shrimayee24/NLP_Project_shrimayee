PM Modi Flags Off India’s First Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Between Howrah-Guwahati In Bengal

NEW DELHI: Indian Railways ’ first Vande Bharat sleeper train attracted widespread attention for its modern features and promise of faster overnight travel. However, Indian tourists were quick to prove a lack of civic sense, as a video showing litter on the newly inaugurated train emerged.The high-tech Vande Bharat Sleeper, connecting Howrah and Guwahati, was flagged off on Saturday. A passenger-recorded video from Malda shows plastic packets and spoons scattered across one of the coaches.Sharing the video, X handle @Indianinfoguide wrote, “People litter on vande bharat Sleeper train within hours of its inaugural run. Just see the civic sense.”Several social media users criticised the commuters for their behaviour. One commented, “honestly, this was an expected behaviour from the citizens of India.”Another added, “India doesn’t need enemies. We sabotage ourselves just fine. From breaking rules to trashing infrastructure, from apathy to entitlement, we do more damage internally than any external force could. The real national security threat isn’t always at the border. It’s our collective indifference to the country we live in.”Some users were more casual, with one writing, “Expected !! What’s new here…Wait for orange gutka stamps.”According to the Ministry of Railways, the first commercial run of the Vande Bharat Sleeper between Kamakhya and Howrah saw all tickets sell out within hours of bookings opening.The train’s launch followed the flagging off of India’s first Vande Bharat Sleeper by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Malda town in West Bengal on January 17. The service aims to make long-distance overnight travel faster and more comfortable while improving connectivity between eastern India and the Northeast.The semi-high-speed, fully air-conditioned train will operate six days a week, except Wednesdays from Kamakhya and Thursdays from Howrah. It will complete the Howrah–Kamakhya journey in about 14 hours, making it the fastest train on the route. Key stops include Malda Town, New Jalpaiguri, New Cooch Behar, and New Alipurduar.The service is expected to significantly benefit passengers travelling between West Bengal and Assam, particularly those undertaking overnight journeys.","The high-tech Vande Bharat Sleeper, connecting Howrah and Guwahati, was flagged off on Saturday.

From party worker to its president: Nitin Nabin becomes BJP's youngest chief — 10 things to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-party-worker-to-president-nitin-nabin-takes-charge-as-youngest-bjp-chief-10-things-to-know/articleshow/126757934.cms,"Nitin Nabin takes charge as BJP chief

Who is Nitin Nabin?

Nitin Nabin is a Bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the BJP’s national president post.

He is 45 years old and is the youngest national president of the BJP, surpassing Nitin Gadkari’s record.

Nabin is a five-term MLA from Bankipur in Patna, one of the BJP’s strongest urban constituencies in Bihar.

The new BJP chief currently serves as Public Works Department (PWD) minister in the Bihar government.

His rise in the BJP is closely associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership style and organisational inputs from Amit Shah.

He comes from a strong political lineage and is the son of veteran BJP leader Nabin Kishore Sinha , who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics.

, who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics. Nabin began his political journey through the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and later rose through the BJP’s youth wing.

He has held key organisational roles, including national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and BJYM Bihar president (2016–19).

Nabin played a crucial organisational role in BJP’s Chhattisgarh turnaround, accurately predicting the party’s 2023 assembly victory and later overseeing its strong 2024 Lok Sabha performance.

Belonging to the Kayastha community, a numerically small group in Bihar, his elevation underlines the BJP leadership’s preference for organisational ability over caste arithmetic.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Nitin Nabin on Tuesday assumed charge as the party's new national president, marking a key transition in the ruling party's organisational leadership.The swearing-in ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with several senior party leaders. BJP chief ministers, national office-bearers, state unit presidents and members of the party’s national executive were also present at the event held in the national capital.The ruling party on Monday declared Nabin as its sole candidate for the post after the nomination and scrutiny process concluded without any rival contenders. This cleared the path for his unopposed election as the party’s 12th national president.In a late-night statement, BJP National Returning Officer K. Laxman said that only Nabin’s name remained after the completion of nominations and the withdrawal window, confirming his election by consensus.After assuming the position, Nitin Nabin said the moment is ""a moment of resolve"" for him and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Prime Minister.""Today, I am not just assuming a position. I am accepting the ideology, traditions, and the responsibility of a nationalist movement of this party, and on this occasion, I also pay my respects to all my senior colleagues...Today, 140 crore Indians are connecting themselves with the dream of a developed India and are working to take the country forward,"" Nitin Nabin said in his first address after taking charge as the BJP chief.“When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, calling himself a “party worker” of the BJP.Addressing the gathering after the inauguration of Nitin Nabin as the BJP's youngest-ever national president, PM Modi said: “When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss.”The Prime Minister also highlighted new party chief's age, saying, “…Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP. To put it in the language of today’s youth, Nitin ji himself is, in a way, a millennial.”Elaborating further, PM Modi said, “The next 25 years are very important. This is the period when a developed India is to be built, and it is destined to happen. At the beginning of this crucial period, our Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP.Ahead of the formal assumption of office, the BJP headquarters in New Delhi wore a festive look on Tuesday morning. Nabin began the day by offering prayers at the Jhandewalan Temple and later visited the Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place.Reacting to his elevation, BJP MP Manan Kumar Mishra said the party’s decision reflected its intent to promote younger leadership while relying on experience.“The party has taken a resolve to give space to young leadership. He is young and also quite social. He has a lot of experience. Our party is the largest party in the world. Under his leadership, even better work will be done,” Mishra told reporters.Nabin has been serving as the party’s working national president prior to this elevation.","Nitin Nabin is a Bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the BJP’s national president post.

Nabin’s rise in BJP

NEW DELHI: Nitin Nabin , who formally took charge as the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party today, has his task cut out for him. His immediate challenge are the assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The BJP has a lot at stake in this round of elections as it defends its government in Assam and Puducherry and goes all-out to wrest power from Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in West Bengal. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the BJP is trying hard to expand its base.2027 will be another busy year electorally for the BJP president as seven states, including Uttar Pradesh, will vote to elect new assemblies. The other six are: Gujarat, Goa, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Himachal and Manipur.Chhattisgarh, a state which played a key role in giving prominence to Nitin Nabin, will vote in 2028 along with eight other states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Karnataka, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya. Nitin Nabin was the party in charge in Chhattisgarh in the 2022 assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.And finally, 2029 will see the BJP under Nitin Nabin go all out for a record fourth consecutive victory in the general elections.The five-time Bihar MLA, who is widely recognised for his organisational acumen and administrative experience, will play a key role in anchoring the BJP's election efforts.More than the opposition parties, his toughest competition will come from his predecessors in the party who have led the party to great electoral successes since 2014.With coalitions becoming an integral part of today’s politics, Nitin Nabin will also have to play an important role in working with the party’s regional allies in different states.The appointment of 45-year-old Nitin marks a generational shift in the BJP’s leadership role and has been hailed by all the party leaders. However, for Nitin Nabin, this comes as a challenge as he faces the difficult task of managing the many senior leaders who have decades of experience and some of whom were hopeful of getting the coveted top BJP post.While on the one hand he would want to use their experience to the hilt, on the other hand he would have to ensure to keep them all in good humour for the smooth functioning of the party.For Nitin Nabin, the youth and Gen Z outreach will be both personal and political. Nabin has become the first millennial born post-Emergency president of the BJP.Thus, he must make fresh attempts to connect with Gen Z voters born after 1997, a voter base critical in upcoming assembly elections. This outreach will also test whether the BJP’s ""25-year vision"" resonates with young voters to be converted into election polls or not.Soon after assuming the party president post, he appealed to the youth to enter politics to fulfil PM Modi 's resolve of making India developed.""On August 15, 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called upon the country's youth to enter public life. I want to ask the country's youth that keeping distance from politics is not the solution but making active contributions,"" he said.""At the same time, I would also like to point out to the youths that there is no shortcut in politics. Politics is not a 100-metre race but a marathon where one's stamina and not speed is tested. Come forward and let's work on this political pitch keeping our roots strong,"" he added.In his address after taking charge, Nabin said that this day is ""a moment of resolve"" for him, as he is not just assuming a post but also the ""ideology, traditions, and the responsibility of a nationalist movement of the party"".""We are associated with such a political party, where politics is not power, it is spiritual practice, not indulgence, but sacrifice. It is not luxury and comfort, it is austerity. Politics is not a position of authority, it is responsibility,"" Nabin said.He asked party leaders and workers to make an all-out effort to ensure the BJP's success in the upcoming assembly polls in five states, including West Bengal, to protect the ""Sanatan traditions and faith"" and the country from demographic changes.PM Modi led the party in congratulating Nitin Nabin and said, ""To put it in the language of today's youth, Nitin ji himself is, in a way, a millennial."" He elaborated that 45-year-old Nabin belongs to a generation that has witnessed major economic, social and technological transformations, saying, ""He belongs to the generation that received information from the radio in their childhood and is now an active user of AI. ""Highlighting the importance of the coming decades, PM Modi said, ""The next 25 years are very important. This is the period when a developed India is to be built, and it is destined to happen."" He expressed confidence that Nitin Nabin would carry forward the party's legacy, adding, ""At the beginning of this crucial period, our Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP.""Stressing on Nabin’s important role ahead, PM Modi said: ""When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is the boss, and I am a party worker. Now Honourable Nitin Nabin ji is the president of all of us, and his responsibility is not just to manage the BJP, but also to ensure coordination among all NDA allies.""However, the Congress was quick to mock the BJP’s election process. The ruling party announced the president first and then stated that there would be an election, but there was none, the Congress said.The opposition party also took a dig at Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, saying he is unhappy as he did not get anything to ""manipulate"" in this process.""Gyanesh Kumar wants to resign in protest; he has no role, he can't even influence, he can't even manipulate anything,"" the Congress' media and publicity department head, Pawan Khera, said while targeting the CEC, whom the opposition party has been attacking over alleged irregularities in elections.Congress MP Manickam Tagore claimed that key decisions in the BJP are taken only by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah .""There is no democracy in the BJP, only HM Amit Shah and PM Modi take the decisions, and they have proved it again... What is the work of the returning officer when there is no election? We hold elections in Congress, and Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor were candidates, and voting took place. This is called democracy. PM Modi and Amit Shah want to take over the role of all the workers... BJP is an authoritative party and moving towards dictatorship,"" he said.Congress ally Rashtriya Janata Dal also criticised the BJP, with MP Manoj Jha saying, ""Don’t call it an election... an election is only called when there are two or more choices. Nevertheless, he has become the national president, and I extend my best wishes to him.""Born on May 23, 1980, in Jharkhand's Ranchi, Nabin entered electoral politics at a young age and was first elected to the Bihar legislative assembly in 2006 from the Patna West Assembly constituency. Since 2010, Nabin has been elected from the Bankipur assembly constituency in 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025, thereby becoming a five-time MLA. He has held key portfolios like road construction, urban development & housing and law in the Bihar government as a cabinet minister.Nabin’s soft demeanour, which may have played a key role in his elevation as BJP president, will be put to the ultimate test as he navigates the complexities of his new role.","Nitin Nabin formally took charge as the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party today. His immediate challenge is the assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The appointment of 45-year-old Nitin marks a generational shift in the BJP’s leadership role.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126819173,imgsize-947951,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi-presents-a-bouquet-to-newly-elected-bjp-president-nitin-nabin-ani-photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India has reportedly asked dependents of Mission & Post officials in Bangladesh to return home as a precautionary step, according to ANI sources. However, they added that the the Indian Mission and all Posts continue to remain open and fully operational.Ties between New Delhi and Dhaka have remained strained since the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus assumed office following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024, with India continuing to flag concerns over the safety of minority communities., especially Hindus.On January 9, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India was continuing to see “a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists”, stressing that such incidents must be addressed “swiftly and firmly”.Relations faced another setback following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising, was killed in December amid heightened political tensions, sparking unrest in several areas. Protests also erupted after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Meanwhile, from exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for the instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","India has reportedly asked dependents of Mission & Post officials in Bangladesh to return home as a precautionary step.

"Voluntary contributions to BJP up 54% to Rs 6,125cr in 2024-25",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/voluntary-contributions-to-bjp-up-54-to-rs-6125cr-in-2024-25/articleshow/126871455.cms,"NEW DELHI: Voluntary contributions received by BJP in 2024-25 rose almost 54% to Rs 6,125 crore from Rs 3,967 crore in 2023-24, with the Rs 2,158 crore increase more than compensating for the party's perceived loss of income on account of the scrapping of electoral bonds by Supreme Court in Feb 2024.The party in office at Centre had earned almost Rs 1,686 crore via the bonds route in 2023-24. The elimination of bonds as an anonymous source of political funding by corporates corresponded with a nearly three-fold rise in donations from companies and organisations declared by BJP in its annual audit report for 2024-25. As per the report filed with EC, corporate donations to BJP rose to Rs 5,422 crore from Rs 1,885 crore in 2023-24.Congress, in its 2024-25 annual audit report filed earlier, had declared a total income of Rs 918 crore and expenditure of Rs 1,112 crore.The main opposition party's receipts via grants, donations and contributions saw a nearly 54% dip to Rs 522 crore from Rs 1,130 crore in 2023-24. This may be on account of the elimination of bonds, considering Congress had raised almost Rs 828 crore through this route in 2023-24.Individual donors contributed Rs 641 crore to BJP in the last fiscal, up from Rs 240 crore in 2023-24.Of the total Rs 6,769 crore income declared by BJP in its annual audit report for 2024-25 - up from Rs 4,340 crore declared in 2023-24 - Rs 6,125 crore came from voluntary contributions, Rs 634 crore as interest from banks, Rs 5.7 crore as fees and subscriptions and Rs 4.5 crore as 'other income'.On the expenditure side, BJP spent a total of Rs 3,775 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 3,335 crore was for election propaganda. This is almost double the Rs 1,754 crore it had spent under the same head in 2023-24. Congress election expenditure in 2024-25 stood at Rs 896 crore, up from Rs 620 crore in 2023-24.Electronic media publicity saw the highest spend by BJP in the last financial year, touching almost Rs 1,125 crore compared to Rs 435 crore in 2023-24.Hoardings cost the BJP nearly Rs 107 crore; air travel, Rs 583 crore; and financial assistance to candidates, Rs 313 crore. Another Rs 91 crore was spent on morchas and rallies, while meeting expenses amounted to nearly Rs 52 crore.Having started 2024-25 with a general fund opening balance of Rs 9,170 crore, BJP ended the year with a surplus of Rs 2,995 crore, which made for a closing balance of Rs 12,164 crore.","Voluntary contributions received by BJP in 2024-25 rose almost 54% to Rs 6,125 crore from Rs 3,967 crore in 2023-24.

The wishlist: What comes next for India?

“Ecstatic! Hell yeah, I’ve been waiting for this all my life.” Linkin Park fan Joel’s words almost encapsulate the emotions of all the Indian millennials and Gen Zs who have been waiting to see the iconic rock band live.“They've been with me from my tiny MP3 player to my current smartphone,” he adds.“They have ruled all my yearly music wraps. Seeing them perform live is a dream come true for all nu metal fans,” says Saurav Kumar, who has been a fan since 2007.The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. The rock septet is also set to perform at Lollapalooza 2026, which is also supercharged with other headliners like Playboi Carti, Fuji Kaze, and many more artists on the lineup.Legendary performers like The Lumineers and John Mayer will be setting their solo stages for the Indian fans this year too.What’s exciting is that these events talk about the musical schedule for just two months into the year.Keeping 2025 in hindsight, the year that set the stage for global superstars like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil, it is only left to our imagination what the rest of 2026 holds.This only goes to show that India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues, but a very significant stop.Or as Naman Pugalia, the chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, puts it, “India is no longer a wildcard on the touring circuit but a permanent hotspot.”India has rapidly moved to become a primary market for major international music artists when weighing their tour route. In 2017, when Justin Bieber announced India as his stop, the Beliebers had a meltdown.Hosting international stars has not been a new thing for India.In 1996, the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, performed in Mumbai. However, the event was very much driven by novelty or an elite audience. But the landscape is shifting swiftly, and the change is driven by both the global promoters and a homegrown audience ready to show up for the live experience in sizable numbers.Naman Pugalia says, “India has become one of the fastest-growing live entertainment markets globally, with a population of 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding base of global music fans.”And the excitement is palpable, putting in perspective the enthusiasm and active participation of the audience who are ready to cross borders, quite literally, just to see their favourite artists live.Swadha Shankar, who travelled all the way to Ahmedabad from Delhi, shares, “Watching the artists, who filled the silence of your early life with ambition and music that shaped your personality, keeps the flame of passion burning within you.”“Concerts offer collective energy. Music creates a shared experience beyond cities and cultures,” says Gursshheen Gahllen, who most recently attended the Akon concert in Delhi.However, it is not only passion driving the genre, but India has also rapidly developed its infrastructure and management capabilities, which have strengthened the logistical backbone of these live experiences promised to the crowd and have gained more credibility in the eyes of international headliners.Pugalia shares the importance of ever-evolving production standards, which ultimately shape the entertainment ecosystem for these events.“As a rapidly growing economy, India has been a prime hotspot for international artists to connect with an abundantly populous fan community. With the ever-evolving infrastructure for concerts, festivals and live entertainment shows in the country, artists are now joining the bandwagon to woo passionate Indian fans.”India stood the test of quality in front of major touring acts.Coldplay, during their India stop in 2025, added more dates to accommodate the high demand, with each show being a sell-out. Ed Sheeran’s revisit to India also reaffirmed the stance that India can move tickets at global scale.The buzz in India today is unignorable — and it’s not just audiences feeling it. It’s drawing artists to embrace their roots.Tyla’s Mumbai show was a case in point. With Indian lineage in her family, she stepped out not only as a global artist but as someone reclaiming a piece of heritage. She wore a bindi, spoke to the crowd, and the arena erupted.It is not only the passion that is driving the young crowd to these musical gatherings. Logistically, accessibility and awareness have shaped the fulfilment of their interests on a great scale.Affluent millennials, typically aged between 25 and 40 with rising disposable incomes, form the core audience for these concerts. They are willing to stay updated, buy tickets and get onboard with the firsthand experience of witnessing it all live.“When my friends first asked me to join them for a concert in 2022, I got very curious. ‘What could be the difference between streaming on a phone and seeing them live?’” says Mohammad Sarim, “And since then, I have attended more than 15 concerts by different artists.”Music fans are no longer passive consumers through online platforms; they are very inclined to follow artist journeys and travel to cities for shows. This contributes significantly towards boosting an economy that can cater to the quality demands of hosting these global stars.“35% of Coldplay’s audience in Ahmedabad came from non-metro cities, underlining the fact that demand extends far beyond traditional urban hubs,” said Naman Pugalia when asked about the shift in Indian audience towards the live experience.This is not only driving ticket sales, but the travel pattern is shaping a new “concert tourism” market.“We travelled in a luxury sleeper bus from Delhi to Ahmedabad. A friend joining from Mumbai through his connections was able to arrange lavish rooms when Ahmedabad was out of rooms,” Swadha shares about her travel and accommodation.This movement of fans across states has turned concerts into economic events that extend beyond ticket sales, benefiting airlines, hotels, transport services, food outlets and local vendors.According to the EY–Parthenon and BookMyShow report, India’s Rising Concert Economy, India’s organised live events segment crossed Rs 12,000 crore in 2024 and is projected to grow at around 18–19% annually over the next few years.The broader media and entertainment sector crossed Rs 2.5 trillion in 2024, with live events among its fastest-growing segments, according to the FICCI–EY Media & Entertainment Report.Ticketing data also shows Tier-II cities now contribute close to 35–38% of demand, reflecting a sharp expansion beyond metros.For global artists, India’s scale compensates for relatively lower ticket pricing. Volume over price has become the Indian formula, making the market commercially viable while culturally powerful.While international stars have been creating a frenzy, the Indian superstars are not falling behind. 2025 not only saw a big gathering for the foreign names, but the household names also sent waves of wonder during their Indian and international stages.Diljit Dosanjh’s high-voltage “Dil-Luminati” tour powered through North America, Europe, and the Middle East, with sell-out arena dates across cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles, London, and Dubai.AR Rahman continued to draw packed houses with his “Harmony of Hearts” shows across India and major overseas markets, including the US, Canada, the UK, and the Gulf. Sunidhi Chauhan’s “I Am Home” tour kept venues buzzing from Mumbai to Melbourne.Arijit Singh sold out arena nights in Dubai, London, Birmingham, Sydney, and Toronto, underlining his unmatched global pull. And the world took notes. His international footprint most recently showed up with his Ed Sheeran collaboration on the superhit “Sapphire.”And this is only part of the story: Shreya Ghoshal, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, and several others continue to command international stages with ease.Historically, India was not a default stop on world tours.While Indian fans resonated deeply with global music, logistical challenges, visa delays, security concerns and weak event management often deterred artists.Metallica’s cancelled 2011 India show remains a cautionary tale. The event was postponed and later called off entirely, triggering riots and arrests, and damaging India’s reputation among global promoters.But stakeholders have gradually worked to flip that script.“We’ve spent years working closely with global promoters, agents and artist teams, ensuring India is not just a stop but a destination that matches global benchmarks,” Pugalia says.Audience management has also improved.“There were clear signboards, route guides and transport information shared with tickets,” Gursshheen notes. “There was a large team managing queues and seating.”Yet challenges remain.“Parking, public washrooms and security are still issues,” Sarim says. “I’ve lost two phones at concerts.”Recent incidents, including physical altercations at concerts like Karan Aujla’s Gurgaon show, highlight the need for better civic sense and crowd discipline.As demand continues to outpace infrastructure, experts stress that long-term success will depend not just on fan passion, but on governance, public conduct and sustained investment in large-capacity venues.For many touring artists, India has evolved from a novelty stop to a meaningful fan engagement market. Several trends illustrate this shift. From global streams to live public reception clearl reflect the massive shift in people’s reception.Brands and sponsors are also walking the extra mile to elevate the experience by extending the space to a shared experience with merchandise, interactive spaces, photobooths and other amenities designed for the fans to not just attend the shows but an extension of it.Among all this, for an economy like India, affordability plays a huge role. However, population scale compensates for that gap, placing India in a competitive space.Dua Lipa's Mumbai concert in November 2024 drew 35,000 fans, generating crores despite the discounted tiers. Enrique Iglesias' Oct 2025 MMRDA show was also sold out in hours to lakhs of millennials, turning volume into viable economics where Western acts once saw losses.“With the introduction of the variable pricing model, we have been able to drive a shift in the ‘late-buying’ pattern, where customers have begun making the most of early bird offers or introductory prices,” said Pugalia.This positions India as a market with both cultural influence and commercial viability.India is transitioning from a wildcard destination to a stable touring market.Fans of artists like BTS and Khalid have been waiting to find India on their tour lists. While BTS shared Mumbai being one of the venues for their cancelled Map of the Soul ON:E concert due to the pandemic, their 2026 tour calendar still does not list India as one of their stops.The wishlist for the Indian fans, however, is long.“Charlie Puth!” Sarim speaks up in a heartbeat when asked about who he wishes to see live in India. “Artists like Taylor Swift , Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, and Shakira would find an audience here that is ready and enthusiastic,” Gursshheen shares her list of favourites she awaits.When asked about what drives the artist's plan and how the pitch is prepared, Naman Pugalia shares a meticulous list: “The curation of an artist roster has numerous moving parts and is a fruit of long months of labour. Global touring routes of artists, discovery of new sounds and performers for a landscape, research and matching of potential artist names with the Indian consumer palate and appetite, streaming popularity in a market and deducing from it as also significant diversity across the roster are key factors of consideration. ”Development and repurposing of venues are consistently underway. The touring frequency for concerts in India is seeing a new rise. The long-term seems promising to witness India positioned as a permanent stop on the world touring maps of major artists.Venues are being upgraded, touring frequency is rising, and the momentum is undeniable.But the journey is far from complete. Infrastructure gaps, crowd management challenges and civic behaviour remain critical hurdles. India’s rise as a global concert hotspot will ultimately depend on whether scale is matched with responsibility.","The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil. India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126819023,imgsize-1156523,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
Monkey pox strain links Kerala cases to foreign travel: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monkey-pox-strain-links-kerala-cases-to-foreign-travel-study/articleshow/126869621.cms,"PUNE: A first-of-its-kind genetic study of a newer and more stubborn Mpox variant detected in Kerala has linked those cases to international travel and reported signs of continued human-to-human transmission. The study of Mpox Clade Ib, which has been driving outbreaks in parts of Africa and has since showed up in several countries outside the continent, showed that it is prone to spreading faster and wider than older variants of the virus, necessitating enhanced surveillance.The study, led by researchers from Pune's ICMR-National Institute of Virology and teams from Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories across India, focused on 10 lab-confirmed cases of Mpox Clade Ib in Kerala between Sept 2024 and March 2025.The findings, published in the journal Virology, indicate active viral evolution with implications for disease surveillance and public health preparedness. ""The study confirmed the Mpox virus is indeed mutating, as we found a distinctive mutational pattern that signals sustained human-to-human transmission,"" a researcher said.Scientists found the mutation pattern stronger in Clade Ib than in older forms of the virus, suggesting it continues to adapt while circulating.""The sequences also carried mutations in several genes that had earlier been identified as hotspots in Clade Ib strains from the Democratic Republic of Congo, pointing to evolutionary convergence across different regions,"" a scientist involved in the study said.A new mutation was detected in six of the 10 cases. The researchers studied patients' symptoms, viral load, immune response and the full genetic sequences of the virus. The findings showed that the virus arrived in India not through one carrier but as part of a wider regional spread linked to international travel.Epidemiological analysis showed nine of the 10 patients had travelled abroad prior to testing positive for the strain. Local transmission was noted in one person.","First-of-its-kind genetic study of a newer and more stubborn Mpox variant detected in Kerala has linked those cases to international travel.

MUMBAI: India’s new Shanti Act gives American firms an opportunity to collaborate in the fast-growing area of nuclear energy, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, New’s Delhi’s ambassador in Washington, has said.“As interests of the India-US partnership continuously converge and align in this space, American firms can now compete on a level playing field for one of the world’s largest nuclear markets,’’ Kwatra wrote recently in The Hill, an American newspaper and digital media company based in Washington DC. The Shanti Act (Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India) was cleared last month to repeal Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010.Kwatra pointed out that the act opened up the Indian nuclear sector energy to private and foreign investment. It also aligns India’s liability regime with international norms while protecting its non-proliferation commitments, regulatory autonomy and sovereign oversight. “With maturity, India is joining the widely adopted template of global operative norms in the civil nuclear energy sector,’’ Kwatra wrote.According to him, India’s energy demand will grow faster than any major economy’s over the next decade. Its nuclear capacity now is around nine gigawatts, with a target of 100 gigawatts by 2047.Kwatra listed many potential collaborations that are now viable. These include partnerships involving advanced reactors, small modular reactors, new technology streams -- including in the field of nuclear fusion -- integration of new compute capabilities in nuclear power generation systems, fuel services, component manufacturing partnerships and safety systems.","India’s new Shanti Act gives American firms an opportunity to collaborate in the fast-growing area of nuclear energy.

Nearly 100 percent of applications are now being submitted and processed through the UCC portal, making the process completely faceless and eliminating the need for applicants to visit government offices or interact with officials in person.According to the government, robust safeguards ensure that citizens’ personal data remains confidential. Once an application is approved by a competent authority, officials can no longer access the applicant’s private information. The data can only be viewed by the applicant through a verification process, significantly reducing the risk of misuse or identity disclosure.Over the past year, residents have used the UCC platform for a range of services, including marriage and divorce registration, registration of wills, live-in relationship registration and termination of live-in relationships.Officials said certificates are now being issued in an average of five days, saving time and simplifying compliance.Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the implementation of the UCC had answered critics who had raised doubts about privacy and feasibility.

The move will prohibit environmentally hazardous human activities within the earmarked zone of 243 sq km.Prohibited activities within the ESZ include commercial mining, stone quarrying and crushing units; setting up of industries causing water, air, soil and noise pollution; setting up of brick kilns; and erection of new wind mills among others. Ninety-four villages fall within the zone.The sanctuary, situated approximately 80 km north of the picturesque Lake City of Udaipur, is rich in flora and fauna.

New Global Index Puts India Ahead Of US And China, Shifting Debate From Power To Responsibility

NEW DELHI: Singapore ranked first and India 16th in the Responsible Nations' Index (RNI) launched by former president Ram Nath Kovind here on Monday.Switzerland was second, Denmark third and the Central African Republic stood last on the 154-nation index.India's neighbour Pakistan was in the 90th place. China was ranked 68th and the US 66th, according to the RNI.Kovind launched the RNI, a first-of-its-kind global index that evaluates countries based on how responsibly they exercise power towards their citizens, global community and the planet.The RNI is a global evaluative framework developed by the think tank World Intellectual Foundation (WIF) in academic collaboration with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and methodological validation by the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Mumbai.Kovind underlined the importance of ethical governance, inclusive development, and moral responsibility in shaping sustainable national and global futures.""The index is not a scoreboard which increases competition, but a mirror of morality and responsibility which reflects if countries are doing justice to their citizens,"" he said.The index is anchored in three core dimensions -- internal responsibility, environmental responsibility and external responsibility.The RNI has been operationalised through seven dimensions, 15 aspects and 58 indicators.Sudhanshu Mittal, Founder and Secretary, WIF, said the RNI represents a shift from power-centric assessments to responsibility-centric evaluation of nations.""The Responsible Nations Index asks a fundamental question - how responsibly does a nation exercise its power? Prosperity without responsibility is unsustainable. The RNI seeks to encourage ethical governance, humane development and global stewardship,"" he said.","Singapore ranked first and India 16th in the Responsible Nations' Index (RNI) launched by former president Ram Nath Kovind.

NEW DELHI: Amid recent criticism that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has not been doing enough on the ground, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday said that working in national interest is a collective responsibility of society and not of any one individual or organisation, stressing that the Sangh is playing its role alongside others committed to nation-building.Interacting with prominent citizens from the Saurashtra–Kutch region at Seva Bharati Bhavan as part of the RSS centenary year outreach, Bhagwat said the Sangh stands with everyone engaged in selfless national service, irrespective of formal association with the organisation.Reflecting on the RSS’s journey, Bhagwat said the organisation’s growth despite decades of opposition, neglect and restrictions was rooted in the support of Hindu society. Anyone working honestly in the national interest, he said, is regarded by the Sangh as its own volunteer.Addressing perceptions about the organisation’s functioning, Bhagwat rejected the idea that the RSS operates through “remote control”. He said its work is driven by values, affection and mutual trust. Volunteers are shaped through shakhas to think independently and take decisions guided by conscience in the larger social interest.Explaining Hindutva, Bhagwat described it as a way of life rather than a narrow identity, adding that India’s constitutional philosophy reflects the same civilisational ethos. India’s inclusive character, he said, is why people of all faiths and traditions find space here.On globalisation, Bhagwat said India’s idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam offers a moral alternative to market-driven models. “While some see the world as a marketplace, India views it as one family,” he said.During an interaction, he described Gen Z as sincere and open-minded, calling for better engagement with young people. He also cautioned against allowing social media to dominate thinking, stressing that it must remain a tool used responsibly in national interest.The programme was attended by RSS functionaries and professionals from industry, healthcare, law and academia.","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat says working in national interest is collective responsibility of society.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management, Centre's pollution watchdog, on Tuesday revoked the GRAP-IV restrictions in Delhi-NCR, citing an improvement in air quality.In its order, CAQM stated that measures under Stage 1, 2, and 3 of the revised GRAP will continue to remain in effect.“While GRAP Stage 4 is being revoked, considering the winter season when weather conditions may not always be favourable, and to ensure AQI levels do not deteriorate further, citizens are urged to strictly follow the citizen charter under GRAP Stage 1, 2, and 3,” the order stated.This decision comes just three days after the commission had reimposed the measure. On Saturday, CAQM had brought back GRAP-IV in the region after air quality levels slipped into the ‘severe’ category.The region has been grappling with high pollution levels for several months now.GRAP Stage IV is activated when the Air Quality Index (AQI) crosses 450, entering the ‘severe+’ category.During Stage IV, private vehicles are not completely banned. Restrictions depend mainly on emission standards and fuel type. Vehicles that meet the prescribed norms are allowed to operate, while older vehicles face stricter curbs. Specifically, BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles are prohibited from operating in Delhi-NCR at this stage, except those serving essential services.","The Commission for Air Quality Management, Centre's pollution watchdog, on Tuesday revoked the GRAP-IV restrictions in Delhi-NCR.

The governor demanded that the national anthem be played after the Tamil anthem . When Speaker M Appavu refused, Ravi walked out of the House without reading the opening address.

. When Speaker M Appavu refused, Ravi walked out of the House without reading the opening address. As the governor left, MLAs from the ruling DMK and its allies stood up and raised slogans, creating a din in which nothing could be clearly comprehended.

Reacting, CM Stalin accused the governor of “walking out yet again in violation of rules, traditions and ethos,” and said such conduct was unbecoming of the high constitutional office Ravi holds. He said the walkout was an insult to the House and its dignity, and that the actions of the governor insulted the 100-year-old Assembly.

Stalin recalled a remark by former CM C N Annadurai, saying, “Why does a goat need a beard, and why does a state need a governor?”

Immediately after the walkout, the assembly adopted a resolution moved by Stalin stating that only the government-prepared customary address would go on official record. Thanking the MLAs for adopting the resolution, the CM said it was not appropriate that the Governor refuses every year to read out the government’s speech.

Stalin also asserted that the DMK would make efforts in Parliament, with the support of like-minded parties, to amend the Constitution and remove provisions mandating the Governor’s address at the start of the year.

Minutes later, the Raj Bhavan (Lok Bhavan) issued a 13-point statement explaining why the governor had “declined” to read the address. It alleged that the speech contained “ numerous unsubstantiated claims and misleading statements ” and said “several crucial issues troubling the people are ignored.”

” and said “several crucial issues troubling the people are ignored.” The Raj Bhavan further alleged that the Governor was prevented from speaking inside the House, claiming that his mic “ was repeatedly switched off and he was not allowed to speak. ” It accused the government of disrespecting the national anthem, stating that the “ National Anthem is yet again insulted and the fundamental Constitutional duty disregarded.”

” It accused the government of disrespecting the national anthem, stating that the “ and the fundamental Constitutional duty disregarded.” The statement listed a range of issues it said were ignored in the government-prepared address, including the state’s actual investment figures, rising crimes against women and Dalits, drug abuse among youth, a high rate of suicides, declining education standards, vacant faculty positions, defunct village panchayats, mismanaged temples, stressed MSME sectors, and widespread discontent among lower-rung employees. The statement claimed that these critical concerns had been “bypassed” and remained unaddressed.

NEW DELHI: Events unfolded rapidly inside the Tamil Nadu Assembly on Tuesday as Governor R N Ravi walked out of the House without delivering his customary address, alleging, among other things, “inaccuracies” in the DMK government-prepared text, which triggered a sharp response from chief minister M K Stalin.This was the fourth such walkout by Ravi since he assumed office in 2021.The episode began at the start of the Assembly session when governor Ravi arrived to address the House, with leaders from multiple political parties present.The national anthem once again emerged as a key point of disagreement. While Ravi has been insisting that it be played at the commencement of the customary address, the state government maintains that the Tamil anthem is traditionally played at the beginning and the national anthem at the end.Stalin said governors creating trouble was not unique to Tamil Nadu and was happening in several states. Questioning the relevance of the practice itself, he said that when a governor repeatedly violates the convention of reading out the government’s policy statement, “a question naturally arises as to why such a rule/practice should exist.”Calling the Governor’s conduct regrettable, Stalin said it went against the sentiments of the “8.5 crore Tamil people.”The confrontation follows a pattern seen in recent years. In 2022, when Ravi made his maiden address to the House, the main opposition AIADMK walked out. In 2023, Ravi abruptly walked out while Stalin pointed to deviations from the government-prepared text, including the omission of references to the Dravidian model of governance. The Chief Minister then piloted a resolution to record only the pre-approved state-prepared text, which was adopted by the House.In 2024, Ravi declined to read out the customary inaugural address prepared by the DMK government and again walked out of the Assembly. The Lok Bhavan later said the address contained passages with misleading claims far from the truth and that “reading them would have amounted to the Governor's address becoming a constitutional travesty.”","The governor demanded that the national anthem be played after the Tamil anthem.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government has approved the modernisation of bus terminals in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Sangrur, Patiala and Bathinda through a structured Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to strengthen public transport infrastructure.Transport Minister Laljit Singh Bhullar said on Saturday the decision was taken under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann with the objective of improving passenger facilities, safety, accessibility and overall efficiency at major transport hubs.He said the bus terminals serve as key connectivity points for both rural and urban populations and play an important role in inter-state travel to neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan.According to the minister, Ludhiana and Jalandhar bus terminals handle between 75,000 and one lakh passengers daily, while Patiala and Bathinda witness footfall of around 50,000 passengers every day.Bhullar said the projects will be implemented under Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer or Build-Operate-Transfer models to ensure quality services while maintaining fiscal prudence.The modernisation will focus on improving waiting areas, sanitation facilities, lighting, signage, organised boarding systems and parking arrangements, along with better crowd management during peak hours.He said provisions for barrier-free access will be included to ensure ease of movement for senior citizens and persons with disabilities.The minister added that the upgraded terminals will also be developed as integrated urban hubs with commercial and service facilities, subject to applicable norms, to improve passenger convenience and ensure long-term sustainability.","The Punjab government has approved the modernisation of bus terminals in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Sangrur, Patiala and Bathinda.

Tobacco puts 1 in 10 at oral cancer risk among Nicobarese in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tobacco-puts-1-in-10-at-oral-cancer-risk-among-nicobarese-in-india/articleshow/126761800.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Nearly one in ten adults from the Nicobarese tribal community living on Car Nicobar Island shows signs of oral lesions that could potentially turn cancerous, a large community-based study has found, underlining the heavy health toll of smokeless tobacco and alcohol use in a remote island population.The study, conducted by the ICMR–Regional Medical Research Centre and published on Springer Nature Link, examined over 2,600 adults across 10 villages on the island. Researchers found that 9.92% of those screened had oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), while 0.19% were already diagnosed with oral cancer.OPMDs are conditions associated with an increased risk of cancers of the lip and oral cavity. While some national studies have reported OPMD prevalence as high as 13–14%, oncologists say such figures are far more worrying when concentrated within a single, relatively small community.“Even though some national studies have reported oral potentially malignant disorders in up to 13–14% of the population, finding such high prevalence within a single community is particularly alarming. It reflects concentrated exposure to smokeless tobacco and signals a disproportionately high future burden of oral cancer unless urgent preventive action is taken,” said Dr Amit Upadhyay, senior consultant haematologist and oncologist at PSRI Hospital.Using door-to-door screening and clinical examinations based on World Health Organisation guidelines, the study documented a strong association with tobacco use. Of the 274 individuals identified with oral lesions, 271—nearly 99%—were users of smokeless tobacco. The most common condition was smokeless tobacco keratosis, affecting over 7% of the population. Leukoplakia and oral submucous fibrosis, both known precursors to oral cancer, were also detected, along with two biopsy-confirmed cases of squamous cell carcinoma.Researchers were particularly concerned by the age profile of those affected. Most lesions were found among young and middle-aged adults aged 26–45 years, with men disproportionately impacted, indicating that cancer risk is setting in early. More than 80% of participants reported using smokeless tobacco, often local preparations such as—dried tobacco mixed with slaked lime—while nearly 58% consumed alcohol regularly, including local brews.Experts say the findings also expose deeper structural barriers to early detection in remote tribal settings. Dr Ajoy Roychoudhury, professor and head of the department of oral & maxillofacial surgery, pointed out that geography and health-system gaps are compounding the risk.“Geographic isolation, weak healthcare access, and cultural practices are delaying early detection of tobacco-related oral precancers among Nicobarese communities, making urgent, targeted screening, cessation support, and local awareness programmes critical to prevent avoidable oral cancer burden,” he said.Car Nicobar Island, part of India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, has a population of around 20,000, with the Nicobarese comprising nearly 98% of residents. Limited access to specialised healthcare facilities makes early detection and prevention particularly challenging—and all the more necessary.The authors describe the study as the first population-level evidence documenting oral malignant and potentially malignant lesions among the Nicobarese in India. They call for urgent community-based oral screening, culturally sensitive tobacco-cessation initiatives, and sustained local health education to prevent precancerous lesions from progressing to cancer.Public-health experts warn that without swift, targeted intervention, a largely preventable risk could translate into a long-term cancer burden for India’s tribal and island communities.","Nearly one in ten adults from the Nicobarese tribal community living on Car Nicobar Island shows signs of oral lesions that could potentially turn cancerous.

Hope against Chikungunya: ICMR steps in as cases rise across India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hope-against-chikungunya-icmr-steps-in-as-cases-rise-across-india/articleshow/126761072.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: With Chikungunya continuing to leave thousands of Indians with prolonged and debilitating joint pain, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has moved to fast-track a potential antiviral treatment, inviting Indian companies to help develop and manufacture an experimental RNA-based therapy.The initiative comes amid a sustained disease burden. World Health Organisation surveillance data show India recorded over 30,000 suspected Chikungunya cases and nearly 1,800 laboratory-confirmed cases between January and March 2025, with Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu among the worst-affected states.Against this backdrop, scientists at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have developed an experimental RNA-interference–based therapy that directly targets the Chikungunya virus. In pre-clinical studies, the treatment completely suppressed viral replication in laboratory cell lines and mouse models by silencing two essential viral genes — E2 and nsP1. The findings have prompted ICMR to offer the technology for transfer to industry.Explaining its significance, Dr Ekta Gupta, Professor of Clinical Virology at ILBS, New Delhi, said, “RNA interference blocks viral protein formation by targeting messenger RNA.In Chikungunya, NIV’s RNAi approach targeting E2 and nsP1 has shown complete viral suppression in vivo with a single dose. While laboratory results are encouraging, clinical trials are needed. This is important because there is currently no vaccine or antiviral for a disease that causes significant morbidity in parts of the country. ”Highlighting the clinical potential and challenges, Dr Neha Rastogi, Senior Consultant (Infectious Diseases) at Fortis Gurugram, said, “By targeting key viral genes such as E2 and nsP1, RNA-interference therapy can block viral entry and replication at an early stage and reduce the risk of resistance. The main challenge is safe delivery of RNA into target cells, with lipid nanoparticles showing promise, and combination therapy may further improve effectiveness. ”India has faced major Chikungunya outbreaks in the past. A study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases estimates that the 2006 epidemic affected about 1.39 million people nationwide.

Silver prices hit record high! Silver crosses Rs 3 lakh per kg; gold prices up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-prices-hit-record-high-silver-crosses-rs-3-lakh-per-kg-gold-prices-up/articleshow/126669638.cms,"Representative image

Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time. Gold also rebounded sharply, recovering from last week’s losses.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures jumped Rs 13,553, or 4.71%, to a record Rs 3,01,315 per kg. Gold futures rose nearly Rs 3,000, or over 2%, to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,45,500 per 10 grams.The rally in precious metals followed renewed geopolitical concerns after US President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.In response, the European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion, as reported by ET, citing a Financial Times report. The renewed tensions revived demand for safe-haven assets after easing US-Iran frictions last week had briefly reduced investor interest in gold and silver.Global prices also touched record levels. Spot gold rose 1.7% to $4,673 an ounce, while silver climbed around 3% to about $94 per troy ounce, marking fresh highs in international markets. Silver futures in the overseas market jumped more than 6% to a record $94.35 per ounce.Analysts said that silver has been outperforming gold in recent sessions, supported by strong industrial demand and favourable global trends. Some also pointed to currency movements as an additional factor. The dollar index rose for a third straight week, ending at 99.20, while the USD-INR January 28 futures contract closed higher at 90.8325 on the NSE.Gold, which does not offer interest income, typically benefits when interest rates are low. However, expectations that rate cuts may be delayed have raised the opportunity cost of holding the metal. Despite this, heightened geopolitical risks have continued to support prices.Market participants said precious metals could remain volatile in the near term, with prices driven by developments on the geopolitical front, currency movements and shifts in investor risk appetite.","Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time.

Bharat Coking Coal IPO: Stock lists strongly at over 95% premium; makes strong debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharat-coking-coal-ipo-stock-lists-strongly-at-over-95-premium-makes-strong-debut/articleshow/126669083.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on Monday, nearly doubling from their issue price after the company’s Rs 1,071 crore initial public offering drew overwhelming investor demand.The stock listed at Rs 45 on the NSE, a premium of 95.6% over the issue price of Rs 23 and at Rs 45.21 on the BSE, marking a gain of 96.6%. Ahead of listing, the company was valued at around Rs 10,711 crore.The IPO, which was open for subscription from January 9 to January 13, was entirely an offer for sale by promoter Coal India Limited and did not involve any fresh capital raise. Proceeds from the issue went to the promoter, while public shareholding increased following the listing.Investor interest in the issue was exceptionally strong, with the IPO subscribed 147 times overall. Demand was high across all categories, led by non-institutional investors, while qualified institutional buyers also oversubscribed their portion multiple times. Retail participation was also strong.Market participants had widely expected a strong listing, supported by high grey market premiums and the company’s strategic role in India’s steel value chain.Analysts said that the debut reflected confidence in Bharat Coking Coal’s dominant position in the domestic coking coal segment.Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemon Markets Desk, said the response to the issue highlighted investor belief in the company’s long-term prospects.“The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility,” he said.Garg added that the anchor book provided early validation, while heavy non-institutional participation signalled expectations of listing gains.Bharat Coking Coal is India’s largest producer of coking coal and the only significant domestic supplier of prime coking coal, a key raw material for steel production.Incorporated in 1972, the company operates 34 mines across the Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand and the Raniganj coalfields in West Bengal, comprising both underground and opencast operations. Its key customers include steel producers and power companies.As of April 2024, the company’s estimated coking coal reserves stood at about 7.91 billion tonnes, accounting for nearly 21.5% of India’s total coking coal resources. In FY25, Bharat Coking Coal produced around 58.5% of the country’s domestic coking coal output.The company has steadily ramped up production in recent years. Coal output increased from 30.5 million tonnes in FY22 to about 40.5 million tonnes in FY25, supported by mine expansions, the reopening of discontinued underground mines and efficiency improvements at coal washeries.On the financial front, Bharat Coking Coal reported revenue of Rs 14,401–14,402 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 1,240 crore in FY25. While earnings have seen some volatility due to fluctuations in coal prices and costs, the company remains debt-free and cash-generative. As of September 2025, it had total assets of Rs 18,711 crore and a net worth of Rs 5,831 crore.Following the listing, Coal India’s shareholding in Bharat Coking Coal has reduced to about 90% from 100%, improving the public float while retaining government control.As a wholly owned subsidiary earlier, BCCL has benefited from Coal India’s technical expertise, financial strength and operational scale.Analysts see the stock as a long-term play linked to India’s infrastructure push and growth in steel demand, though they caution that near-term performance will depend on broader market conditions and trends in coal pricing.“The scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector support favourable secondary market sentiment,” Garg said. He added that investors should track earnings consistency over time.","Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on Monday.

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side. On lower end, immediate support remains at ₹143,000 and ₹140,000.Bollinger bands which were flat have expanded with prices on the higher side showcasing a positive run through expectations. This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal. Focus this week will be on US inflation, GDP and speech from President Trump which could keep the volatility along with updates on uncertainties mentioned above.","Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs.

Budget 2026 for taxpayers: Five fixes that can make taxes less taxing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-for-taxpayers-five-fixes-that-can-make-taxes-less-taxing-explained/articleshow/126666769.cms,"The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe.

By Nishant Khemani

One return, one choice

Cut the sting in foreign remittance TCS

NPS withdrawals: clarity needed on taxability

Level the NPS field under the new regime

Time for

joint tax returns

(Nishant Khemani is a chartered accountant and Managing Partner of the Saturn Consulting Group)

Every Union Budget comes with its share of grand announcements, but for ordinary taxpayers, the real test lies in the fine print. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are modest yet meaningful: simplify compliance, nudge long-term savings, and stop treating convenience as a luxury. Here are five changes that could make the tax system smarter, softer and more sensible.The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe. Form 10-IE, required to opt in or out of the new regime, is a classic case of procedural overkill. Many taxpayers either forget to file it or file it incorrectly, losing out on the more beneficial regime. The fix is simple: embed the option directly into the ITR. A single return, a clear choice, no extra forms. Ease of doing business should also mean ease of filing taxes, especially for salaried individuals who neither game the system nor enjoy paperwork.A 20% TCS on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme was introduced to plug tax leakages. The intent is understandable, but the dosage is excessive.For genuine remittances for family support the high TCS blocks liquidity and creates avoidable stress. A more balanced approach would be to reduce TCS to 10%, or introduce a slab system: lower rates up to, say, ₹50 lakh, and higher rates thereafter. Compliance should be encouraged, not coerced.Recent changes to NPS withdrawal rules are a welcome step. Subscribers can now withdraw up to 100% of the corpus if it is within ₹8 lakh, and 80% if it exceeds that limit. This adds flexibility and makes NPS more attractive.But there’s a catch—or rather, a question mark. Till now, only 60% of the corpus was tax-free on maturity. How will the additional 20% be taxed? The Budget should clarify this and remove the ambiguity. Ideally, the extra withdrawal should also be tax-free, reinforcing NPS as a credible retirement pillar rather than a tax puzzle.Under the new tax regime, deductions are scarce, making Section 80CCD(2), the employer contribution to NPS, a rare oasis. However, the additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) is still unavailable in the new regime. Extending this deduction, and enhancing it to ₹1 lakh under the new regime, would send a strong signal. Global evidence is clear: tax incentives drive long-term savings. A stronger NPS today means lower old-age dependency and reduced fiscal pressure tomorrow.India’s tax system still treats married couples as financial strangers. Introducing joint tax returns, with a higher exemption threshold for married couples, would recognise modern household economics—especially double-income families. Such a move would put more disposable income in the hands of families, improve tax equity and align India with global best practices. After all, if households plan together, why shouldn’t they file together?In sum, Budget 2026 doesn’t need fireworks. It needs fine-tuning. Fewer forms, fairer taxes, clearer rules, and smarter incentives could go a long way in making taxation less intimidating—and more humane.","The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers.

PM Modi Flags Off India’s First Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Between Howrah-Guwahati In Bengal

Vande Bharat Sleeper: All About The New Train

Vande Bharat sleeper, Indian Railways’ new train for overnight premium travel, has received overwhelming passenger response, according to the Ministry of Railways.

The City Where Crime Barely Exists: Why Expats and Tourists Feel Safer in Abu Dhabi Than Anywhere Else on Earth

Bottom line: Abu Dhabi's decade of safety, a future of confidence







In a remarkable achievement that underscores its ongoing commitment to public safety, Abu Dhabi has once again been named the world’s safest city in the latest Numbeo Global Safety Index, marking the tenth consecutive year the UAE capital has topped the global rankings. The 2026 safety report evaluated 400 cities across more than 150 countries and placed Abu Dhabi at number one for overall safety, including walking alone safely in broad daylight and at night, consolidating its status as a global leader in urban security and quality of life.The news has been celebrated not just locally but internationally, as the emirate continues to leverage advanced technology, proactive policing strategies, and community engagement to create a city where residents, expatriates, tourists, and workers feel secure at all hours.Abu Dhabi’s latest triumph continues a decade-long positive trend that began in 2017, when it first captured the world’s No. 1 safety ranking. Ever since, the capital has retained this title, outpacing major global cities and reinforcing confidence in its public safety infrastructure.According to Numbeo, a crowdsourced database widely used in global cost of living and quality-of-life comparisons, Abu Dhabi excels in perceived safety from crime and comfort in public spaces.Its top ranking in “safety when walking alone at night” and “safety when walking alone during the day” reflects widespread public confidence, a core measure in the index that resonates with both locals and visitors.Experts say this consistency is not accidental. Unlike cities that fluctuate year to year, Abu Dhabi’s systematic approach of blending technology, human policing and urban design, underpins its decade-long dominance.Behind the ranking lies an evolving model of public safety that integrates cutting-edge technology with forward-leaning strategies. Major General Ahmed Saif bin Zaitoon Al Muhairi, Commander-in-Chief of Abu Dhabi Police, has repeatedly credited the success to a mix of advanced digital tools, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics that help authorities anticipate and mitigate risks before they escalate into incidents.This data-driven approach includes real-time surveillance, rapid response networks and AI-powered risk assessment that collectively make safety both effective and largely invisible, experienced as peace of mind rather than heavy surveillance. By anticipating potential public safety issues and addressing them early, authorities reduce crime and enhance everyday life for residents and visitors alike.Community outreach and engagement also play a critical role. Abu Dhabi’s police work closely with neighbourhoods, businesses and city institutions to ensure that safety policies reflect community needs and build trust, from school zones to business districts and entertainment hubs.Abu Dhabi’s decade at the top of the safety index has contributed to a broader narrative about its liveability, attractiveness and appeal as a global city of choice. Multiple international rankings have linked safety with quality of life, economic opportunity and tourism appeal, all areas where Abu Dhabi continues to excel.For expatriates, the reassurance of safety has a tangible impact on life decisions. A significant portion of the foreign workforce now sees the UAE, especially Abu Dhabi, as not just a place to work but a place to settle permanently. Recent surveys show that nearly one in five expatriates express a desire to remain in the UAE long term, citing safety, security and stability as key factors.Local authorities have made safety a centerpiece of broader development strategies, connecting public reassurance with ambitious urban plans, community spaces and cultural initiatives that encourage inclusive, open-air living with minimal risk. From parks and waterfront promenades to family-friendly zones and business corridors, safety enhances every aspect of city life.Abu Dhabi is not alone in showcasing Gulf safety leadership. Other emirates and cities across the UAE also make significant global impacts on safety rankings. In the latest Numbeo data, Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman and Sharjah also ranked among the world’s safest cities, while Dubai placed notably high as well, illustrating the UAE’s regional strength in secure living environments.Further afield, broader UAE safety rankings have placed the country itself among the top safest nations in the world, reflecting not just urban safety but national policies that prioritise low crime, public trust, and cohesive civic engagement. According to the broader Numbeo Safety Index, the UAE recently secured the title of the safest country globally, ahead of other high-ranking nations, thanks to consistent low crime rates, high perceptions of personal safety, and low discrimination indices.One of the most striking aspects of Abu Dhabi’s ranking is its dual strength in daytime and nighttime safety, a benchmark that reflects well-lit, secure urban design, effective patrolling and community trust in public spaces. Abu Dhabi regularly ranks at the top for perceived safety at night, an especially meaningful metric for both residents and tourists concerned about crime or harassment after dark.This makes the city not just comfortable for daily life but inviting for tourism, nightlife and leisure activities, which is a rarity among global cities where nighttime security remains a challenge. Travel guides consistently highlight Abu Dhabi as a welcoming destination where visitors can explore cultural venues, beachfronts, markets and public attractions with minimal safety concerns. This is an important draw in a travel environment where safety is a growing priority for global tourists.Abu Dhabi’s decade-long reign as the world’s safest city is more than a headline; it is a symbol of what sustained, strategic action can achieve in urban governance. In a world where many cities face rising crime, social tensions and public anxiety, Abu Dhabi’s approach has delivered consistent results that resonate beyond borders.Security experts note that such an achievement requires holistic policies, not just law enforcement but social cohesion, technology integration and inclusive development. Abu Dhabi’s safety model now serves as a case study for other cities looking to improve urban security without compromising personal freedoms or quality of life.In a period of global uncertainty, from economic pressures to geopolitical tensions, Abu Dhabi’s leadership in safety provides a rare constant and a place where residents can walk freely anytime, families can thrive and visitors can explore without fear. Local reaction reflects pride and reassurance. Many residents credit the city’s low crime environment for enhanced everyday life, from children playing outdoors to women feeling secure walking alone at night.Safety is not just a statistic, it is a lived reality that shapes how people move, work and socialise in the capital. Policing authorities emphasise that the ranking is not a one-time win but part of a long-term commitment. Officials reaffirm that continuous investment in smart systems, training and community programmes ensures that safety is not just achieved, it is sustained.As Abu Dhabi celebrates its tenth consecutive year as the world’s safest city, the achievement stands as a global benchmark for urban governance. It highlights how technology, proactive planning, community engagement and proactive law enforcement can create environments where people feel secure and free.For families, investors, expatriates and travellers, Abu Dhabi’s enduring top ranking is not just recognition. It is a reassuring promise of safety that continues to define the city’s identity in 2026 and sets a standard for cities around the world.",Abu Dhabi has once again been named the world’s safest city in the latest Numbeo Global Safety Index.

Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates are advancing a major shift in private-sector compensation norms with a new minimum wage policy for Emirati workers as a part of the broader efforts to strengthen labour standards and boost Emiratisation. Although the UAE historically did not have a universal minimum wage, recent regulatory changes have introduced a formal floor for Emirati nationals employed in the private sector. This move is being closely watched by employers, economists and expatriate workers alike.As of January 01, 2026, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has mandated that Emirati employees in the private sector must receive a minimum salary of AED 6,000 per month, up from the previous AED 5,000 requirement. This wage floor applies to all new, renewed and amended work permits for Emirati nationals and companies must adjust salaries of currently employed Emiratis to meet this threshold by June 30, 2026. Firms that fail to comply face potential penalties from July 01, 2026, including exclusion from Emiratisation quotas and suspension of new work permits, underscoring the government’s commitment to enforcing the policy.While this new minimum wage applies only to UAE citizens and not to expatriate workers, it marks a significant policy evolution in a labour market long characterised by the absence of a legally binding wage floor for foreign employees. Traditionally, wage levels for non-nationals varied widely across sectors, from skilled professionals earning well above market averages to low-wage labour roles without any statutory minimum, reflecting the UAE’s free-market approach to compensation. Federal law does require that wages be sufficient to meet basic living needs but until now there has been no nationwide minimum wage enforced across the board.The UAE does not have a universal statutory minimum wage across all sectors. However, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued salary guidelines for specific categories of employees that many employers use as benchmarks.Previous guideline-style minimum wage recommendations (e.g., AED 5,000–12,000 for graduates or technicians) noted in some 2025 reports were non-binding and not enforced as legal minima. The new AED 6,000 minimum wage for Emiratis is part of the UAE’s broader Emiratisation strategy to promote citizen participation in the private workforce and ensure competitive, fair compensation.These figures do not represent legally enforceable minimum wages but are widely used as industry standards and visa/salary benchmarks for certain roles in Dubai/UAE. The UAE’s current labour framework (as of 2025) includes no binding minimum wage law, although the MoHRE has the authority to set one in the future.Economists and HR specialists say the policy supports the UAE’s Emiratisation strategy, which aims to increase citizen participation in private-sector employment while also ensuring competitive, fair compensation. Employers now face both an administrative and cultural shift as they adjust payroll systems, modify contracts and align hiring policies with updated labour standards. As the UAE continues to modernise its labour laws, further reforms including potential broader minimum wage frameworks remain part of ongoing discussions among policymakers, workers and business leaders.","From 1 January 2026, the UAE government has set a minimum salary of AED 6,000 per month for Emirati citizens working in the private sector. There is no formal minimum wage for expatriate workers in Dubai or the UAE. Compensation levels vary widely by industry, skill level and contract terms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126642800,imgsize-35956,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-raises-minimum-wages-what-are-the-new-dubai-salaries-for-workers-in-different-sectors.jpg"

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention.The river that flows west instead of east is the Narmada. Extending roughly 1,310 kilometres, it is the fifth-longest river in India. Unlike major rivers such as the Ganga or the Godavari, the Narmada does not flow into the Bay of Bengal. From its point of origin, it maintains a steady westward path before eventually emptying into the Arabian Sea. Only a handful of major Indian rivers follow this course, with the Tapi being another prominent example.The idea that the Narmada flows “backwards” exists simply because most rivers in the region move in the opposite, eastward direction.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. The location is forested and serves as a pilgrimage site. From here, the river begins to move westward. It runs across Madhya Pradesh, briefly crosses Maharashtra, and finally enters Gujarat. Its trip ends near Bharuch, where it enters the Arabian Sea. The river's character alters as it travels. In some areas, it cuts through hills and small valleys, but in others, it spreads out and slows. The upper stretches feel isolated, whereas the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. The upper areas are hilly and forested, with fewer people living nearby. Further west, the land becomes flatter and more open. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well-known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, there is Dhuandhar Falls that send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. Although these places are not vast, they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada River is the fifth-longest river in India.
