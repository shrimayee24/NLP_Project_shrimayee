bail clause not right to favourable outcome: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said it is mandatory to grant a hearing to the victim while deciding bail to an accused under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, failing which the bail would be deemed legally unsustainable.Interpreting Section 15A(5) of the SC/ST (POA) Act, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the provision makes it compulsory that the victim or their counsel must be afforded a meaningful opportunity of being heard while considering a bail application and bail can be cancelled on the ground of violation of this section.The bench clarified that the provision guarantees an opportunity to be heard, not a right to a favourable outcome or to a detailed adjudication of every objection raised by the victim. ""Once the victim has been notified, permitted to participate, and allowed to place objections on record, the statutory mandate stands satisfied,"" it said.""It is beyond cavil that section 15A(5) incorporates the principle of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) for victims under the SC/ST (POA) Act. Where such a right is conferred, the court must provide the victim or their dependent an opportunity of audience, either personally or through counsel, including the special public prosecutor.The statutory right to be heard presupposes that the victim is made aware of the proceedings and is not excluded therefrom,"" the bench said.Referring to earlier verdicts of SC, the bench said, ""The court approved the view taken by Gujarat HC in Hemal Ashwin Jain case which categorically held that failure to provide the victim an opportunity of being heard in bail proceedings constitutes a failure of justice, rendering the order legally unsustainable. This court concluded that the victim or dependent is an active stakeholder in proceedings under the SC/ ST (POA) Act and that compliance with Sections 15A(3) and 15A(5) is mandatory"".The court passed the order on a plea seeking cancellation of bail of an accused. Though the bench said that there was no violation of Section 15A(5) as the victim was given hearing, it, however, quashed the bail order of Madras HC on the ground that the criminal antecedent of the accused was not considered by HC.The top court said the high court order suffers from fatal infirmities as it ignored that the bail for the accused in another case was cancelled after the death of a material witness when he was out on bail. The criminal antecedents of the accused were expressly placed before HC and were recorded in the impugned judgment but HC failed to draw any conclusion from them, it said.",Supreme Court said it is mandatory to grant a hearing to the victim while deciding bail to an accused under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the provision makes it compulsory that the victim or their counsel must be afforded a meaningful opportunity of being heard.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126261732,imgsize-1478930,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit. It grants long-term security and operational freedom. It is not tied to a single employer and does not impose requirements. Key features include full work freedom, self- employment, business ownership, and freelancing without sponsorship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126234204,imgsize-648989,width-400,resizemode-4/bahrain-golden-residency.jpg"

The contract highlights the synergy between the govt and private sector, which will further give impetus to the Make-in-India initiative,” it added.The Rs 1,896 crore contract for the procurement and integration of 48 “Black Shark” heavyweight torpedoes, along with associated equipment, for the Navy’s six Kalvari-class or Scorpene submarines, in turn, was signed with WASS Submarine Systems S.R.L.,Italy.The diesel-electric Scorpene submarines have been constructed by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks in collaboration with the French Naval Group under Project-75 for over Rs 23,000 crore.

"In a historic first, Constitution of India translated in Kashmiri",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-historic-first-constitution-of-india-translated-in-kashmiri/articleshow/126258698.cms,"Constitution in Kashmiri (Ministry of Law)

PM Modi Pens Powerful Letter On Duties And Democracy, Reflects On His Constitutional Journey

SRINAGAR: For decades, scholars had tried to translate the Constitution of India into Kashmiri. That wait has now ended. The translation is now available on the Union law ministry’s website.President Droupadi Murmu released the volume in a red-bound edition decorated with Chinar leaves and traditional Kashmiri decorative art. Prof. Aejaz Mohammad Sheikh of University of Kashmir, who led a 11-member translation panel that worked on the project for over two years, described the work as a “watershed moment” for Kashmiri language.“You now have the Bible of law in Kashmiri. This is not just a transfer of knowledge. It enriches the language itself. It gives Kashmiri the legal and intellectual vocabulary needed to translate science, law and modern knowledge,” Sheikh said.Many experts believe that while Kashmiri language possesses a rich body of translated works, including classics from world literature, the translation of a foundational legal document like the Constitution marks a historic first.“A common Kashmiri can now read the Constitution in their own language.When students see that Kashmiri language can carry the language of law, not just poetry, it changes how they see their mother tongue. It proves that Kashmiri language has the grammar, lexicon and strength to express the most complex ideas. This translation has the ability to move Kashmiri language out of a confined literary circle, allowing it to reach the common masses,” said Sheikh, who is dean of School of Arts, Languages and Literature at the university.A govt official echoed the view. “By incorporating constitutional, legal and administrative terminology, the translation strengthens Kashmiri’s capacity to function as a language of governance and law.” Linguistic experts believe the text should be introduced in schools and made available through voice-based software so it can reach the wider public.Basher Bashir, another member of the translation panel, said the exactness and authenticity had been maintained in the legal text of the Constitution.The project began in Aug 2023 when National Translation Mission (NTM) of Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysuru, approached Sheikh. Fluent in Kashmiri, Urdu and Hindi, and proficient in Sanskrit, the professor agreed to do it. He put together a multidisciplinary team of linguists, academics and legal experts from his university, Satish Vimal of All India Radio (Srinagar), and education department officials.Team members first worked individually, then met to compare and refine their drafts. This was followed by a series of intensive seven-day workshops. The first was held in Mysuru, where legal experts read the Constitution in English while linguists compared it with their Kashmiri translation.. Every term was debated, every phrase tested. Where differences arose, they were discussed until a consensus was reached before moving forward.After the fifth workshop, Sheikh carried out a final, detailed review and submitted the draft. The manuscript was placed online for public feedback for three months by the Union law ministry before the President formally released the final version on Nov 27. The translation uses the standard Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script, adopting a simpler, more accessible style.On Sept 2, 2020, the Union Cabinet had approved Jammu and Kashmir Languages Bill, 2020, recognising five official languages in the UT -- Urdu, Hindi, Kashmiri, Dogri and English. Before the revocation of Article 370, Urdu was the sole official language of the erstwhile J&K state.","President Droupadi Murmu released the volume in a red-bound edition decorated with Chinar leaves and traditional Kashmiri decorative art.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: A court in north Kashmir’s Kupwara granted Tuesday bail to eight policemen, including a DSP, accused of illegally holding and torturing a fellow J&K constable for six days in Feb 2023. The order came after CBI dropped attempt-to-murder charge against the accused.The case stems from a CBI FIR registered on July 26 this year on directions of the Supreme Court, which took cognizance of allegations that constable Khursheed Ahmed Chowhan was unlawfully held at the joint interrogation centre in Kupwara from Feb 20 to Feb 26 and subjected to severe abuse “on the pretext of investigating narcotics-related offences”.Chowhan’s wife Rubeena Akhter had moved the top court after J&K high court declined to order registration of a case. Her petition alleged her husband was beaten with iron rods and wooden sticks, given electric shocks and left critically wounded, with claims of mutilation, grievous harm to private parts, insertion of iron rods and chili powder allegedly forced into his rectum.Acting on the Supreme Court’s July 21 order, CBI filed a chargesheet on Oct 22 this year.On Tuesday, the principal district and sessions judge of Kupwara directed the superintendent of Humhama subsidiary jail in Srinagar to release the accused after they furnish bail and surety bonds of Rs 1 lakh each.Advocate Ahrar Dar, appearing for the accused, said the home department had not granted mandatory sanction to prosecute at the time of filing the chargesheet. He said a “crucial and material change of circumstance” occurred after investigators dropped the most serious counts — IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 326 (grievous hurt by dangerous weapons).“The legal impediment of section 307, which was the cornerstone of the previous bail rejection, no longer exists,” Dar said, adding that the case now rests on less severe charges within the court’s bail jurisdiction. He said CBI opposed bail but the court granted relief after hearing arguments.","A court in north Kashmir’s Kupwara granted Tuesday bail to eight policemen, including a DSP.

Proof needed, not promises

NEW DELHI: When questions are raised about the safety of any food article, India's food regulator will now ask for proof, not promises. From what a product contains and how much Indians actually eat to whether it's safe over time, every claim will have to be backed by data to assess its safety.From Jan 1, 2026, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) has made it mandatory for all submissions seeking a food safety review or changes in food standards to follow a single, standardised format supported by scientific evidence. The move comes after the regulator found that many past requests lacked basic data or a uniform structure, making proper risk assessment difficult.The new rule does not trigger an automatic re-examination of all foods already in the market. It applies only when a stakeholder approaches FSSAI seeking a scientific risk assessment - either for introducing a new product or reviewing an existing one. In such cases, the burden of proving safety will rest with the applicant.Under the new format, submissions must spell out nutritional information, how much Indians consume the product, results of toxicological studies, and evidence on safe intake limits, along with allergy risks and supporting scientific studies.The data will be reviewed by FSSAI's Science and Standards Division and assessed by expert panels, which will decide whether a product can be cleared, continued, restricted or subjected to tighter limits.Officials say the sharper focus on Indian eating habits is crucial as packaged foods become more common and overseas data may not reflect real exposure.""This is an important step to protect public health. Earlier, many foods were approved using limited or incomplete information. Since Indian food habits, portion sizes and sensitivities are very different from those in other countries, asking for proper proof about long-term safety, how much people eat and possible allergy risks helps make food rules more practical, science-based and safer for Indian consumers,"" said Anjali Bhola, dietician at National Cancer Institute, Jhajjar, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.FSSAI has also assured stakeholders that data submitted for risk assessment will be treated as confidential and used only for scientific evaluation and policy decisions. For consumers, the message is simple: when food safety is questioned, evidence will now decide what stays on the plate.","From Jan 1, 2026, all submissions seeking a food safety review or changes in food standards must follow a single, standardised format supported by scientific evidence.

Centred near Mandalay, the quake was followed by a strong aftershock and damaged roads, a bridge and a dam, hampering rescue efforts in Myanmar, which is already grappling with civil war and a humanitarian crisis.

Tremors were felt in China’s Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where houses were damaged, and people were injured near the Myanmar border.

April 1: Gujarat firecracker factory explosion

Most of those killed were migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh who had arrived only two days earlier and were staying with their families inside the premises.

Survivors and local sources said children as young as six were made to work with explosives for very low wages. They were assigned risky tasks such as tying fuses, packing gunpowder and assembling fireworks, often because their small hands were considered suitable for the work.

Many of those killed in Deesa had survived a similar firecracker factory explosion in Harda, Madhya Pradesh, in February 2024, highlighting how the same workers were exposed to deadly risks more than once.

April 22: Pahalgam terror attack

Around 3 PM, terrorists descended from the mountains of Baisaran Valley and opened fire on tourists in the area, known as 'mini Switzerland' for its scenic meadows. Panicked women were seen weeping and searching for their loved ones amid pools of blood as cries for help echoed across the valley.

The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Following the attack, the government suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, shut the Attari-Wagah border and halted visas.

India launched Operation Sindoor on May 6–7 in retaliation, targeting terror hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Indian officials later said over 100 terrorists were killed during the operation.

June 4: RCB’s victory celebrations turn tragic

The police had deployed a large contingent, but managing the crowd proved extremely difficult. The stadium had a capacity of holding 35,000 people, yet around 2 to 3 lakh fans showed up, far exceeding expectations.

Thousands of fans thronged the stadium and surrounding areas, overwhelming security personnel. Many attempted to climb gates, trees, and fences to get a view of the players.

At Vidhana Soudha , Karnataka police used mild cane charges to disperse surging fans during the felicitation program. Panic spread quickly as crowds surged, with people scrambling to climb fences and trees in desperation.

June 12: Ahmedabad Air India crash

Both pilots, senior captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kunder, were fully cleared for duty, and the aircraft’s initial climb seemed normal.

and co-pilot Clive Kunder, were fully cleared for duty, and the aircraft’s initial climb seemed normal. However, within moments, a sudden loss of engine power triggered a series of events that the crew were unable to control.

The flight was carrying 242 people, including 229 passengers and 12 crew members, along with 19 people on the ground who were killed in the impact. The disaster left only one survivor, Indian-origin British national Vishwash Kumar Ramesh.

July 9: Texas Hill country flash flood

The disaster resulted in over 135 confirmed fatalities and estimated economic losses of approximately $1 billion.

Remnants of a tropical storm system stalled over the region, dumping record rainfall in short durations that overwhelmed the Colorado River basin.

The disaster exposed severe vulnerabilities in local drainage infrastructure, prompting a state-wide ""Flood Zone Reassessment"" by the Texas government.

August-September: Monsoon battered the subcontinent

Uttarakhand was hit by flash floods beginning August 5, a disaster that left over 70 people dead or missing, including 11 Indian Army soldiers. Cloudbursts in the Himalayas triggered massive landslides in Kishtwar and Chamoli.

In Punjab and Haryana, the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers overflowed, submerging hundreds of acres of paddy fields just before harvest. From mid to late August, Punjab grappled with the ""Great Punjab Flood"", the worst flood crisis since 1988. Over 1,400 villages were inundated, and the death toll in Punjab alone stood at 57, with over 3.5 million residents affected and 4.8 lakh acres of crops destroyed. The effect was seen in Pakistan too, where over 2 million people were displaced.

In late August, 138 people were killed in the Jammu division due to torrential downpours. Udhampur recorded a historic 629.4 mm of rain in 24 hours on August 27, shattering a record.

September 27: Karur stampede

During a rally for actor-turned-politician Vijay's party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), at Velusamypuram, a crowd crush occurred around 7.45 pm as supporters surged forward to catch a glimpse of the leader’s convoy. The tragedy claimed 39 lives, including at least nine children and 18 women. Additionally, over 100 people sustained crush injuries ranging from suffocation to fractures.

(TVK), at Velusamypuram, a crowd crush occurred around 7.45 pm as supporters surged forward to catch a glimpse of the leader’s convoy. The tragedy claimed 39 lives, including at least nine children and 18 women. Additionally, over 100 people sustained crush injuries ranging from suffocation to fractures. The venue, which anticipated 15,000–30,000 attendees, saw a massive influx of over 50,000 people. The chaos was exacerbated by the leader's 7-hour delay, a failure of the sound system/microphones, and inadequate barricading along the Karur-Erode highway.

Rescue operations were severely hampered as the massive convoy of vehicles and the dense crowd blocked the entry of ambulances. Reports indicated that several attendees had already begun fainting from dehydration and heat exhaustion hours before the crush began.

October 21-October 31: Hurricane Melissa (Category 5)

The storm made a catastrophic landfall in Jamaica at New Hope on October 28, making it the most devastating landfall in history. with wind speeds exceeding 250 km/h, effectively shutting down the island's power grid for weeks. The slow-moving storm caused at least 45 deaths there and more than $130M in infrastructure damage, while over 90,000 people were displaced.

After devastating Jamaica, the storm battered Cuba and the Bahamas, and even though Melissa weakened before reaching here, Haiti suffered severely with 23 confirmed deaths and thousands displaced due to mudslides. The southern islands faced ""salt spray burn,"" where hurricane-force winds coated agricultural land in salt, destroying 80% of the local crop yield for the 2026 harvest season.

Insured losses were estimated at nearly $8 billion. The Caribbean tourism industry faced a complete seasonal shutdown, with cancellations extending well into 2026.

November 3: Northern Afghanistan earthquake

A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck near the border of Samangan and Balkh provinces at a depth of 28km, catching residents asleep in the early hours.

Reports confirmed over 20 fatalities and 300+ injuries, with the number rising as rescuers reached remote mountain villages cut off by landslides.

Significant damage was reported to historical infrastructure in Mazar-i-Sharif, including structural cracks in the outer walls of the Blue Mosque complex.

November 10: Red Fort car bomb blast

At 6:52 pm, a high-intensity vehicle-borne IED exploded in a white i20 car near Gate No. 1 of the Lal Qila Metro Station, just outside the historic Red Fort complex.

The powerful blast killed 15 people, mostly tourists and security personnel, injured dozens more, shattered windowpanes of buildings up to 500 metres away, and burned nearly a dozen nearby vehicles, including e-rickshaws and autos.

Intelligence agencies linked the attack to a ""doctor's module"" terror cell and utilised high-grade explosives, indicating sophisticated logistical support. Afterwards, the National Capital Region (NCR) was placed under a high-security grid. New checkpoints and facial recognition surveillance were permanently installed around all UNESCO heritage sites in Delhi.

November 26-December 2: Cyclone Ditwah

The storm stalled over the island nation of Sri Lanka, causing 410+ deaths and displacing nearly 230,000 people. The economic damage was estimated at $4.1 billion (approx. 4% of GDP).

In India, Chennai's IT corridor faced severe inundation, disrupting operations for global tech firms for 4 days. Reservoirs in coastal Andhra Pradesh breached, flooding the delta farmlands.

The receding waters triggered outbreaks of waterborne diseases in both countries, overwhelming local healthcare systems already strained by the monsoon.

December 14: Bondi Beach mass shooting

Two gunmen, a father and son, opened fire at the crowded beachfront event, resulting in 16 deaths, including one perpetrator, and creating mass panic among holidaymakers.

Authorities classified it as an ISIS-linked terror attack. Police recovered pipe bombs, other explosives and an ISIS flag from the truck belonging to the attackers at the scene that, fortunately, failed to fully detonate.

Australia declared a National Day of Reflection. The incident led to an immediate bipartisan review of hate-group designations and stricter monitoring of online radicalisation hubs.

December 2-December 15: Indigo airline operational collapse

December 3 marked the ""initial meltdown"" phase, where the airline was forced to cancel roughly 200 flights in a single day, signalling the start of a week-long systemic failure. 2 days later, the cancellation number rose to over 1000 flights.

IndiGo's size, high night-flight dependence, and razor-thin utilisation margins made recovery slower than expected. When one pilot timed out, it triggered a 'domino effect.' As IndiGo was packed with passengers but no pilots, fares for other aviation giants also went up.

Major airports saw queues of passengers lined up, as some waited for over 12 hours. The crisis struck many major cities, including Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolkata, and Hyderabad. However, operations normalised later following the government's introduction of a price cap and DGCA’s probe.

December 6: Goa nightclub fire

The fire broke out at approximately 11:45 PM on a Saturday night during a crowded dance party. While initially thought to be a gas cylinder explosion, investigators later confirmed the fire was triggered by the improper use of indoor electrical firecrackers and spread within seconds due to dried palm leaves.

The tragedy was particularly lethal because the building lacked emergency exits, and the main entrance was a narrow lane that prevented fire trucks from getting closer than 400 meters. 23 of the 25 victims died of smoke inhalation/suffocation rather than burns.

The Magisterial Inquiry revealed the club's trade license had expired in March 2024. Meanwhile, the owners, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, flew to Phuket, Thailand, but were arrested after an Interpol Blue Corner Notice.

Murphy’s law worked hard in 2025.A year full of “what else can go wrong”, and then the wrong proceeds to make its way in, perfectly settling down, even stretching through months. A year that felt like a series of hypnic jerks, rather than just dates or headlines changing.Not to sound pessimistic, but 2025, ultimately, became a collision of the good, the bad and the devastating.

Politicians, business leaders, film stars and millions of devotees gathered along the riverbanks, hoping for a calm and spiritual start to the year.The tragedy does not end here. Days later, another stampede claimed lives, this time at New Delhi Railway Station, where at least 18 people, including 14 women and three children, were killed and several others were left injured.On March 28, Myanmar and Thailand were shaken by a 7.7-magnitude earthquake, causing widespread damage to buildings and key infrastructure.A powerful explosion at a firecracker factory and godown in Deesa, north Gujarat, on April 1 claimed 21 lives, with the impact so severe that body parts were found up to 300 metres away.A pleasant vacation in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam turned tragic when 26 people, including one Nepali citizen, died in a terror attack. Terrorists opened fire in Baisaran Valley on April 22, marking one of the deadliest attacks in the Kashmir Valley since the Pulwama carnage in 2019.What was meant to be a celebration turned deadly when a stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on June 4 killed 11 people and injured more than 30 during RCB’s first-ever IPL title celebrations.A tragic crash of Air India Flight AI 171 on June 12 claimed 260 lives when the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plunged seconds after taking off from Ahmedabad on its way to London. The aircraft struck the hostel of Ahmedabad’s BJ Medical College, where young doctors were having their lunch.On July 9, parts of Texas were submerged under rapid floodwaters, after an intense storm system, marking an ominous start to the second half of the year.From August through September, the Indian subcontinent was brought to a standstill by a devastatingly erratic monsoon season. Torrential rains, landslides and cloudbursts wrecked havoc in northern India and other regions.A political rally, a superstar and a huge turnout of people. A scene unfolded on September 27, with a thought: what could have possibly gone wrong? Except that a lot of it did. It only needs a special infrastructure to manage a massive crowd stretched over 2km. 39 people, including many women and children, never made it out alive. Multiple injuries and trauma for many more affected.The Caribbean region saw devastation in the form of one of the most powerful storms of the decade. Rapidly intensifying into a Category 5 storm, Melissa began its trail from October 21 as a tropical storm, gradually upgrading into a Category 1 storm in four days. However, within two days, the storm rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm, causing historical devastation.Deep within the Hindu Kush’s tectonic fault lines, a seismic jolt shook the northern Afghanistan region. This crisis triggered massive landslides, severing vital transit corridors and cutting power across provinces. Settlements crumbled during the late-night tremor, and international monitoring agencies issued orange alert through the PAGER system.A busy evening on November 10 turned out to be a day that would shake the entire nation. A terror incident in the heart of New Delhi that shattered the nation's capital. An attack that later went on to uncover a far more disturbing truth, a “white coat nexus”. The very entities entrusted with lives would later be complicit in a larger, sinister plot. One that stood in a direction opposite to the safety and security of the people they were meant to serve.From November 26 to December 2, 2025, a weak but hydrologically catastrophic tropical storm unleashed unprecedented rainfall on Sri Lanka and Southern India.A happy gathering for “Chanukah by the sea” at one of the most popular beaches in Sydney fell prone to one of the most horrific terror attacks.

One of India’s largest carriers by market share, IndiGo, fell into an operational crisis, after which began a series of delayed flights, cancellations, and much more!The Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire in Arpora, North Goa, is recorded as one of the deadliest fire tragedies in the state's history. Occurring on December 6, at the peak of the 2025 tourist season, the incident exposed a massive web of illegalities and administrative failures.2025 tested the resilience, the limits across borders and institutions. It also forced uncomfortable reckonings. Each tragedy sparked questions that could no longer be postponed about preparedness, accountability, infrastructure, governance and collective responsibility. In many cases, they also triggered change: tighter safety norms, renewed probes, policy corrections, and communities stepping up for one another in moments of collapse.Each tragedy, each crisis has only strengthened the bounce-backs. Pandemic felt like 'the story' to tell the succeeding generation, but the reel is ongoing, and the list goes on.As the year draws to a close, the grief it leaves behind is undeniable, but so is the resolve it has shaped. If 2025 was a reminder of how fragile life and systems can be, it was also a quiet call to build better — with memory, empathy and caution guiding the road ahead.","The month-long Prayagraj Maha Kumbh Mela saw tens of millions of pilgrims arrive, with authorities estimating that nearly 10 crore devotees turned up on Mauni Amavasya alone.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: In a move to curb the spread of anti-national propaganda, a designated NIA court in Srinagar on Tuesday issued a proclamation against three Kashmiris, in an FIR registered by the Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK). Investigators have established their alleged role in propagating content deemed prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India. The court directed them to appear before it by Jan 31, 2026.The proclamation was issued against Mubeen Ahmad Shah, Azizul Hassan Ashai alias Tony Ashai, both residents of Srinagar, and Rifat Wani of Kupwara. All three have been living outside India for a long period.Mubeen Shah, former president of Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is a prominent Kashmir-born businessman who was detained a day before the abrogation of Article 370. He was released from Agra jail in Dec 2019. He subsequently left the country.The CIK, in a statement, described the court ruling as a major crackdown on anti-national propaganda and secessionist misinformation. “These elements were masquerading as news portals, journalists and freelancers, while in reality weaponizing social media platforms such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and WhatsApp to create, upload and circulate fake, motivated, exaggerated, secessionist and out-of-context content,” the CIK statement said.The deliberate objective of this digital misinformation campaign was to incite street violence, disrupt normal life, damage public property, disturb public order and fuel mass unrest, thereby promoting anti-national sentiments and advancing a secessionist agenda aimed at creating disaffection against the Union of India, the statement added.Despite being declared absconders, the accused are notorious for their continued hostile activities and remain highly active on social media platforms, where they persist in peddling false, fabricated and provocative content with the intention of inciting large-scale violence and destabilizing public order in the union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, it added.","A designated NIA court in Srinagar on Tuesday issued a proclamation against three Kashmiris.

"Salt Lines: A forgotten 4,000-km 'living border' reappears in a Mumbai museum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salt-lines-a-forgotten-4000-km-living-border-reappears-in-a-mumbai-museum/articleshow/126206594.cms,".

In the open-air plaza of Mumbai's oldest museum, a long, zig-zag wall of cloth ripples in the breeze. At first glance, it looks like a giant curtain. Step closer to squint at the crimson prints on it and the cloth becomes a partition: neat plant patterns on one side and chaotic termite marks on the other.Block-printed deliberately with dyes from homegrown shrubs like babool and karonda, this 20-metre-long cotton wall at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum quietly leads visitors back to a little-known 4,000-km hedge that once formed a thorny botanical border across India, buzzing with birds and bees.Part hedge, part fence, the Inland Customs Line — a forgotten boundary created by the British in the 19th century to enforce the Empire’s deadly salt tax— is the centrepiece of 'Salt Lines', the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires.Supported by RMZ Foundation and IAF with curatorial Advisor Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the show revisits the colonial 4000 km border of which 2500 constituted a fence of plants known as the Great Hedge of India.Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge--described as ""utterly impassable to man or beast""--was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.“We first stumbled upon the incredible history of the Inland Customs Line when we were doing more general research on… salt,” the artists say. Its scale shocked them: “It seemed improbable to us that such a large botanical infrastructure could have existed for much of the 19th century without everyone knowing about it.”Salt, which had been lightly taxed under earlier Indian rulers and the Mughals, became one of the British Empire’s most lucrative revenue streams after Bengal Presidency governor Robert Clive’s victory at The Battle of Plassey in 1757.Through monopolies and price controls, the East India Company's officials forced peasants and merchants to buy salt from government depots at inflated rates. Even during the catastrophic Bengal famine of 1770, which killed an estimated ten million people, land revenue and salt taxes were collected in full.Originally consisting of thorny branches and deadwood piled into a crude fence, it was designed to stop smugglers from moving coastal salt into British-controlled territories, where it was heavily taxed. From the 1860s, the British began converting it into a living hedge, planting hardy native shrubs, digging trenches, building embankments, and maintaining a patrol road. Under officials such as AO Hume, entire teams tended the hedge, watering, pruning, and replanting it.Between 1867 and 1870, Hume oversaw a dramatic expansion of the hedge. By 1869 it stretched more than 2,300 miles from the Indus to the Mahanadi, patrolled by nearly 12,000 men. The line snaked through what is now Pakistan, skirted Delhi, passed Agra, Jhansi, Hoshangabad, Khandwa, Chandrapur and Raipur, and terminated in present-day Odisha. Where living shrubs failed due to rocky soil or frost, stone walls were erected instead; elsewhere, dry hedges of dwarf Indian plum had to be rebuilt constantly after damage from insects, fire and storms.At its height, the hedge was said to be up to 12 feet high and 14 feet thick, made of tightly trimmed trees and shrubs of babool, Indian plum, carounda, prickly pear, and thuer, depending on the soil and climate, with a thorny creeper woven throughout. By the 1870s, more than 14,000 men were employed to guard and maintain it, making it one of the largest security operations in the subcontinent.“On no branch of their duties have the whole establishment bestowed anything like so much time, labour, care, and thought, as on the rearing of this barrier...after all it must be remembered that our barrier is to the Line what the Great Wall once was to China: alike its greatest work and its chiefest safeguard,"" wrote Hume.The hedge was lost in the archives, say the artists who scoured the National Archives of India, the British Library, the South London Botanical Institute, the Alkazi Collections and more for its history. “We found textual evidence… but no imagery.”To fill the gap, they created speculative visual records such as re-enactments at Sambhar Lake, an important British salt outpost, and AI-generated images, printed using a 19th-century salt process and toned with gold.At the centre of 'Salt Lines' is 'The Hedge of Halomancy' (2025), a 23-minute film. It follows Mayalee, a courtesan known to history for resisting the British. “She refuses the British administrators… when they attempt to replace her traditional salt stipend with cash payments,” the artists explain.Salt, in the film, becomes material and metaphor. A three-dimensional salt crystal acts as “a magical talisman,” linking Mayalee to Hume and, symbolically, to Gandhi’s march to Dandi. In another room called the 'Salt Office', historical salt-tax objects including two photographs of Bombay’s salt satyagraha from the Alkazi Collection sit beside Salt Prints (2024). “Salt is an acid and a base, an amazing symbol of equilibrium,” the artists say.Sound underscores this tension. “The speculative chapters… are underpinned by bansuri and sitar,” says David. The archival sections use “tuba and percussion,” echoing British military bands and their transformation into Indian wedding music.How did the hedge disappear from public imagination? Nature played the first role. “Termites… begin to eat into the hedge,” the artists note. “Winds, rats, tigers stormed through parts of the hedge.” Human anger, it seems, finished the job. “During the 1857 mutiny, people burnt parts of the hedge down in fury.”When the British gained control over salt-producing regions like Sambhar Lake, they found a cheaper way to tax salt at its source. The hedge — expensive and unwieldy — was dismantled on April 1, 1879.Nature reclaimed it. The living shrubs died or were cut; deadwood was carted off by villagers; embankments eroded. Within decades, almost nothing remained. ""The natural world’s resistance not only contributed to the fall of the hedge but also to its utter erasure from history,"" say the artists.Many historians had never heard of it until British writer Roy Moxham rediscovered it in the 1990s, travelling across India to piece together its remnants for his book 'The Great Hedge of India'. “People seldom realise how critical salt is to health,” wrote Moxham. “And yet, it seems inconceivable to me how this incredibly painful part of history, the immense abuse people endured at this time, could be so utterly forgotten. ”When he set out to find the remnants of the Customs Hedge, Moxham had imagined the barrier as a piece of British whimsy constructed to collect a minor tax. Along the way, he realized that the men posted along it, mostly local recruits, worked in isolation for months, patrolling harsh terrain with sticks, whips, and firearms. Those caught bypassing the hedge faced imprisonment. Famine, he discovered, was worsened by the Salt Tax. In 1877–'78, crops failed from poor rains in the North-Western Provinces while grain was exported, causing starvation. Official reports recorded 1.3 million deaths, with most deaths attributed to disease rather than hunger, though salt deficiency increased mortality.""I had assumed it was merely a flamboyant boundary, perhaps fashioned by administrators with fond memories of English hedgerows,"" wrote Moxham. ""It was a terrible discovery to find that it had been constructed, and ruthlessly policed, so as to totally cut off an affordable supply of an absolute necessity of life,"" he concluded.It is fitting that the exhibition sits inside the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai’s oldest, built by the British in 1857 as the Victoria & Albert Museum, Bombay. For the artists, its vitrines and industrial models echo the themes of extraction in the exhibition while Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the museum’s managing trustee and director, says 'Salt Lines' allows the institution to “engage with the nature of colonial artistic production… including local people who harvested and consumed salt. ”As visitors leave 'Salt Lines', Hylozoic/Desires offer a last thought — a reminder of what the exhibition ultimately attempts: “All we know is that the artist’s work is to research rigorously, and then… enter into the missing gaps of history and the doubt of the future, and imagine how else we can be.”",'Salt Lines' is the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires. The show revisits the colonial 4000 km border of which 2500 constituted a fence of plants known as the Great Hedge of India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126206642,imgsize-269872,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-27t221614743.jpg"

""We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,” he said.Zia who was Bangladesh's first woman prime minister and also the chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, passed away on Tuesday. She was 80. She played a major role in restoring democracy after a period of tumultuous military rule and dominated the country's politics for decades.Her long political career, marked by periods in prison and house arrest, was shaped by a fierce rivalry with Hasina. She was cleared of corruption charges and permitted to travel to London for medical treatment only after Hasina’s exit from office.She was planning to contest the February parliamentary elections, which will be Bangladesh’s first polls since the popular uprising in late 2024 that removed Sheikh Hasina from power.The BNP is widely seen as a strong contender in the upcoming elections following the collapse of Sheikh Hasina’s government which had maintained close ties with New Delhi.","India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar will attend the funeral of Bangladesh's former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia in Dhaka tomorrow.

We modernised institutions, simplified governance, and strengthened the foundations for long-term inclusive growth,"" he said, citing a host of measures.Asking investors to keep trusting India and investing in its people, he said in a post on LinkedIn, that the country's youthful demography is the prime engine of ""Reform Express"", a term he first used earlier this month during Parliament's winter session to underscore his govt's commitment to fast-paced reforms across sectors.These reforms, which included opening up of nuclear sector to private players, higher education, 100% FDI in insurance sector, and introduction of four labour codes to cover a complex web of 29 laws, were designed with empathy, recognising the realities of small businesses, young professionals, farmers, workers and the middle class.""They were shaped by consultation, guided by data and anchored in India's constitutional values.They add momentum to our decade-long efforts to move away from a control-based economy to one that operates within a framework of trust, keeping the citizen at its core. These reforms are aimed towards building a prosperous and self-reliant India,"" he said. He emphasised that his govt will continue pursuing the reform agenda in the coming years.Amid opposition's determined protest against his govt's decision to bring G RAM G Act in replace UPA-era MGNREGA, he said provisions of the new law raise employment guarantee from 100 to 125 days, resulting in increased spending towards strengthening village infrastructure and livelihoods.In Parliament's monsoon session, he said five landmark maritime legislations were passed to simplify documentation, make dispute resolution easier and reduce logistics costs, replacing outdated Acts.Modi said GST slab rationalisation will ensure dispute reduction and better compliance and has boosted consumer sentiment and demand, while tax break for individuals earning upto Rs 12 lakh is an ""unparalleled relief for the middle class"". These reforms mark India's move towards a transparent, technology-driven tax administration, he said.Modi said that trade deals with New Zealand, Oman and Britain will add to investments, job creation and encourage local entrepreneurs.He said a bill introduced in Parliament will lead to establishment of a single, unified higher education regulator in 'Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan' to replace overlapping bodies (UGC, AICTE and NCTE, etc). ""Institutional autonomy will be strengthened, with innovation and research boosted,"" he said.In a boost to small and medium businesses, the definition of ""small companies"" has been expanded to include firms with turnovers up to Rs 100 crore, reducing compliance burdens and associated costs for thousands of firms. Another bill will enhance governance norms in Sebi and investor protection.","The outgoing year (2025) will be remembered for India's focus on reforms as a continuous national mission, PM Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.

'Want approachable people's courts'

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Now, lawyers can't argue for days in high-stake cases

NEW DELHI: If a citizen faces a legal emergency or is threatened with arrest by probe agencies at unearthly hours, the person will be able to seek a hearing from constitutional courts even in the dead of night for protection of fundamental rights and liberties, the Chief Justice of India said.""My endeavour is and will be to make the Supreme Court and high courts people's courts which can be approached at any time beyond working hours in legal emergencies,"" CJI Surya Kant told TOI.The CJI said one of his priorities is to set up as many constitution benches as possible to deal with pending petitions raising several important constitutional issues - like the one thrown up by a bunch of petitions challenging validity of special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, which started from Bihar and is now being carried out in a dozen states. The bench on SIR would take up the issues after conclusion of the countrywide updation of electoral rolls.CJI Kant said he would also examine the feasibility of setting up a nine-judge bench to decide many petitions that articulate the clash between religious freedom and women's rights. The issue arises in three categories of cases, including petitions seeking review of the SC order allowing women of all ages into Sabarimala temple.By custom, women of menstruating age were barred from going inside Sabarimala shrine. Another set of pleas challenge the practice of female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community and the ban on entry of women into mosques, and, the third set question denial of entry into Agiary (Zoroastrian temple) of Parsi women who marry outside the community.In another significant development, it would no longer be permissible for renowned lawyers to argue for days together in high-stake matters. CJI Surya Kant has decided to enforce strict timelines for advocates to complete arguments.""The constitutional courts will function like hospitals with emergency wards. In case of a legal emergency, a citizen, irrespective of status, can knock on the doors of Supreme Court even at midnight to seek redress of an urgent grievance and seek protection of individual rights and liberty,"" CJI Kant said.There will never be another case like the one arising from settlement dispute between Ambani brothers in which lawyers argued for 26 days in SC. ""This is to ensure that poor litigants not only get free legal assistance but also an equal share of court time during hearing of their cases,"" the CJI said.Apart from mandatory submission of written submissions not exceeding five pages at least three days prior to the hearing, SC has issued a circular saying, ""Senior advocates, arguing counsel and/or advocate-on-record, shall submit the timelines for making oral arguments in all post-notice and regular hearing matters, at least a day prior to the commencement of the hearing of the case.""To speed up hearing in pending cases, the CJI said, ""Various special categories have been identified for priority listing to send a message that Supreme Court is a people's court.""",Chief Justice of India Surya Kant wants constitutional courts to be 'people's courts' Citizens will be able to seek a hearing from constitutional courts even in the dead of night.

'BLOs Are Dying, Shut Down SIR': Manish Tewari’s Charge Triggers Showdown Over Election Reforms

NEW DELHI: With SIR again in controversy, Congress on Tuesday warned that the “hasty” electoral review would cost the democratic rights of the poor and vulnerable sections in big numbers as it accused the Election Commission of running the exercise in an adhoc manner with constant updates and new directions to BLOs.Congress spokesperson Sasikanth Senthil questioned the statement of home minister Amit Shah that SIR is being done to remove illegal immigrants, asking why is the home minister clarifying on an issue that EC should be speaking on. “Is EC operating under the home minister?” he asked.He said 97 lakh names have been left out in Tamil Nadu which does not have any “infiltrators”, and the duplicate names are generally of migrants who keep moving. He argued that SIR is like a census which seeks to create voters’ list from scratch, which is the reason it was done over two years and in a staggered manner in the past, unlike the present tight deadline of a month or two. He said weaker sections and migrants will be left out of voters’ lists in big numbers after the present SIR.Senthil said Bihar continues to have 14.5 lakh duplicate voters despite SIR, which shows the hasty and unplanned execution of the exercise.He said EC had for years been using a “de-duplication software” to identify duplicate voters, but suddenly decided to drop its use for SIR in Bihar. Referring to media reports to make the charge, Senthil said EC again made a U-turn and decided to reintroduce the software for the ongoing SIR in 12 states. He said such abrupt actions are creating doubts in the minds of people, especially when huge numbers like 97 lakh are left out of the preliminary rolls in Tamil Nadu.The MP said, “We find this whole process very fishy. EC needs to come out with proper reasoning of why this has happened.”Senthil said ground reports and experiences of elected representatives show that EC is conducting SIR in a hasty manner, without proper training to BLOs. He said while the whole process is underway, the BLO app is being updated by some new protocol every day.",Congress spokesperson Sasikanth Senthil questioned the statement of home minister Amit Shah that SIR is being done to remove illegal immigrants.

Inspection of drug manufacturing sites in India is confidential information that is exempt from public disclosure under the Right to Information according to the drug regulatory authorities. Though the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) is supposed to have started risk-based inspection of drug-making facilities since December 2022, when asked how many such inspections have been conducted each month since then the CDSCO claimed that the information was exempt under the RTI Act. However, retired and active drug controllers pointed out that there was no blanket exemption on this information.“The public has the right to seek information on how many inspections have been conducted each year along with the dates of the inspections, the name of company and the names of the drug inspectors who conducted the inspection. Drug inspectors are public functionaries paid with public money to ensure safety of drugs in public interest. Why shouldn’t this information be available in the public domain, on the website of every state drug controller?” asked Dr KV Babu, ophthalmologist and RTI activist, who sought the information.Section 8(1) (d) cited by most drug authorities to deny information “exempts information the disclosure of which would prejudice the commercial interests of a third party, unless the public interest in disclosure is served”. The law clearly states that public interest overrides commercial interests.Section 8(1) (h) exempts “information that would impede the investigation or prosecution of offenders”. “This would only apply to those inspections which resulted in cases being filed as the drug authorities can claim that revealing the inspection reports could affect the case in court. But barring those inspection reports, the details of all other inspections can be made public. However, since there is no rule mandating the disclosure, the default mode is to not reveal it,” said an assistant drug controller who did not want to be named.Section (g) protects “information that would endanger life or physical safety, or identify sources of information for law enforcement”. “How does revealing this apply to information regarding inspection of drug-making facilities? If anything, not revealing it is endangering the life of the public who consume the medicines,” said Dr Babu.CDSCO’s drug alert list released every month shows that there are companies whose products are repeatedly found to be substandard with serious failings such as the presence of bacterial endotoxins and sterility issues in Ringer Lactate intravenous fluids. The products of one such company, Paschim Banga Pharmaceuticals, killed six new mothers in Karnataka, after which it was shut down. However, the Ringer Lactate fluid produced by this company was found contaminated with bacterial endotoxins in April 2020, again in August 2023, October 2024 and in November 2024 before it was connected to the deaths in Karnataka. Samples tested in December 2024 and those tested in January and February 2025 were also found similarly contaminated. However, with no data on inspections in the public domain, there is no way of knowing if drug control authorities ever inspected this unit before the deaths occurred or when they last inspected it or what they found if they did.Similarly, samples of yet another manufacturer of Ringer Lactate fluid, Swaroop Pharmaceuticals in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh being sold in Odisha were found to be contaminated with bacterial endotoxins in July, August, September, October and December 2022. In January 2023, samples of the product lifted in Mizoram, in February in Odisha and again in December 2023 were found to be similarly contaminated. Yet there is no information in the public domain on whether inspections were conducted of the manufacturing facility of this company and what was found to be the reason for the repeated contamination. There is no information regarding any risk-based inspection of manufacturers of Ringer lactate fluid following the deaths in Karnataka.“Earlier, every unit had to be inspected once a year by state drug inspectors and every two years the licence had to be renewed after the unit was inspected to see if they are fit for renewal. This was diluted in the name of ‘ease of business’ and now inspections need to be done only once every three years. Framing of regulations ought to be patient/consumer centric and not to suit the business,” said Ravi Uday Bhaskar Director-General of All India Drug Controller Officers Confederation.Incidentally, there is no prioritization of inspection of manufacturing sites, from where drugs originate. Most of the drug regulation is in the form of lifting samples from an estimated 1.7 lakh pharmacies, stockists, distributors etc scattered across the country and getting them tested. In contrast there are less than 8,000 manufacturing units according to the 2023 report of the government’s survey of pharma clusters. According to the survey, there are 118 pharma clusters in India and 7,673 pharma manufacturing units.Though the government announced risk-based inspections, the rules do not specify any criteria, parameters or methodology to determine what constitutes a “risk-based” inspection or how manufacturers are to be categorized by risk level, making it open ended and discretionary. “This results in inconsistent interpretation across states and in practice, a reduction in inspection frequency and oversight, thereby diluting regulatory control over manufacturing compliance,” said Uday Bhaskar.RTIs queries to 16 zonal offices and the CDSCO on inspections have been stonewalled repeatedly.",The Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) is supposed to have started risk-based inspection of drug-making facilities since December 2022. When asked how many such inspections have been conducted each month since then the CDSCO claimed that the information was exempt under the RTI Act.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126253501,imgsize-777839,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Police has arrested an off-duty Air India Express pilot in connection with an alleged assault on a passenger at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport’s Terminal 1, days after the incident sparked outrage on social media and prompted a government-ordered probe.The accused, identified as Captain Virender Sejwal, was arrested following an investigation into the incident that occurred on Dec 19, when he allegedly assaulted Ankit Dewan, a passenger travelling with his family.Confirming the arrest, Additional Commissioner of Police (IGI) Vichitra Veer said, “In the process of investigation, after the registration of the case, the relevant CCTV footages had been collected and statements had been recorded. The accused was also called for questioning and his arrest was effected a few days back.”According to police, the altercation took place near the staff entry gate at Terminal 1. Dewan, who was travelling with young children and luggage, was reportedly directed by CISF personnel to use the staff entry. Captain Sejwal, who was “deadheading” to Bengaluru to operate another flight, was also using the same gate.An argument allegedly broke out when Dewan questioned crew members moving ahead in the queue.The verbal exchange escalated, and the pilot allegedly assaulted the passenger, following which CISF personnel intervened and separated the two.Dewan was asked at the airport if he wished to file a police complaint but declined in writing at that time and proceeded to his destination with his family. The pilot also continued his journey.However, after reaching his destination, Dewan shared details of the incident on social media, alleging he was physically assaulted, left bleeding, and had to seek medical attention. He also said his young daughter was traumatised by the incident.The Ministry of Civil Aviation took serious cognisance of the matter and ordered a probe, directing Air India Express to ground the pilot with immediate effect. Reports were sought from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).Air India Express, in a statement, condemned the incident and said the pilot had been removed from flying duties pending inquiry. “Appropriate disciplinary action will be initiated based on the findings of the investigation,” the airline said.Delhi Police is continuing its investigation, examining CCTV footage, witness statements, and medical records. Authorities are also looking into airport crowd management and why the situation was not defused earlier.","An off-duty Air India Express pilot has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault on a passenger.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore, approving missiles, rockets, radar systems, drones and support platforms aimed at significantly strengthening the combat capabilities of the armed forces. The approvals were granted by the defence acquisition council chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.As per a statement by the defence ministry, the DAC accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for a wide range of proposals across the Army, Navy and Air Force. The approvals cover the procurement of Loiter Munition Systems for artillery regiments, Low Level Light Weight Radars, Long Range Guided Rocket Ammunition for the Pinaka Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRLS), and the Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mk-II.Following the meeting, Rajnath Singh said the decisions reflected the government’s focus on defence preparedness. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting held today accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for various proposals of the three Services amounting to a total of about Rs 79,000 crore.”He added, “The MoD under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi is working tirelessly to strengthen India’s defence preparedness.The decisions taken today will help in enhancing operational capabilities of the Armed Forces.”The ministry said loiter munition will be used for precision strikes against tactical targets, reflecting the growing emphasis on stand-off and high-accuracy weaponry. The low level lightweight radars are designed to detect and track small-sized, low-flying unmanned aerial systems, a capability that has become increasingly critical in modern battlefields.For the Indian Navy, the DAC approved procurement of Bollard Pull (BP) tugs, High Frequency Software Defined Radios (HF SDR) Manpack, and the leasing of High Altitude Long Range (HALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The ministry said induction of BP tugs will assist naval ships and submarines in berthing, unberthing and manoeuvring in confined harbour waters.The Indian Air Force will receive approvals for the procurement of Automatic Take-off Landing Recording Systems, Astra Mk-II missiles, Full Mission Simulators and SPICE-1000 long-range guidance kits.“Induction of the automatic take-off landing recording system will fill the gaps in the aerospace safety environment by providing high definition all-weather automatic recording of landing and take-off,” the ministry said.It added that Astra Mk-II missiles, with enhanced range, will improve the ability of fighter aircraft to neutralise adversary platforms from large stand-off distances.","The Centre on Monday cleared a major tranche of defence procurements worth about Rs 79,000 crore.

'India Will Be 3rd Largest Economy': PM Modi Sounds Warning To Trump, Says World is Betting on Delhi

India Becomes Fourth Largest Economy

High Growth, Low Inflation - The Goldilocks Situation

In a major feat, India has moved past Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal GDP terms, according to the government’s year-end economic review. The economy is set to overtake Germany to become the third largest after the US and China in the coming years. A final confirmation will depend on the data released by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the first half of 2026 when the final figures for 2025 will be released.“With GDP valued at $4.18 trillion, India has surpassed Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy and is poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years with projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030,” the government release said.India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now. The size of its economy has doubled in the last ten years, and it is now eyeing the position of being the third largest in the world.A government economic note issued late Monday highlighted that India remains one of the fastest-expanding major economies globally and is well placed to maintain its growth pace.IMF forecasts for 2026 value India’s economy at $4.51 trillion, slightly above Japan’s projected $4.46 trillion.The government’s optimistic outlook comes even as the economy faces headwinds following the imposition of steep US tariffs in August linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil.Recent high-frequency data signals that economic momentum is holding firm. Inflation has stayed below the lower bound of the tolerance band, joblessness is easing, and exports are showing steady improvement, the government review noted.Financial conditions also remain supportive, marked by healthy credit expansion to businesses, while demand continues to be resilient, aided by a further pickup in urban consumption.India’s real GDP expanded by 8.2% in the second quarter of FY 2025-26, accelerating from 7.8% in the preceding quarter and 7.4% in the final quarter of FY 2024-25. This growth was driven by strong domestic demand, even as global trade and policy uncertainties persisted. Real gross value added rose 8.1%, underpinned by solid performance in the industrial and services sectors.The Reserve Bank of India raised its growth projection for FY 2025-26 to 7.3%, up from 6.8% earlier. The upward revision factors in sustained domestic demand, rationalisation of income tax and GST, softer crude prices, an early push in government capital spending, and accommodative monetary and financial conditions, all supported by contained inflation.“Ongoing reforms are likely to further enable growth prospects. The present macro-economic situation presents a rare “goldilocks period” of high growth and low inflation,” the review said.CPI inflation stood at 4.26% in January and gradually moderated over the first half of the year, before declining further to multi-year lows during the latter half. Headline inflation continued to soften and touched historic lows of around 0.25% in October. This sharper-than-expected disinflation was primarily driven by a correction in food prices.RBI has cumulatively cut the repo rate by 1.25% this year, down from 6.5% to 5.25%. The move reflected a balanced approach between supporting growth and managing inflation, aided by a favourable outlook for both headline and core inflation.India’s external position continues to display considerable strength. Supported by healthy growth in services exports and a steady rise in overseas remittances, the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 1.3% of GDP in the second quarter of FY 2025–26, down from 2.2% in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the government release said.Remittance inflows rose by 10.7% year-on-year during the quarter, reinforcing external stability. With services exports maintaining momentum and remittance flows remaining strong, the CAD is expected to stay contained through 2025–26.“India’s growth outlook remains buoyant, with global and domestic institutions upgrading their assessments on the back of strong economic fundamentals. Reflecting broad-based momentum across key sectors, the Reserve Bank of India revised its GDP growth projection for FY 2025–26 upward from 6.8% to 7.3%,” the review said.","India has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for several years now.

Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE import sand from Australia despite their endless deserts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-import-sand-from-australia-despite-their-endless-deserts/articleshow/126249828.cms,"Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE import Australian sand because desert grains are too smooth for high-strength concrete/ Image: MyBayut





Why desert sand won't do





Australia's role in supplying sand





The broader Gulf context





Vision 2030 and the need for quality





A global sand crisis





Sending coals to Newcastle is a phrase from the early 16th century, describing the pointless act of bringing coal to a city that already had plenty. As ironic as it may seem, similar paradoxes play out in the real world, sometimes on a massive scale. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for instance, are importing sand from countries such as Australia, China, and Belgium, according to the OEC. While the idea of desert nations buying sand seems puzzling, the reason lies in the specifics of construction requirements. As these countries race ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects, Saudi Arabia with its Vision 2030 developments, and the UAE with its skyline-transforming towers, the demand for a specific type of sand that deserts cannot provide has led to a steady stream of imports.This lesser-known fact sheds light on a broader global issue: the growing scarcity of construction-grade sand and the paradoxes of resource dependency even in the most unlikely places.Desert landscapes like Saudi Arabia’s might be abundant in sand, but ironically not all sand is created equal. The grains found in deserts are typically too round and smooth because they have often been eroded by wind over thousands of years.This makes them poorly suited for concrete production, where angular and coarse microscopic grains are essential to form a strong, cohesive structural mix when combined with cement and water ultimately.Concrete itself has three basic components: cement, water, and aggregate, combined in slightly different proportions depending on the intended strength and use. Cement is the powdery substance that reacts with water to form a ‘glue’, binding the mixture together. Because it is made from limestone and processed at incredibly high temperatures, cement production is highly energy-intensive and releases millions of tonnes of CO₂ each year. Some estimates suggest that the global cement industry alone may be responsible for up to 8% of the world’s CO₂ emissions , highlighting its environmental footprint.Aggregate provides concrete with its bulk. Depending on the mix, it can account for between 60 and 80% of the volume of concrete and 70-85% of its weight. Yet the term ‘aggregate’ masks the true origins of this essential material: it is made from a combination of coarse gravel and fine sediment, including sand, which can make up to 45% of the aggregate by volume. Crucially, not just any sand will do—its texture and shape are decisive factors in the strength and durability of the final concrete.The type of sand required for skyscrapers, infrastructure, and urban development usually comes from riverbeds, lakes, and seabeds, environments that produce more angular grains capable of binding effectively. Most natural sand is created through the slow, continuous process of weathering across various landscapes. A glance at satellite images shows just how abundant desert sand appears to be. Yet, despite its abundance, wind-tumbled desert grains are far too smooth and small to provide the necessary structural grip. The construction sector, therefore, relies on sand from quarries and riverbeds, where water-shaped grains are naturally angular, rough, and perfectly suited for cement to adhere.As investigative journalist Vince Beiser notes in The World in a Grain, trying to make concrete with desert sand is like “trying to build something out of a stack of marbles instead of a stack of little bricks.” The nuances of sand composition may seem trivial, but they underpin the foundations of cities and economies. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the world consumes around 50 billion tonnes of sand every year, making it the most extracted solid material globally—yet only a fraction is suitable for construction purposes.Australia has emerged as one of the key exporters of high-quality silica and construction sand. As per the OEC world, in 2023, Australia exported $273M of Sand, making it the 2nd largest exporter of Sand (out of 183) in the world with Saudi Arabia among the importers. In 2023, Saudi Arabia imported about US $140,000 worth of natural construction-grade sand from Australia.Saudi Arabia’s purchase of Australian sand, highlights the Kingdom’s reliance on these imports to meet construction standards for mega infrastructure projects. The conversation resurfaced on social media in 2024, the trend continues in the wake of Saudi Arabia's ambitious urban development plans, including NEOM, The Red Sea Project, and Qiddiya.These projects require not just vast amounts of concrete but also the highest standards in material quality, a demand that desert sand simply cannot fulfil.Saudi Arabia isn't alone in this phenomenon today. Other Gulf countries, including the UAE and Qatar, face the same paradox: vast deserts, yet a long-standing reliance on imported sand for high-quality construction. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has increasingly sourced construction-grade sand from overseas to support its rapid skyline expansion, a necessity dictated by the structural demands of complex modern engineering.Consider the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 828 metres. Its construction required immense quantities of materials: 39,000 tonnes of steel, 103,000 square metres of glass, and 330 million litres of concrete, enough to fill 132 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Desert sand, despite its abundance, was entirely unsuitable. Its grains are too small, round, and smooth to provide the fractured surfaces necessary for high-compression concrete, leading builders to import sand from Australia for the project.Sand in the UAE serves multiple roles beyond skyscrapers. It forms the basis of glass production, shapes artificial islands such as The Palm Jumeirah, and replenishes popular tourist beaches through large-scale ‘beach nourishment’ projects. According to the UN , constructing the Palm Jumeirah alone consumed 186.5 million cubic metres of marine sand, effectively exhausting local reserves.A 2024 UNEP policy brief reinforces this reality, noting that the Middle East’s rapid urbanisation is driving global demand for construction sand. While regional countries are beginning to explore more sustainable solutions, the near-term dependence on imports remains entrenched.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, a blueprint to diversify the Kingdom’s economy beyond oil is driving massive infrastructure developments. The $500 billion NEOM city, the futuristic The Line urban concept, and other mega-projects require specialised building materials that meet international standards.Thus, importing industrial-grade sand isn't just a matter of preference but a necessity. Without it, the construction of ultra-modern facilities, smart cities, and tourism hubs would face material shortages or quality compromises.The dependence on imported sand is not just a Saudi issue; it reflects a growing global concern. The UNEP has flagged that the world is facing a ""sand crisis,"" warning that unregulated sand extraction is leading to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, including riverbed erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.In response, some countries are investing in alternatives like manufactured sand (M-sand), made by crushing rocks to create suitable construction material. Additionally, recycled construction waste is being repurposed to alleviate pressure on natural sand resources.Saudi Arabia, too, is actively exploring these options. While there's no comprehensive national policy yet on reducing sand imports, experts suggest that ongoing innovation in materials science could eventually help the Kingdom lessen its reliance on foreign sand.","Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE import Australian sand because desert grains are too smooth for high-strength concrete. The type of sand required for skyscrapers, infrastructure, and urban development usually comes from riverbeds, lakes, and seabeds, environments that produce more angular grains capable of binding effectively.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126251167,imgsize-544876,width-400,resizemode-4/sand.jpg"

In 2025, Erika Hammond and Ankur Jain are one of the most followed couples in the world of business and pop culture. Both of them from outlandishly opposing worlds: professional wrestling and boutique fitness versus billion-dollar fintech renovation. The shift from WWE talent to fitness entrepreneur for Hammond, along with Jain establishing himself as a technology founder, sparked public interest in the two's careers and wallets.Interest has only intensified since their over-the-top nuptials and globetrotting antics. Although the couple is known for keeping personal finances private, various industry estimates and business valuations indicate their combined net worth comfortably nears some of the most elite high-net-worth households, with most of the wealth attributable to Jain's tech companies and much of the remainder from Hammond's fitness, branding, and creator economy income.Erika Hammond appeared on the national scene first as a performer as Veronica Lane in WWE NXT, as well as in media and announcing roles during that time. Her wrestling career, while rather short, lent her some visibility and greater name recognition, along with other contacts that would prove useful post-wrestling.Hammond moved into the emerging boutique fitness space after leaving WWE. She eventually became one of Rumble Boxing's founding trainers in New York before evolving her own fitness concepts that included boxing-inspired HIIT and strength training programs.These businesses established her as a name in the high-end fitness community, enabling her to monetize in-person sessions, video workouts, brand partnerships, and social media.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future.

Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country.

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience.

Earlier this week, gold edged higher, recovering some lost ground after falling 4.5%, which was gold's largest single-day loss since October. Increased margin requirements on Gold and Silver futures by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, one of the world’s largest trading floors for commodities, prompted widespread profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing towards the start of the current week.Despite the pullback seen with Silver losing almost 9% on Monday, Gold & Silver remained on track for their best annual performances since 1979. A combination of factors that drove safe haven flows in yellow metal included US tariff uncertainties along with heightened geopolitical tensions in the middle-east and key Asian regions were also major factors supporting gold in the initial half of 2026.Silver’s latest jump in the current month also came just two months after the London market suffered a full-blown squeeze as flows into ETFs and exports to India eroded inventories that were already critically low. London’s vaults have seen significant inflows since then, but much of the world’s available silver remains in New York as traders wait for the outcome of a US probe that could lead to tariffs or other trade restrictions.Also China coming up with a policy change announcing export curbs on processed Silver exports to be effective from the start of January kept the sentiments bullish in Silver.Gold & Silver may remain steady with limited downside seen towards the start of new-year as strong fundamentals to drive sentiments.Positive BiasBuy on Dips (Prices likely to regain momentum to retest $ 80 /Oz in spot in coming weeks)With the global Silver market projected to witness a fifth consecutive year of supply deficit with market participants estimating deficits could widen in 2026, the current deficit remains equivalent to roughly 8 - 10% of annual consumption. With China export curbs estimated to anchor an incremental loss of 400–500 tonnes for next year would increase the deficit by about 1-1.2% keeping sentiments positive for Silver towards the start of the year.However in a holiday shortened week ahead, volumes could remain low as few macro cues including FOMC meeting minutes could remain in focus this week. Hence volatility could rise towards the start of next year while its prudent to continue buying on every dips for a favourable investment into precious metals heading into next year.","Despite the pullback seen with Silver losing almost 9% on Monday, Gold & Silver remained on track for their best annual performances since 1979.

A new wage floor for emirati workers





How the new rule will be applied





Deadlines and enforcement measures





Scope of the wage increase









From January 2026, private sector employers across the UAE will need to meet a higher wage bar for emirati employees or risk having work permits blocked and Emiratisation counts affected, as the government moves to tighten enforcement around national employment and pay standards.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation has announced that the minimum wage for emirati citizens working in the private sector will increase to Dh6,000, effective January 1, 2026. The move is aimed at strengthening emiratisation outcomes and improving job stability for nationals employed outside the public sector.The announcement was made through the ministry’s digital platforms, with the update first appearing on the MoHRE smart application on December 27. The revised minimum wage will apply to all private sector services related to the issuance, renewal, or amendment of Emirati work permits.From January 1, 2026, any application for an emirati work permit that lists a salary below Dh6,000 will not be processed or issued. Employers will also be prevented from printing or submitting applications for the issuance, renewal, or amendment of citizen work permits if the registered salary does not meet the minimum threshold.MoHRE said it will send automated alert notifications through its service channels and the MoHRE smart application to inform employers of the new requirement. Employers will be prompted to adjust salaries to ensure compliance before applications can move forward.The ministry has set June 30, 2026, as the deadline for employers to correct salaries that fall below the new minimum.If an emirati employee’s salary is not updated by that date, enforcement measures will take effect from July 1, 2026. These include excluding the employee from Emiratisation quota calculations until the salary is corrected, and placing a restriction on the establishment that blocks the issuance of new work permits due to Emirati salaries being below Dh6,000.MoHRE clarified that the Dh6,000 minimum wage applies only to emirati work permits with a two-year validity, whether newly issued, renewed, or amended, and that salaries must meet the requirement from January 1, 2026.Previously, the ministry required emiratis hired from January 1, 2025, to be paid a minimum salary of Dh5,000 by the end of February 2025. Failure to meet that earlier requirement meant affected employees would not be counted toward Emiratisation targets, and establishments could face restrictions on issuing new work permits until salaries were adjusted.","The minimum wage for emirati citizens working in the private sector will increase to Dh6,000, effective January 1, 2026.

Bombay HC vacation bench directed return of original documents to two JJ hospital junior doctors without insisting on bond deposit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bombay-hc-vacation-bench-directed-return-of-original-documents-to-two-jj-hospital-junior-doctors-without-insisting-on-bond-deposit/articleshow/126264036.cms,"Bombay HC (File Photo)

MUMBAI: In a major relief to 2 young doctors who resigned from Maharashtra govt-run JJ Hospital, the Bombay High Court vacation bench on Tuesday directed the return of their original documents without insisting on withholding the Rs 20 lakh they needed to deposit. The duo, who joined JJ for MCH Neurosurgery as junior doctors between June and August, soon resigned, citing allegedly “unsanitary” living conditions at the hostel and sleep deprivation.Navi Mumbai-based Swapnil Kolape and Lucknow-based Pooja Modanwal, both 31 years old, moved the HC, aggrieved by the non-return of the original documents and being forced by the State to deposit Rs 20 lakh as a bond.On December 29, the vacation bench HC Judge, Justice Ashwin Bhobhe, heard Aditya Sanghi, senior counsel who appeared for the young doctors, and Jaymala Ostwal, Additional Govt Pleader for the State and the hospital. The State lawyer said that if the duo were agreeable to give an undertaking in the format suggested by her, the HC could consider the release of the documents, subject to the final order that may be passed in the petition.Sanghi sought time until Tuesday to tender the undertaking and said they would not claim any equities. He argued that the duo are brilliant students who were granted admission by Sir JJ Hospital as junior doctors in 2025 and were allotted a super-speciality seat in neurosurgery at Grant Medical College.However, looking at the “deplorable and most pathetic condition of hostels where in 1 single room 5 students are made to sleep and there is no privacy for females in the hostels…”, they resigned on November 17, 2025, and demanded the return of their original documents so that they could appear in NEET for other colleges to get entry, Sanghi submitted.The college cited the rules and the clause of penalty and bond for non-completion of the junior residency tenure, and for a lapse of seat or admission cancellation after the cut-off, requiring students to pay Rs 20 lakh. It said the documents would be handed back once the penalty was paid, and the deposited fees would be non-refundable too.The students said they needed the documents for the next NEET, which was on December 26-27. Dr Modanwal submitted that she cleared the entrance exam for AIIMS New Delhi and she was in merit position 20 in the general category, but she could get admission in AIIMS only if she deposited all original documents by December 31, 2025. With the relief from the Bombay HC vacation bench for immediate release of their documents, she can now secure her seat at AIIMS, her lawyer said."," Bombay High Court orders return of original documents of 2 young doctors who resigned from Maharashtra govt-run JJ Hospital.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Hyderabad 10 Minutes Delivery Strike: 'Remove 10-minute delivery option' Gig workers launch nationwide strike on New Year Eve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/remove-10-minute-delivery-option-gig-workers-launch-nationwide-strike-on-new-year-eve/articleshow/126263616.cms,"Representative Image

HYDERABAD: Gig workers unions have renewed their demand for the removal of 10-minute delivery options and the restoration of earlier payout structures, ahead of a nationwide strike scheduled on Wednesday.The Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) president, Shaik Salauddin, said the fast-delivery model was placing unsafe pressure on workers, while changes in payment systems had reduced earnings.He said thousands of workers across the country were preparing to participate in the protest, which could disrupt delivery services during peak hours.“Our demand to the platform companies was that our old payout structure be reinstated and that the 10-minute delivery option be removed from all platforms. We had called for a strike on the 25th and 31st, and on the 25th, 40 thousand workers across India came out in support of it. We are ready to discuss and talk about it. We request the state and central government also to interfere in this,” Salauddin told ANI.According to the union, the protest has already begun in phases. Salauddin said that on December 25, around 40,000 workers across India joined demonstrations, leading to delays in more than half of deliveries.“On the 25th, around 40,000 workers across India joined the protest, due to which 50 to 60 per cent of orders were delayed. What happened on December 25 was just the trailer; the real picture will be seen on December 31,” he said.The strike is being organised under the banner of the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which represents delivery workers and drivers associated with companies such as Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto and Amazon.“People can see that we have been continuously raising our demands with platform companies. We have placed five key demands before them. Our first demand is that the old payout structure should be restored. Earlier, during festivals such as Dussehra, Diwali, and Bakrid, fair payments were made. That system must be implemented again regularly,” Salauddin said.The union leader also criticised what he described as opaque, algorithm-driven management systems, alleging that workers’ incomes had suffered as a result.“The algorithm controls workers' businesses. Incentives are not being paid properly, and there is no clarity. We also want a proper grievance redressal mechanism and social security benefits,” he added.Salauddin claimed the movement had the backing of more than 1.5 lakh workers nationwide and accused aggregator companies of attempting to intimidate those participating in the protest.“Workers are being threatened. Bouncers are being deployed near warehouses, and IDs are being blocked through team leaders and area managers. This kind of pressure will not work,” he said.","The Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) president, Shaik Salauddin, said the fast-delivery model was placing unsafe pressure on workers.
