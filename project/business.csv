This year and for the past few years, due to natural calamity, our concerns have been mounting.

How can we forget the Corona period? Our country administered vaccines to crores of people the fastest of all, across the world. This is the same country where terrorists used to come and attack us. When the armed forces of the country execute surgical strike, when it does airstrike, the youth of the country are filled with pride.

We were given a huge responsibility and we introduced major reforms on the ground...I would like to assure the countrymen, our commitment to reforms is not limited to pink paper editorials. Our commitment to reforms is not for a few days of appreciation. Our reform procedure is not under any compulsions, it is with the intention of strengthening the country.

This increases the strength of the formal economy,"" said PM Modi. ""The reforms serve as a kind of blueprint for our path to growth.""He further underscored that the commitment to reforms goes beyond gaining editorial praise or small commendations, asserting that the ultimate goal is to fortify the nation.""We have brought big reforms on ground. For the poor, middle class, deprived... for the aspirations of our youth, we choose the path to bring reforms in their lives.

Goods exports decline for 1st time in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goods-exports-decline-for-1st-time-in-4-months/articleshow/112535970.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's trade deficit widened to $23.5 billion in July as exports dipped marginally to $34 billion, while imports rose 7.5% to $57.5 billion due to a sharp rise in oil shipments. The 1.4% decline in exports during July was the first since March, the sharpest since last Nov, and was driven by a fall in the export of petrol and diesel (-22%) as well as gems and jewellery (-20%).In contrast, on the import front, crude soared over 17% to $13.9 billion during the month.Gold imports fell 10.7% to $3.1 billion. ""Our exports are holding up despite what is happening globally... Monthly fluctuations in exports are largely impacted by crude oil prices,"" commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters.He argued that apart from prices, high demand for oil products in India also played a part in lower shipments from the country, while on the import side, with the Indian economy growing at over 7%, there was good demand for crude.Barthwal said that going by the current trend, the country's exports of goods and services will cross last year's level of $778 billion.The commerce secretary played down concerns over trade disruption with Bangladesh and said that the impact so far was only for a limited period. ""We are monitoring trade across the border, disruptions have largely been addressed. There should be improvement in trade and whatever best efforts are required will be taken,"" he said.While the trade deficit with China has widened, the commerce secretary said that in several segments, such as electronics, there was increase in imports of components. ""We are looking at sectors where value addition will improve. It is important to see how much value is being added here,"" he said, adding that imports were rising also because India was becoming part of the global value chain.The commerce department is also pitching for an extension of the interest equalisation scheme and RoDTEP, a duty refund scheme for exporters, and a decision will be taken soon, DGFT Santosh Sarangi told reporters.","India's trade deficit widened to $23.5 billion in July as exports dipped marginally to $34 billion.

Lakhs of people in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh braced for potential flooding after the 19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon. The dam, about 350km from Bengaluru, saw water gushing out after the gate gave way, putting downstream districts in north Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool and Nandyal on high alert.The Tungabhadra dam , inaugurated in 1953 with a maximum storage capacity of 133TMCFT (thousand million cubic feet), had 100TMCFT of water as of Saturday, with the remaining 33TMCFT being silt.Of the 33 crest gates at the dam, 22 were opened Saturday evening, releasing nearly 1 lakh cusecs of water into the river.However, the damaged gate has raised concerns, as engineers estimate that 60TMCFT of the stored water must be drained before they can replace the damaged gate. The process, along with constructing a new gate, could take up to four days or longer.Districts downstream of the dam, including those in AP, have been put on high alert. Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar visited the site to assess the situation. “On Saturday night, 40,000 cusecs of water was being released into the Tungabhadra river through 10 crest gates. At 12.50am, the 19th gate malfunctioned, causing a huge flow of water into the river. We’ve taken every possible precaution,” he said.Tungabhadra Board secretary ORK Reddy assured there was no immediate cause for concern, noting that the dam’s design allows for the release of up to 6.5 lakh cusecs of water at once, though the maximum release recorded so far was 3.6 lakh cusecs in Dec 1992.AP govt placed officials in Kurnool and Nandyal districts on alert. Kurnool city is on the banks of the Tungabhadra. CM N Chandrababu Naidu directed senior officials from the water resources department to assess the situation and dispatched a team of senior engineers to assist at the dam site.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy emphasised the need for safety upgrades to ageing structures like Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir, suggesting the installation of gates similar to those at the Narayanapura and Almatti dams.","19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon.

India's first bullet train, set to run by 2028, will pass under Thane Creek via a complex 7km undersea tunnel between Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The project involves the use of advanced tunnel boring machines due to unique geological challenges.

He stressed the need for “more people-centric engagement, a halt to border killings, conclusion of the Teesta water-sharing agreement, and steps to ensure supply of essential commodities”.The foreign affairs adviser said PM Modi extending his best wishes to Yunus had shown the way forward in terms of New Delhi’s keenness to work with Bangladesh’s interim govt and fulfil the people’s shared aspirations.Hossain said the interim govt was committed to ensuring “peaceful coexistence of multiple communities in Bangladesh, including the minorities” with zero tolerance for any violence or acts of intimidation.Hossain briefed the high commissioner on the current situation, acknowledging that the country recently experienced an uprising “led by courageous students”, which he described as a “second liberation” from “authoritarianism and repression”.","Bangladesh’s interim govt conveyed to New Delhi its objection to ex-PM Sheikh Hasina making statements from India.

However, they have also suffered from traditional prejudices. But I am glad to note that the Government has given equal importance to women’s welfare and women’s empowerment. The budget allocation for this purpose has more than tripled in the last decade,” Murmu said.She cited the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, the law that seeks to make way for reservation for women in Parliament and assemblies to assert that it is “aimed at ensuring real empowerment of women”. “Speaking of justice, let me also mention here that in adopting the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita from July this year, we have removed one more relic of the colonial era. The new code is oriented towards ensuring justice for the victims of crime instead of focusing on punishment alone. I see this change as a tribute to the freedom fighters,” she said.Speaking about the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, President Murmu while highlighting that the number of eligible voters stood at nearly 97 crore said that “this was a historic record, making it the largest electoral exercise humankind has ever witnessed”.

If someone is alive, then the soul trembles just by imagining the scene described by him, but those who took all those things on themselves may have had their hearts turned to stone.Of course, two new countries were born with the partition line drawn by the white Radcliffe, but millions of stories of the loss of Punjabis, the most hardworking and generous people in the world, have been coming out.One of them, 88-years-old Mata Gurdeep Kaur, a resident of Ferozepur city, said that even in that era of hatred and kilings, goodness was seen to win. Mata Gurdeep Kaur said that her father was Deputy Director in Horticulture Department and he was posted at Multan (a district of Pakistani Punjab). Their village Veeram was in Tehsil Kasur of District Lahore.Mata Gurdeep Kor says that before the partition of Pakistan, Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of all religions used to share each other's sorrows and joys in a very good environment, but after being provoked by some fanatics, that period of slaughter during the partition. It started which makes the soul tremble even by remembering it. He said that when they were coming towards Punjab from canal to canal on carts, the canals were full of dead bodies. The slaughter was done with such brutality that many people's legs, arms, hands, heads etc. were seen in a canal separate from the torso. She said that once the Muslim robbers stopped their caravan on the way, but in exchange for money and gold, they agreed to let go of the Hindu Sikh girls. She said with tears in her eyes that most of the people's money like gold was left behind in Pakistan, but if someone brought it, he was robbed on the way. She said that her family reached Khalra after being hungry and thirsty for three days, then went to Amritsar and got tea without milk for the first time.Mata Gurdeep Kaur said that at the time of partition in 1947, she was 11 years old and studied in the fifth standard. The Muslim principal of the school one day saw that only Hindu and Sikh girls had come to the school, not a single Muslim girl had come to the school. When he inquired about this with his staff, she found out that the Muslims had a plan to attack the school and take away the Hindu and Sikh girls. On this, the principal locked all the girls in a hall and immediately called the army. The parents of all the girls were called under the security of the soldiers.Mata Gurdeep Kaur says that on reaching in India her family was heading to Delhi on train when a Muslim TT told them that the Muslim rioters are not sparing any Hindu or Sikh. “You hide in the toilet of the train, if anyone knocks on the door, do not open the door till I call you by your name once you arrived at Delhi,” she recollect while adding that this is how a Muslim TT saved our father's life. “For us, he had become a Masiah. If people were fanatic at that time, there were also many good people who risked their lives to save Hindus and Sikhs,” she added.","Mata Gurdeep Kaur, 88, says that even in that era of hatred and kilings, goodness was seen to win.

These credits, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e), are then priced and traded. People and businesses that wish to offset their emissions can buy these credits and ‘neutralise’ their carbon footprints.“The upcoming ICM scheme should kick start with a large coverage of the country’s emissions. A single nation-wide carbon market scheme for carbon-intensive sectors should be brought in to ensure effective implementation and avoid any complexity. For this scheme to be effective, it also needs to ensure a high carbon price, data integrity and transparency,” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.Formation of the Indian Carbon Market (ICM) had first been announced under the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act of 2022. Later, CCTS was notified in July 2023 with an aim to reduce GHG emissions .Speaking about the PAT scheme , Nivit Yadav, programme director of industrial pollution at CSE, said, “The scheme was initiated with the good intention of increasing energy efficiency in industrial sectors, but faced several shortcomings in implementation. Our analysis shows it has achieved marginal emissions reduction, which is not enough as India attempts to travel towards decarbonisation, especially in the hard-to-abate industries.""",The Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE) has brought out a report assessing several emission-trading schemes.

Thanes Ring Metro to have 22 stations; tenders soon for planning particulars

The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) prepared to float tenders for hiring consultants for detailed station planning of the Ring Metro project in Thane. The project aimed to improve connectivity between densely populated areas along Ghodbunder Road and Eastern Express Highway, and serve as a feeder to MMRDA's Metro 4 and Metro 5 lines.

HYDERABAD: Shashank Manu, a researcher based out of Delhi, is out on a mission to promote urban public transportation with a twist, he's setting Guinness World Records for the fastest trips touching all stations in a Metro network.Earlier this year in January, Manu covered all stations in Hyderabad across red, blue and green lines in a record time of 2 hours and 41 minutes.He has also covered all the stations in Delhi Metro in under 15 hours in 2021.He now wants to persuade urban Indians to ditch their cars and adopt sustainable modes of travel at scale. Hyderabad metro authorities have also congratulated Manu for his feat.Talking about the inspiration behind the records, Manu said, ""I have travelled to some 70 countries so far and used metros all around the world. And I say this from my personal experience that India's metro systems are among the best in the world.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery : a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs.The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the distant past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus.Did you like this article?

NOIDA: Nalgarha resents the anonymity it finds itself in. The Hindon on one side and Yamuna on the other, it was inconspicuousness that had, however, proved an asset for a group of storied patriots who chanced upon its dense woods and swamps a hundred years ago while they organised against the British.To locals, many of whom call themselves descendants of freedom fighters who fought alongside Bhagat Singh and answered the call of Netaji's Indian National Army , it is history that fills them with pride, but also chagrin at the lack of recognition.Today's Nalgarha is ringed by luxurious highrises and bordering it is the high-speed Yamuna Expressway. Subsumed by Sector 145 in Noida, it is a far cry from the sanctuary its terrain had provided to Bhagat Singh, who was here in 1927, along with freedom fighters Phool Singh, Karnail Singh and others.Locals are unhappy over what they describe as "" neglect "" of their heroes and the lack of a memorial to mark the village's deep connection with the independence movement.People settled down here in 1955, most of them Sikhs and Gujjars, clearing out forests for a settlement of 300 families.Amarjeet Singh's is one of them.""Karnail Singh lived here all his life. If one had the opportunity to meet him, even in his eighties, one would be astounded by his physical prowess. His towering stature and strong build made him stand out among his peers,"" Amarjeet (64), a farmer, said.Amarjeet remembers how Karnail Singh used to bicycle all the way to Dadri to get newspapers after Independence.""We would ask him why he went so far to get papers. Karnail Singh would just reply, 'Dekhun toh desh kitna badal raha hai (I want to see how the country is changing)',"" Amarjeet said.Nalgarha resident Surendra Arya said he is the grandson of Phool Singh and heard stories on how the INA member sought refuge to evade arrest after some revolutionaries assassinated a British officer. ""My grandfather and others used this location as a base to strategise and plan other attacks on the British,"" Surendra said.One of the symbols, according to locals, is a large stone now preserved carefully in the local gurdwara. They believe it was used to mix explosive chemicals for crude bombs, including that for the Central Legislative Assembly bombing carried out by Bhagat Singh and others in the Delhi of 1929.Two depressions on this rock, visible even today, are results of chemicals being mixed, locals say.But in a village echoing with tales of patriotism, there were no houses waving the Indian flag, a day before the country marks its 78th Independence Day.""Today, we are able to celebrate this Independence Day because of our ancestors.

""Sadly, many will not get to know about it,"" he added.In history records too, there is little mention of Nalgarha and its role in the freedom struggle.Historian Irfan Habib said he hadn't heard the name of the village. ""But there were many secret locations that Bhagat Singh and his associates used as hideouts. There are some spots in Old Delhi too, but it's very difficult to recognise any of them now,"" he said.Another historian Aparna Vaidik said Noida wasn't then on the map as it is now. ""Maybe, the exact location was never specified then...

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Significance of the Balmoral meeting

Potential outcomes for titles

The Royal Family ’s summer retreat at Balmoral Castle has taken on a new significance as key discussions about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ’s future unfold.As the Sussexes remain distant from royal duties and make critical comments about the monarchy, their roles and titles are now in question. The annual retreat, usually a time for relaxation, is now a strategic summit aimed at charting the future of the monarchy.According to the Daily Express, a source revealed that the Royal Family’s agenda includes ""discussions about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex."" Despite their continued absence from major royal gatherings, the Sussexes are reportedly not surprised by the snub.The retreat is expected to cover not only upcoming tours and engagements but also potential changes to their royal titles.The Balmoral meeting goes beyond a traditional summer gathering. It’s a critical moment for the monarchy to address its position and future direction. “Last year focused on honoring the Queen; this year’s agenda is about how the family moves forward without the Sussexes,” the insider said. With Prince William assuming more responsibilities, including the role of Prince of Wales, any decision to alter the Sussexes' titles could complicate royal dynamics.If King Charles III decides to remove the Sussexes' Prince and Princess titles, this would be simpler than revoking their Dukedoms, which would require an Act of Parliament.
