Tejashwi Yadav Named INDIA Bloc’s CM Face; Watch Key Highlights from Mahagathbandhan Presser

NEW DELHI: Tej Pratap Yadav on Friday ruled out any possibility of returning to the Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ), saying he would “choose death over returning to that party.” The elder son of the former CMs Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi said he was guided by “principles and self-respect,” not political power.In an interview with PTI, Tej Pratap - who was expelled from the RJD by his father earlier this year - said, “I am not hungry for power. Principles and self-respect are supreme for me.”Having launched his own political outfit, the Janshakti Janta Dal (JJD), Tej Pratap is contesting from Mahua, the seat from where he made his electoral debut in 2015. “I have been attached to this constituency since much before I entered politics,” he said, adding that residents often tell him they were happy with his work as MLA.Tej Pratap dismissed the challenge from sitting RJD MLA Mukesh Raushan, a close aide of his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav , and said, “People tell me they have nobody to turn to for help now.”The former minister filed his nomination papers carrying a photograph of his late grandmother Marichiya Devi. “Of course, she was the one with whose blessings my father rose in politics,” he said. Asked if he had sought his parents’ blessings, he added, “We have not talked for some time.But I know their blessings are with me.”On Tejashwi, who has been declared the INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tej Pratap said, “It is politicians' trait to make announcements of various kinds. But power is enjoyed only by one who gets the people's blessings.”He also remarked, “Of course, as a younger brother he used to have my blessings. I could not have unleashed the Sudarshan Chakra on him.”The JJD] chief maintained his opposition to the BJP-RSS, saying, “People are not going to be deceived by the nefarious designs of the BJP-RSS combine anymore.”Asked how this election differs for him now that he is not with the RJD, Tej Pratap replied, “Nothing is different. People of Mahua are my family. I am contesting elections under my own party, the symbol of which is blackboard.”Pointing to an elderly companion during the interview, he said, “Somebody who has seen Mahatma Gandhi with his own eyes is travelling with me. What else do I need?”On Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor, Yadav said, “He is at best a trader. He does campaign work for parties by assembling resources. That's what he is doing now.”","Tej Pratap Yadav ruled out any possibility of returning to the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

Wrong. WHO has denied ever making such a recommendation and cautions against using a metric used to facilitate inter-country comparison as a benchmark for health human resource planning at the national level.The head of WHO's hea-lth workforce unit, Dr Giorgio Cometto, told TOI: ""WHO does not have a blanket recommendation of 1 doctor/1,000 population. This is a factoid that is not backed up by any WHO document or reference, but unfortunately, it is quoted quite often.""Govts have used the 1:1000 doctor-population ratio to calculate doctor shortage and to push for increasing MBBS seats in existing medical colleges and opening new colleges, even if many of these are poorly equipped.Cometto pointed out that every country ought to consider its unique epidemiology, demography, finances and health system setup in planning for the workforce it will need to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Other public health experts, too, have said the same thing while pointing to the extreme skew in distribution of doctors among states and between rural and urban areas, none of which are being addressed by blanket expansion of medical colleges.WHO uses a threshold of 4.45 doctors, nurses and midwives per 1,000 population, based on the minimum density of health workers generally associated with attaining a median level of coverage of essential SDG services. But this does not reflect the heterogeneity of countries in terms of baseline conditions and health system needs, said Cometto.Medical historian Dr Kiran Kumbhar, who had published an essay on his quest to track the root of this ""invented figure"", found that the earliest official reference was in Medical Council of India's ""Vision 2015"" report in March 2011. It doesn't cite WHO, merely says ""after detailed inputs from various working groups"", there was consensus that ""targeted doctor-population ratio would be 1:1000"".According to Kumbhar, it is the 14-member High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage for India that called 1:1000 a ""WHO norm"" in its report released in Oct 2011. it is citing data from a WHO report, which in turn is citing data from a 2004 report put together by a group of global health experts.

Pay service benefits to wife of missing govt employee: Chhattisgarh HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pay-service-benefits-to-wife-of-missing-govt-employee-chhattisgarh-hc/articleshow/124798218.cms,"Chhattisgarh HC

Raipur: Dependent wife of a missing govt employee can challenge his ex parte termination and claim service benefits of the employee who has been presumed dead after law-mandated absence of seven years, Chhattisgarh high court ruled earlier this week.With this, the court dismissed a writ petition filed by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP), upholding an order mandating the company to provide all consequential service benefits to family of the missing employee.A division bench comprising Justice Sanjay K Agrawal and Justice Radhakishan Agrawal directed BSP to expeditiously finalise the service benefits for the woman. The bench rejected SAIL's challenge against the order of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Bilaspur bench, which had set aside the employee's removal from service.The employee, a senior technician at BSP's Rajhara mines, went missing on Jan 14, 2010. His wife had lodged an FIR regarding his disappearance. Despite receiving an official intimation about his missing status, BSP proceeded to issue a charge sheet against the absent employee on Dec 11, 2010, and subsequently removed him from service through an ex parte order dated Sept 17, 2011.CAT allowed the woman's application, setting aside the removal order and directing BSP to grant all consequential benefits.SAIL/BSP challenged this order in HC, arguing that the woman lacked locus standi to file the plea without a civil court declaration presuming her husband's death.The HC bench, however, held that since the employee had not been heard from for more than seven years, presumption of death under Section 108 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872, applied. The court noted that a civil court declaration under Specific Relief Act, 1963, was unnecessary when the fact of the seven-year absence was undisputed. HC said BSP committed a legal error by terminating the employee's service despite being aware of his missing status.","Chhattisgarh high court rules that wife of missing govt employee can claim service benefits.

NEW DELHI: Anti-conversion laws framed by various states, validity of which are being examined by Supreme Court, will have to pass privacy test as the court in a recent verdict linked right to freedom of religion with right to privacy ""in the sense of non-interference from State"".While quashing multiple FIRs filed under Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had noted right to privacy & right to freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion - under Article 25 the Constitution - are interlinked and had to be examined.Referring to a nine-judge SC bench's verdict on right to privacy, it said this court underlined that Article 25 encapsulates within it the ability to choose a faith and the subsequent freedom to express or not to express such a choice.""In other words, Article 25 carries with it the facets of privacy rights, whereby a person has the intrinsic right to freedom of conscience and also the choice to express it to the world at large. This court highlighted that although Part III of the Constitution does not have a separate article declaring privacy as a fundamental right, yet the broader scheme of Part III portrays and contains in it the various aspects of privacy, Article 25 being one of them,"" it said.The court categorically noted that ""freedom of conscience as ensured under Article 25 falls within the zone of purely private thought process"". It was also emphasised that privacy is a condition precedent for the rights under Article 25 to come into being. ""This court also read privacy rights in other rights pertaining to religious belief under Articles 26 and 28, respectively,"" the bench said.It also drew a similarity on how choosing one's partner is a legitimate constitutional right in which consent of family or community or clan is not necessary once two adults agree to enter into wedlock.Referring to another SC verdict, the bench said, ""It held that the right to marry a person of one's choice is integral to Article 21 of the Constitution as an expression of one's right to life. It categorically held that the intimacies of marriage, including the choices which individuals make on whether to marry, or whom to marry, form one of the rights from a bouquet of rights of right to privacy, and most importantly, transcend the control of the State. """"The court, while observing that the Constitution guarantees the right to practice, profess and propagate religion, held that an individual's autonomy is supreme in choices of faith and belief which are intrinsic in matters of marriage. The court prohibited the State as well as the law from controlling the choice of choosing a partner or even limiting or regulating the ability to decide on such matters,"" it said.","Supreme Court quashes multiple FIRs filed under Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar Calls Out UN, Pakistan on Terror, Warns 'All Is Not Well'

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar Friday raised the issue of Pakistan 's support to the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, while highlighting the challenge that UN faces from terrorism . Speaking on United Nations Day, Jaishankar also said all was not well with the organisation as its decision-making neither reflected its membership nor addressed global priorities.Without naming Pakistan, the minister said a member of UN Security Council had openly protected the group that claimed responsibility for the April 22 attack.Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of UNSC and had worked with China to dilute council condemnation of the attack. Islamabad also managed to omit from the statement a mention of The Resistance Front, a proxy of the Pakistan-based LeT, which twice claimed responsibility for Pahalgam.Jaishankar said few examples were more telling about the challenges facing UN than its response to terrorism. ""When a sitting security council member openly protects the very organisation that claims responsibility for the barbaric terror attack such as at Pahalgam, what does it do to the credibility of multilateralism,"" asked Jaishankar.He also slammed efforts to draw an equivalence between India and Pakistan after Operation Sindoor that targeted terrorist headquarters and camps in Pakistan and PoK.""Similarly, if victims and perpetrators of terrorism are equated in the name of global strategy, how much more cynical can the world get? When self-proclaimed terrorists are shielded from the sanctioning process, what does it say for the sincerity of those involved?"" he said.The minister said UN debates had become increasingly polarised and any meaningful reform obstructed using the reform process itself. However, Jaishankar also stressed that commitment to multilateralism must remain strong as the world could not abandon hope. ""Howsoever flawed, United Nations must be supported in this time of crisis. Our faith in international cooperation must be reiterated and indeed renewed. It is in that spirit that we all meet to mark this occasion and seek to build a better world,"" he said.",S Jaishankar raises issue of Pakistan's support to the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (AoN) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (LPDs) Another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles -- with ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380-km -- for the S-400 Triumf air defence systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,imgsize-717429,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University.

59-year-old Umesh Patel, an Indian-origin Auckland man, plotted an elaborate immigration fraud scheme which was running for years, duping visa applicants. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) busted the scam and Patel pleaded guilty to 37 charges, including forgery and providing false or misleading information to an immigration officer.Patel created fake jobs to support visa applications for which he used to charge NZD $10,000 and NZD $30,000. Some of his businesses were initially legitimate, but then Patel used them to fabricate jobs and submit fraudulent documents to the government.The applicants were instructed to deposit money into company accounts under the guise of business income, which Patel then returned to them as wages, less PAYE deductions, to create the illusion of genuine employment. These falsified transactions were used to mislead INZ and support visa approvals.“This was a calculated and exploitative scheme that undermined the integrity of New Zealand’s immigration system,” said Steve Watson, General Manager of Immigration Compliance and Investigations.The INZ detailed that there was no real employment but some individuals might have performed some limited work. People even obtained residence through his scheme as they were shown on the paper as directors of the companies. But these individuals had no control over the actual businesses. “This case demonstrates that those who deliberately mislead immigration authorities and exploit the Immigration system for personal gain will be identified and held to account,"" Watson saidPatel appeared un a court for sentencing and was sentenced to nine months' home detention with 6 months’ post-detention conditions for the following charges: 21 counts of Providing False or Misleading Information to an Immigration Officer under section 342(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 2009, and 16 counts of Forgery under section 256(1) of the Crimes Act 1961.","An Indian-origin man has been sentenced in an elaborate immigration fraud in New Zealand.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities. In a report by South China Morning Post, Nicolas de Cameret, founder of BotBot Robotics, called Qwen’s models the best for such applications.Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai argued that AI success hinges on rapid adoption, not just building the most powerful models. He contrasted China’s focus on affordable, open-source AI with the U.S.’s heavy investments in trillion-parameter models, suggesting China’s approach fosters faster global uptake.To date, Alibaba has released more than 300 open-source AI models that underpin over 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem, according to data reportedly released during the company’s annual Apsara conference late last month.",Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform.

We don't do trade deals with deadlines or with a gun to our head, says Goyal





Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal Friday said govt will not rush into trade deals without protecting its interests amid assertions from officials that India and the US were ""very close"" to finalising a bilateral trade agreement that has moved in fits and starts.""We are very near as far as the deal is concerned,"" a senior official said and added that there aren't too many issues over which the two countries diverge. ""We are converging on most of the issues.""In Berlin, Goyal frowned on suggestions that India could modify its trade ties with other partners for deal's sake. Asked if India is getting a fair trade deal that's long term with strings attached, Goyal said, ""I don't think India has ever decided who its friends will be based on any consideration other than national interest... somebody tells me you can't be friends with EU, I won't accept it, or somebody tells me I can't work with Kenya, it's not acceptable. ""Goyal's remarks were seen through the prism of US's insistence that India should wind down its purchase of Russian crude.The commerce and industry minister seemed unhappy with the US's move to slap sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil and said the decision to buy a product from a country is something that the entire world will have to take a call on. ""I was reading in today's paper, Germany is asking for an exemption from US sanctions on oil... The United Kingdom already has sorted or probably got an exemption for procuring oil from the US... so then why single out India?""The minister said the talks for a free trade agreement with the European Union were progressing well.""...But we do not do (trade) deals in a hurry, and we do not do deals with deadlines or with a gun to our head,"" Goyal said.Though only a reiteration, the remarks were seen as significant because of the timing. They came amid indications that while the two sides have made progress, there was no certainty when they would reach a closure. In fact, there have been occasions when an understanding appeared to be within grasp only to slip away.India and the US had launched talks for the proposed bilateral trade deal in March but were deadlocked for several weeks after American President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on India, including 25% ""secondary tariffs"" for purchasing Russian crude. He first asked New Delhi to stop these purchases before seeking a reduction in the number of barrels being shipped into the country. On Thursday, he imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, which supply 60% of the crude coming from Russia into the country.Oil is the most contentious issue on the table with India asserting that it will decide what is in its best interest.",Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said govt will not rush into trade deals without protecting its interests.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124797873.cms,"Terror funding for attacks in India







The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","Pakistan's removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

Indian immigrants most economically beneficial







Daniel Di Martino, a researcher of the Manhattan Institute, pushed back the anti-Indian rhetoric of social media triggered by Diwali celebrations and the recent California crash caused by an Indian driver, and claimed that Indians are the best major counrty of origin group of immigrants. ""The average Indian immigrant and his or her descendants will save the federal government $1.7 million over 30 years,"" the researcher said.The research comes as the Donald Trump administration is trying to preserve jobs for Americans and exploring ways to prevent them from being filled by H-1B visa holders brought from countries like India and China for high-skill jobs, only to be assigned entry-level positions at a lower pay. The administration has imposed a $100,000 fee for sponsors who will bring H-1Bs, hoping that this exorbitant amount would arrest the inflow of foreigners in the US job market.The researcher claimed that Indian immigrants are the most economically beneficial immigrant group in the U.S., with an average Indian immigrant reducing the national debt by over $1.6 million over 30 years and increasing GDP more than immigrants from any other country.Behind Indian immigrants are the Chinese, who reduce the debt by over $800,000 over 30 years. Next, Filipinos reduce the debt by over $600,000. Colombians and Venezuelans reduce the debt by $500,000 and $400,000, respectively.The research paper also suggested granting more green cards to Indians, limiting visa issuances to people from other countries for at least 10 years so that the backlog of Indian immigrants clears up first. It said Indian immigrants now wait for decades to get a green card while in other countries, the waiting period is a maximum of two years.

'Thug' Indian Truck Driver Crash In Florida Sparks US Visa Freeze, Triggers Illegal Immigration Row

Harjinder Singh, 'no name', then Jaspreet Singh: Indian truck drivers earning a bad name in US





Why Punjabi drivers falter at US driving test









New information surfaced about 28-year-old Harjinder Singh , an Indian-origin truck driver, who caused a crash in Florida, killing three people, because he took a wrong U-turn earlier this year. Many details emerged about the illegal migrant from India and how he got his commercial driving license despite struggling to speak english, but now it has been revealed that he failed his commercial driver's license test 10 times over two months before finally receiving a license in 2023 in Washington state. Investigators with the Florida AG’s office learned Singh failed his CDL knowledge exam in Washington state 10 times between March 10, 2023, and May 5, 2023. They also learned he failed his air brakes knowledge exam twice.The company that trained Singh for his CDL claimed that he could speak English though on several occasions later it has been found out that he struggled with English.Harjinder Singh pleaded not guilty during his first hearing.Several incidents of Indian-origin truck drivers grappling with US traffic rules and causing accidents have now come to the fore.The leniency of the authorities concerned in issuing the license has also drawn scrutiny.For example, New York state issued a CDL to an Indian named Anmol, whose license had ' No Name Given ' written on it. ICE officers came across Anmol during a routine inspection and he was arrestd as ICE determined that he was staying in the US illegally.The most recent case is that of 21-year-old Jashanpreet Singh , who caused a multi-vehicle crash on a California freeway when he was driving under the influence.The CDL written exam is in English, and language barrier is one of the main reasons for Indian-origin drivers failing at driving test. Technical vocabulary like “air brake leakage rate”, “coupling system,” “pre-trip inspection terms” can be confusing if English isn’t strong. The pre-trip portion requires drivers to verbally describe every truck part and safety function — often in English — and this section alone fails many applicants.",Harjinder Singh failed CDL knowledge test 10 times in 2 months in Washington state before getting a license.

Investment linked green card: USCIS proposes lower EB-5 fees amid investor litigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/investment-linked-green-card-uscis-proposes-lower-eb-5-fees-amid-investor-litigation/articleshow/124780595.cms,"file photo

Court notice cites overcharging







In a rare move, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has proposed reducing several key EB-5 (investment linked green card ) visa filing fees, this is a significant shift, given that immigration-related charges have largely risen in recent years due to inflation, staffing costs and processing backlogs.The proposal spells good news for future investors, particularly because it follows months of ongoing litigation contending that the steep fee hikes introduced on April 1, 2024, were unlawful.Under the proposed rule, which will take several months to finalise, the fee for filing Form I-526E (initial EB-5 application), which in April 2024 was hiked by 204% to $11,160, will be reduced to $9,625. Similarly, the fee for Form I-829 (to remove conditions on permanent residency) is proposed to drop from $9,535 to $7,860.The EB-5 program allows foreign nationals to obtain a US green card by investing in job-creating projects. To qualify, investors typically invest $800,000 to $1,050,000, depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs.Most investors route their funds through regional centres (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects.Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centres rather than via direct investments.Despite the high investment threshold, the EB-5 route has attracted growing interest from H-1B workers and high-net-worth individuals in India, as it offers a comparatively shorter wait time for a green card than the decades-long employment-based queue.Once the EB-5 application is approved and the investor completes a consular interview or adjustment of status, they receive a two-year conditional green card. A second application is later filed to remove these conditions and obtain permanent residency — fees at all stages were significantly increased last year.Ishaan Khanna, president of the American Immigrant Investor Alliance and one of the plaintiffs in the earlier lawsuit, described the proposed reductions as a “commendable and long-overdue effort” to realign fees with actual processing costs.“For EB-5 investors the 15–20% lower fees are positive, but we continue to be concerned with processing delays. Even with higher fees in place until the final rule is published, the agency isn’t coming close to meeting the processing time goals Congress established in the Reform and Integrity Act (RIA),” Khanna said.Immigration attorney Matthew Galati, who represents EB-5 investors in ongoing litigation, welcomed the fee reduction but said it indirectly validates their case.“It is a pleasant surprise that USCIS is proposing lower filing fees now that the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act’s fee study is finally completed. We filed a lawsuit (still pending) stating that the 2024 fee rule was unlawful,” Galati said.With the lower-fee proposal, USCIS is effectively conceding that EB-5 applicants were overcharged for approximately 18 months, he explained. “Future applicants should be very happy with this news. But those who filed from April 2024 through today, and those still awaiting adjudications beyond the RIA’s deadlines despite a surplus of resources, will likely be quite angry,” said Galati.Following the announcement of the proposed fee cuts, attorneys for the investors filed a notice in the Colorado district court on Oct 23, arguing that the government’s move confirms their claim that EB-5 applicants have been overcharged since April 2024 in violation of federal law.The plaintiffs — led by Samantha Moody and represented by attorneys Galati, Jonathan Wasden and Jesse Bless contend that the current fee levels are “arbitrary, capricious and unlawful,” as the RIA requires fees to reflect only actual processing costs and adhere to 90–240 day timelines. Since the government plans to continue charging the existing rates until the new rule is finalised, the plaintiffs have urged the court to grant summary judgment and strike down the April 2024 fee rule.The EB-5 program is currently authorised by law, via the EB‑5 (RIA, which re-authorised the program (including the Regional Center component) through September 30, 2027. At present, it is unclear, if post this date, the Gold Card, introduced by the Trump administration will replace the EB-5 program.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has proposed reducing several key EB-5 visa filing fees.

Tomato prices in Pakistan surge over 400%: What’s driving the spike? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tomato-prices-in-pakistan-surge-over-400-whats-driving-the-spike-explained/articleshow/124776793.cms,"AI image for representational purpose

'World Has Not Forgotten': India Blasts Pakistan’s Double Game on Terror at UN, Reminds Of Pahalgam

Why tomato prices are spiking





Impact of past trade trends





Why the border is closed





What this means for Pakistanis









Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram, following the closure of border crossings with Afghanistan.The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting along their shared frontier since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.The closure of all trade and transit routes since October 11 has created severe shortages of fresh produce, grains, dairy, and other essentials. Khan Jan Alokozay, head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters, “With each passing day, both sides are losing around $1 million.”Tomatoes, a staple in Pakistani kitchens, have been particularly affected. About 500 containers of vegetables meant for export are spoiling daily due to the blockade, Alokozay said. In total, around 5,000 containers are stranded on both sides of the border, according to a Pakistani official at the Torkham crossing in northwest Pakistan. The official added that apples and grapes, largely imported from Afghanistan, are also in short supply.The disruption comes at a critical time when fresh produce from Afghanistan and northern Pakistan would normally enter local markets. The blockade has severed a trade route that contributes significantly to the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries, which includes fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat, and dairy products.The price surge in tomatoes is also partly linked to longstanding cross-border trade dynamics. According to a PTI report, in 2011, Indian traders capitalised on higher tomato prices in Pakistan, sending trucks laden with produce across the Attari-Wagah border. Truckloads of tomatoes from Delhi and Nashik entered Pakistan daily, pushing up domestic prices in Indian markets. Experts noted that floods in Sindh and other Pakistani producing regions often exacerbate local shortages, further driving up prices.Currently, Pakistani consumers are facing a similar pattern, as reduced local supply coincides with the absence of imports due to the border closure. According to R P Gupta, director of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation, key producing regions such as Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar in India usually cater to northern markets during this period. The absence of cross-border supplies intensifies the domestic price pressure in Pakistan.The recent clashes along the 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan from Afghan territory. The Taliban has denied harbouring such groups. Although a ceasefire brokered in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend has largely held, the border remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.Consumers in Pakistan are now paying significantly higher prices for basic staples. The scarcity of tomatoes, apples, and grapes is compounded by perishable stock spoilage, and there is growing concern over rising costs for other essentials. The commerce ministry has not issued a comment on the matter, leaving traders and residents to cope with soaring prices and limited availability.As the border closure continues, analysts warn that the inflationary impact on essential food items may persist, straining household budgets and local markets across Pakistan.","Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

China Breaks Silence on Border Clash, Follows India To Tell Pakistan, Afghanistan to End Crisis

What is a remote sensing satellite?

Poll Do you believe space collaborations between countries are beneficial for advancement in technology? Yes No





China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

Eurostar seeks expansion and new lines, as rivals eye use of Channel Tunnel







Eurostar announced on Tuesday that it would purchase up to 50 new two-level trains for use across its entire network of trains from major European cities like Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Cologne to London St Pancras station via the Channel Tunnel.The company said it had reached a €2 billion (roughly $2.3 billion) agreement with French manufacturer Alstom to buy the planned all-electric ""Celestia"" trains, starting in 2031.Eurostar bills the purchase as an expansion plan, saying the 30 or 50 new trains will run alongside its existing fleet of just 17 single-decker Siemens-built e320s. The new models will have 20% more seats, a lower floor and a higher ceiling than the current ones.Although double-decker trains are not used on the British rail network, save for one experimental two-tier model in service around half a century ago, the busier rail lines in the southeast of England are among the few that can in theory cater to larger, taller trains.A common sight on European rails, double-decker trains are not suited to much of the UK network, because of low bridges and rail lines too close together.The high-speed line from the Tunnel entrance in Folkestone to St Pancras in London was built to match European standards and inaugurated in 2003.Long the monopoly operator on the renowned rail line underneath the English Channel, connecting London to the continent without boats or planes, Eurostar is looking to expand its services to include cities like Geneva and Frankfurt in the coming years.Eurostar chief executive Gwendoline Cazenave told the PA news agency the company awarded the contract to Alstom as it wanted to receive ""bespoke trains as soon as possible,"" ensuring it is ""leading the race"" to meet the growing demand for international train travel.The ""milestone order"" was part of Eurostar's ""ambitious growth strategy"" to reach 30 million passengers per year, up from 19.5 million in 2024, she said. Cazenave also said the larger trains would provide extra space for bicycles and wheelchair users, as well as more legroom for passengers. Travelers will be able to choose which level they sit on, with no difference in price, the company says.Alstom chief executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge said the announcement demonstrated Eurostar's desire to ""combine technological performance, energy efficiency and passenger comfort.""Eurostar plans to renovate and expand its depot in Temple Mills in East London, to maintain and operate the new fleet from there.But the company may also be set to face competition on the world's longest underwater segment of railway for the first time.The UK rail and road regulator is expected to announce a decision in the coming weeks on which other operators should be given access to Temple Mills.Several operators, including Richard Branson's Virgin Group, state-owned railway company FS Italiane Group and Gemini Trains have expressed an interest.Eurostar is majority owned by French state railway company SNCF. The British government sold its stake in the operator to private companies in 2015.","Eurostar to buy up to 50 new two-level trains for use across its entire network of trains.

NEW DELHI: London-based academician and researcher Francesca Orsini was on Monday denied entry into India upon arrival at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here, as she “was blacklisted in March this year for having violated the conditions of her tourist visa by undertaking research during her previous visits”, according to govt sources.Orsini, Professor Emerita of Hindi and South Asian Literature at the School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics in London, is a literary historian working with Hindi and Urdu texts and has been researching into how multilingualism works within the literary cultures of South Asia. Orsini had reportedly arrived in Delhi from Hong Kong before she was deported.“She was denied entry in line with the visa rules.

UK’s F-35B Fighter Jet Takes Off from Kerala After Month-Long Stay





LONDON: In a historic reversal of colonial times, two top guns from the Indian Air Force will soon be training Royal Air Force fighter pilots in the UK.The two IAF instructors will train RAF aircrew officers who are completing flying training at No. 4 Flying Training School in RAF Valley on the island of Anglesey, off the northwest coast of Wales.A senior RAF source told TOI: “The start date remains to be confirmed; however it will not be before Oct 2026. UK familiarisation and training may take up to a year or less, depending on experience.”It is understood that their salaries will be paid by India, while the UK ministry of defence will provide accommodation.The school is where the UK’s next generation of fighter pilots get trained on the BAE Hawk TMk2. Two Hawk-qualified flying instructors from India will be based on Anglesey for up to three years. The advanced jet trainer provides the ideal lead-in trainer for pilots graduating on to frontline aircraft such as the Typhoon and F-35.The plan to bring IAF instructors to the UK is part of a new approach to building a stronger relationship with the IAF and by association supporting wider UK military and political goals, an RAF source told TOI.The agreement was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during UK PM Keir Starmer’s visit to Mumbai last week when a £350 million defence deal to send UK-manufactured lightweight multirole missiles to the Indian Army was sealed.The World Directory of Modern Military Aircraft ranks India as having the third-strongest air force in the world, after the US and Russia, and ahead of the UK which is ranked eighth.“Having FN Qualified Flying Instructors (QFIs) involved in the UK training system provides several defence engagement benefits to both the RAF and the partner nation,” the RAF source said.“The wider benefit is the building and enhancing of interoperability with a partner nation, jointly strengthening bilateral relationships through the building of trust in a core endeavour of providing world-leading flying training. The knowledge exchange that occurs from the interaction with international trainees and trainers allows for the exchange of tactics, techniques, and procedures.”","Two top guns from the Indian Air Force will soon be training Royal Air Force fighter pilots in the UK.

New research by Cambridge university to reveal how Sanskrit scholarship flourished even during colonial era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/new-research-by-cambridge-university-to-reveal-how-sanskrit-scholarship-flourished-even-during-colonial-era/articleshow/124646165.cms,"The Brahmasūtratattvārthavilāsa by Ramasubba Shastri

'There is a deep connection between Lithuanian and Sanskrit language': Ambassador Diana Mickeviciene





LONDON: Whilst most people associate Sanskrit scholarship with the Vedas, new research by Cambridge scholars plans to show that between 1650 and 1800 a golden age of Sanskrit scholarship took place even when Britain was tightening its grip on India. Yet the erotic plays and poems, legal literature, and philosophy produced are barely known about, nor have they been translated.The largely forgotten literary figures and their works are neglected treasures of India’s intellectual achievement, argues the research team, led by Dr Jonathan Duquette, scholar of South Asian religions at the University of Cambridge.“The assumption in the field was that by 1700 nothing interesting was happening in Sanskrit scholarship, but we are trying to prove that until the late 19th century, it was very vibrant, particularly in the Kaveri Delta region. For the sake of the research we had to limit our scope to those 150 years,” Duquette told TOI.Hundreds of pandits dispersed across the Indian countryside in Brahmin settlements (agrahāra) and monasteries (maṭha) kept writing poems, plays, philosophy, theology, and legal texts in Sanskrit even when Britain tightened its grip on India.In 1799, when the East India Company took control of the court of Thanjavur — the heart of Sanskrit patronage then — English-speaking schools began to spread.Gradually fewer Brahmin families aimed for their sons to become priests and instead sent them to the new, Western-influenced, schools.“This could have suffocated Sanskrit scholarship very quickly but it survived partly because of these rural settlements,” Duquette said.Awarded a five-year grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, they are leading the first extensive survey of sites in the Kaveri Delta, where the pandits were most concentrated.He and his research team, which includes Indian scholars, are particularly interested in the village of Thiruvisanallur on the banks of the river Kaveri, which Duquette has visited. This village was founded on land that had been donated by Maratha military leader Shahaji Bhonsle, father of Chhatrapati Shivaji, to a group of 45 distinguished scholars.Among them was revered Hindu saint Sridhara Venkatesa “Ayyaval”, a crucial early figure in the development of nāmasiddhānta (a spiritual doctrine that emphasises the chanting of the name of God).“For decades these scholars worked together and produced amazing Sanskrit scholarship. Some of the works have been printed in Sanskrit but most of these works exist only in a manuscript form. Some are in the Saraswathi Mahal Library in Thanjavur but are hard to access. Others are thought to be in local temple libraries, private libraries and with descendants of the pandits,” Duquette said.Most Brahmins have moved away and many buildings have been sold, but some descendants remain. “We want to understand the importance of these sites and lives, and make this common knowledge,” he said“The native tongues of these scholars was Tamil but they wrote in Sanskrit, so we are interested in the relationship between these Sanskrit works and Tamil works and Tamil institutions. We are not just translating words but will try to show that these villages were important centres of production of Sanskrit scholarship. There were literary geniuses among these men but many people in India don’t know them,” Duquette said.","Sanskrit scholarship flourished between 1650 and 1800 when Britain was tightening its grip on India.

Britain's Prince Andrew announced on Friday that he will give up the use of his title of Duke of York amidst ongoing criticism regarding his behaviour and associations with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles and second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has seen his reputation suffer in recent years, primarily due to his connections to Epstein, Reuters reported.Additionally, revelations have surfaced that one of his close business associates is suspected by the government of being a Chinese spy.In a statement, Andrew said ""the continued accusations about me"" distracted from the work of his elder brother King Charles and the wider work of the British royal family.""I will therefore no longer use the title or the honours which have been conferred upon me.

Momentum to act increased when it was revealed last week that Prince Andrew had lied about severing contact with Epstein.The duke had emailed Epstein 24 hours after a notorious photograph emerged showing him with Virginia Giuffre at Ghislaine Maxwell’s Mayfair residence, where Giuffre later alleged they engaged in sexual relations. In the email, he wrote: “I’m just as concerned for you! Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”He signed the message “HRH Duke of York KG,” with KG standing for Knight of the Order of the Garter. This email contradicted his Newsnight interview in which he stated he had cut off contact with Epstein in December 2010.Consequently, there are fears that further revelations may emerge.

Surgeons remove up to 100 magnets from teen's gut





On Sunday, when thieves climbed to a second-floor window of the Louvre, grabbed jewels of staggering worth and descended to their getaway scooters via a furniture elevator, many in France were stunned and furious. But the German company that made the elevator saw a once-in-a-lifetime marketing opportunity. Alexander Bocker, the chief executive of the German machinery company Bocker, and his wife, Julia Scharwatz, recognised their Agilo truck-lift instantly, he said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. A day after the heist, they rolled out a new advertising campaign on social media. ""When you're in a hurry, the Bocker Agilo carries your heavy treasures,"" the ad boasted under a photo of the lift parked outside the Louvre. Their speedy marketing campaign captured an internet frenzy about the heist, which took less than 10 minutes and left no injuries except French pride. The company bought the rights to the photo on Monday morning after a bit of brainstorming by Bocker, Scharwatz and their employees. ""We have even had feedback from abroad saying, 'Hey, you Germans do have a sense of humour after all,'"" Bocker said in the interview. Bocker said that they decided to make the ad only after it became clear that no one had been hurt, and they had not actively promoted the advertisement in France.A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand swallowed up to 100 high-power magnets he bought on the online shopping platform Temu, forcing surgeons to remove tissue from his intestines, doctors said on Friday.

""He disclosed ingesting approximately 80-100 5x2mm high-power (neodymium) magnets about a week prior,"" said a report by hospital doctors in the New Zealand Medical Journal. The magnets have been banned in New Zealand since Jan 2013. Doctors said the pressure of the magnets had caused necrosis - tissue death - in the boy's small bowel and caecum. Surgeons operated to remove the dead tissue and retrieve the magnets, and the child was back home after an eight-day spell in hospital.","A German company that made the elevator used it in the Louvre heist as a marketing opportunity.
