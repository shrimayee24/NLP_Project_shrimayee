"'Under the glare of cameras ... ': Kharge takes dig at Modi govt's railway minister; BJP hits back with statistics, says 'stop lecturing'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-the-glare-of-cameras-kharge-takes-dig-at-modi-govts-railway-minister-bjp-hits-back-with-statistics-says-stop-lecturing/articleshow/111089360.cms,"Kharge's 7 questions to Modi government:

Why was not even one km of ""Kavach protection"", the anti-train collision system, added after a major train accident like Balasore?

Why are 3 lakh posts empty in railways and nothing has been done to fill them up in the last 10 years?

NCRB report of 2022 states that 1 lakh people have died in train accidents between 2017 and 2021. Who is responsible for these deaths? Railway Board has admitted that lack of manpower has forced loco pilots to work long hours and this is the reason for increased train accidents. Why have the vacant posts not been filled?

Why was the Commission on Railway Safety (CRS) not empowered? The Parliamentary Standing Committee had in its 323rd report criticised the railway board for ignoring the recommendations of CRS. It was underlined that the CRS investigates only 8%-10% of accidents.

According to the CAG, 75% of funding was reduced in 'Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh' (RRSK) whereas the mandate was to provide Rs 20,000 crore every year. Why are railway officials using this fund for needless expenditure and other amenities on comfort of passengers?

Why travelling in sleeper class has become so costly? Why have the number of sleeper coaches in trains reduced? Last year 2.7 crore people had to cancel their tickets due to unavailability of seats - which was a direct consequence of Modi government's decision to reduce sleeper coaches.

Did Modi government integrate railways budget with the general Budget in 2017-2018 to escape accountability?

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Tuesday claimed that there was significant reduction in the number of train accidents in the last 10 years even as the Congress alleged neglect of safety by railways and sought resignation of Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw after the Kanchanjunga train accident which left 10 people dead and several injured.The Kanchanjunga Express was hit by a goods train at Rangapani near New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal on Monday morning. At least four rear coaches of the train were severely damaged in the collision.Senior BJP leader Amit Malviya, in a post on X, claimed that the number of train accidents under NDA rule was one-third of the accidents that happened under the Congress-led UPA. The BJP leader shared a graphic titled ""Congress should stop lecturing on rail accidents' which claimed that there were 1711 rail accidents between 2004 and 2014 when UPA was in power compared to 678 accidents from 2014 to 2024 under the BJP-ruled NDA government.Amit Malviya also compared the amount spent on railway safety in the same period by the two governments. He said UPA had spent Rs 1.64 lakh crore from 2004 to 2014 while NDA had spent Rs 8.26 lakh crore between 2014 and 2024 on safety.The BJP leader, in another post, targeted the Congress chief and listed 9 rail accidents that happened in 2013-2014 when Kharge was the railways minister in UPA government.Malviya's retort came after Kharge accused the Modi government of ""destroying""Indian Railways and posed seven questions. Kharge said Vaishnaw has no moral right to continue as a minister. ""Whenever there is a train accident, Modi government's railway minister reaches the spot under the glare of cameras and behaves as if everything is fine. Narendra Modi ji, tell us who should be held accountable, the Railway Minister or you?"" the Congress chief asked.Kharge, in his post, said ""Self-glorification will not undo the criminal negligence perpetrated by the Modi government on the Indian Railways! Accountability needs to be fixed at the top.""",The BJP claimed that there was significant reduction in the number of train accidents in the last 10 years.

'A hill palace of Rs 500 crore': TDP accuses former CM Jagan Reddy of misusing public money,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-hill-palace-of-rs-500-crore-tdp-accusses-former-cm-jagan-reddy-of-misusing-people-money/articleshow/111089643.cms,"Bathtub alone costs Rs 26 lakhs: TDP

Attempts to portray it as Jagan Reddy's house: YSRCP

Emblem of luxury rather than a conventional tourism hub

NEW DELHI: N Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) accused the ousted YS Jagan Mohan Reddy 's YSRCP government of building a hilltop palace in Vishakhapatnam , also known as Vizag, in secrecy behind large barricades.TDP claimed the luxurious property, located on Rushikonda Hill, was meant to serve as a camp office for Jagan Reddy , who had previously declared Vizag as the capital of Andhra Pradesh."" Rushikonda Palace is the most luxurious palace in the country. Jagan built this palace with Rs 500 crore people's money with whose permission? People of AP say that a deep investigation should be done on this,"" TDP wrote on X.""Rushikonda Palace incident alone is enough to know how much good people have done to the state by defeating Jagan. Look at how much effort he had to occupy a hill in Visakha and built a palace with Rs.500 crores of public money!""TDP claimed that the bathtub installed at the property alone costs Rs 26 lakhs. ""For the wife's wish, a palace worth Rs 500 crores, with a view of the beach and the sea in the north-east. The bathtub alone costs Rs.26 lakhs. Again he made jokes about the poor and beggars and deprived the poor of their homes.""""When his wife asked him to buy the Beach View Palace, he broke all the rules, wasted hundreds of crores of public money, and now come and tell stories? But what are the pictures of that bathroom, is it so big? What did you actually plan? Who did you sketch for?,"" wrote TDP.""The Italian marble and tiles used in Rushikonda Palace are mind blowing. For the cost per foot of these Italian marbles, a middle-class person can afford a small-sized apartment. This is the beach view palace built by Jagan Reddy in Rushikonda with the materials used for royal prasadas built by heads of state,"" said TDP in another tweet, sharing pictures.YSRCP leader and former minister Gudivada Amarnath said that TDP is attempting to wrongly influence the people of the state. ""We have been seeing attempts to change the people of the state since yesterday. It does not make sense to stop looking at how to use it when the Governor, President and other dignitaries come in the coming days and still portray it as YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's house.""Those in Rushikonda are government buildings, asserted YSRCP. ""They are not private property. They do not belong to anyone. These buildings were constructed keeping in mind the priority given to Visakhapatnam by the previous government. It is up to the government how to use them. People are noticing the motives behind going into such government buildings and taking pictures and trying to smear them with distortions. Even since 1995, Chandrababu has been boasting that Visakhapatnam is the financial capital. He has become the chief minister four times so far. Realize that even if a Prime Minister comes to Visakhapatnam, a President comes, a chief minister goes, or people like the Governor go, there is no proper building to host them. Going inside the buildings of Rushikonda Resorts and taking pictures and displaying bile may give you emotional satisfaction, but the people of Visakhapatnam are not doing so!""In response, TDP asked why it was kept hidden from the public if they were government buildings. ""If they are buildings built for the President and Prime Minister, why did they put barbed wire fences these days? Why did you hide it away from people? Why did you hide the courts? Why are you saying that these are tourism buildings, but now that they have been found, it is the President's building and the Prime Minister's building? If the buildings were built for the President and the Prime Minister, why did the relatives of Jagan Reddy's wife go and pray there?"" When TOI visited the facility on Sunday , the first time the site has been opened to visitors, it seemed that the design and development of the buildings appeared to align with the idea of the CM potentially staying and managing affairs from there.Early reviews suggest the seven-block structure deviates from traditional tourist accommodations. The design features architectural splendor and a level of sophistication reminiscent of a high-end corporate office or a prestigious government building.The facility, built at nearly Rs 450 crore, might not be suitable as a star hotel in its current form. Specific modifications could be required to convert it into a tourist resort or a private luxury hotel.Though the complex was developed on a 9.9-acre site on Rushikonda, it now symbolizes luxury more than a typical tourism hub. The blocks feature banquet facilities, state-of-the-art conference halls, wide corridors, and impressive lighting.Sophistication is evident with premium electrical appliances, luxurious bathroom fittings, and several automated features, some operated by biometric technology. To build this new facility, the previous government demolished the existing structure, which was in excellent condition and generating significant revenue for the government.","YSRCP leader and former minister Gudivada Amarnath said that TDP is attempting to wrongly influence the people of the state.

While initially she thought it was because of cabin pressure and that her ear would pop soon, it only became worse as time passed.By evening, she felt, she had lost hearing in her right ear completely and she could feel voices and sounds fading in her left ear too.According to sources at Lilavati Hospital, where she was admitted upon her return from Goa, Yagnik was diagnosed with sensorineural nerve hearing loss .""It has been diagnosed by my doctors as a rare sensory neural nerve hearing loss, due to a viral attack... This sudden, major setback has caught me completely unawares,"" she wrote in her post. While seeking prayers from people, she added a word of caution for fans and young colleagues about exposure to very loud music and headphones.Doctors said that sensorineural nerve hearing loss is hard to reverse. However, there are several treatment options available to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life for those with this condition. Treatment for this condition include medication, cochlear implants, hearing aids and assistive listening devices.Dr Devkumar Rengaraja, consultant-ENT, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, said that they had seen a lot of cases of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) after viral infections, especially during Covid-19 pandemic.""Other causes being head trauma, illnesses like diabetes, high blood pressure, exposure to loud noise, aging, congenital defects in the ear, etc,"" he said.Dr Vikas Agarwal, an ENT specialist, said that the condition typically affects hearing on one side and if treated promptly, recovery was possible in about one-third of the cases. ""Delaying treatment reduces the chances of recovery, especially after two weeks,"" he said.","Alka Yagnik suffered extensive hearing loss while on a personal visit to Goa.

Roads ministry eyes Cabinet nod to free up 700ha surplus land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/roads-ministry-eyes-cabinet-nod-to-free-up-700ha-surplus-land/articleshow/111094187.cms,"NEW DELHI: In its bid to free up two sets of surplus land totalling around 700 hectares , road transport ministry will soon seek cabinet approval to denotify land parcels where govt has not taken possession even after a long time since the acquisition process was initiated. In the second set, where excess land is available even after completion of highway projects , the ministry plans to use them for developing wayside amenities , including resting facilities for drivers.

Sources said the ministry is giving final touches to the policy. As per the proposed policy, after denotifying the first set of surplus land, it will allow owners to take them back. TOI has learned that the quantum of such land parcels is around 350 hectares. Officials said due to change in lane configuration or tweaking of alignment, govt ends up acquiring less land. But once govt issues a 3D notification to notify affected landowners about its intention to acquire land for a specific project, it is impossible for them to sell their land or monetise them.

The ministry will seek one-time relief for de-notification of such land parcels. Since the value of such land parcels would have gone up for their proximity to the highway network, govt expects landowners to take them back.

An 'electronic island': How Indian EVMs are different,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-electronic-island-how-indian-evms-are-different/articleshow/111093865.cms,"Built on best practices

So, why the doubts?

âCanât do anything elseâ

Multiple checks and constant vigil

Mismatch due to âHuman Errorâ

Indian EVMs are complex machines that are built to be tamper-proof , say engineers and domain experts. In fact, they pointed to added features in the M3 (model 3) EVM - more than 600 million people cast their votes on it in the recent Lok Sabha polls - that double down on its security aspects.Rajat Moona, director, IIT Gandhinagar and a member of the technical panel responsible for designing EVMs, likened the device to a simple calculator and maintained that ""no EVM can be hacked into or tampered with"". While the debate is political in nature, he said, technically, the ""Indian EVMs cannot be hacked"".The M3 model is smarter than its predecessor and has several functions that are automated, including a first-level check like what computers carry out before they boot up. ""The EVMs, if tampered with, also have a technology to return to factory setting and stop responding completely,"" explained experts. These machines are not connected to the internet nor do they have an RF (radio frequency) to respond to Bluetooth. In fact, they are not even connected to a power socket.Introduced in 2019, M3 machines will be used for several state polls and have a lifetime of 15 years before they are phased out and an updated version is launched. ""We are already exploring all the new technology that can be brought in for the M4 machines,"" said a member of the expert panel.Weeks after the 2024 LS polls, tech billionaire Elon Musk called for the junking of EVMs, saying ""the risk of being hacked by humans or AI, while small, is still too high"". Musk's post on X -- which former Union MoS IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar described as a ""huge sweeping generalisation"" - was in response to a post on EVMs in Puerto Rico.But Moona sees the current conversation around ways to gain illegal access to EVMs as being political in nature and said he'd therefore like to steer clear of it. Interestingly, to ""remain completely independent"", none of the EVM technical panel members either charge fees or accept any honorarium for designing the architecture or technology of the voting machines.According to Dinesh Sharma, emeritus professor and expert in microelectronics and solid-state electronics at the department of electrical engineering of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, ""that was the only way we knew we could remain totally and completely independent"".After every election, there are ""canards"" made against Indian EVMs and how they can be hacked. To clear the air and bust the myths, Sharma has put up a two-hour-long talk in the public domain. He also plans to release an updated video in about a month on the new machines and the security features in them to allay the fears of the general public.In his video, Sharma distinguishes between voting machines in other parts of the world and the ones used in India. ""Indian EVMs are different from other EVMs in the world. The M3 EVMs have no connection to any other device, not even main power supply. EVMs do not talk to any other device. They are only designed for voting and are not a general-purpose computing device with a loaded programme for electronic voting. So, our EVM can do nothing else. No other programme or software can be loaded on to them.""Sharma adds that in case of any issue with an EVM, the machine has to be discarded altogether. ""Each EVM is a unique electronic island in itself, and this makes them super secure,"" he says.At every step, EVMs undergo third-party review of software while mock polling is done multiple times in the presence of candidates' representatives. After these checks, the machines are sealed with ""rare"" paper from the Nashik security printing press, the same paper used to print Indian currency notes. Each time the machines are sealed or opened, it is done in the presence of election candidates or their representatives.Also, when EVMs are transported and stored before polling day, the storage room has to meet strict criteria, like having only one door. ""There is also a provision to allow candidates or their representatives to camp outside 24/7 till the polling day,"" explains Sharma.Following a Supreme Court order, tallying of ballot-slip counts of 20,625 randomly chosen VVPATs is carried out with the electronic counts of their control units for the general elections.If no mismatch between EVM and VVPAT counts is found in such a sample, then it can be said with near certainty that the sanctity of the election process is not disturbed by the use of EVMs, experts said. Till date, ballot slips of 41,629 randomly selected VVPATs have been tallied with the electronic counts of their control units and not a single case of transfer of vote meant for candidate 'A' to candidate 'B' has been detected.Differences in count, if any, have always been traceable to human error, like non-deletion of mock poll votes from the control unit or non-removal of mock poll slips from the VVPAT.","Indian EVMs are built to be tamper-proof, say engineers and domain experts. Added features in the M3 (model 3) EVM double down on its security aspects.

NEW DELHI: Delhiites have been grappling with an unrelenting and harsh summer as the scorching heat in the capital shows no signs of abating. The oppressive heatwave conditions and warm nights continue to persist in Delhi and its neighbouring areas, making it difficult for residents to find respite from the blistering temperatures.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a series of alerts for heatwaves in the region. An orange alert has been issued for Monday while yellow alerts have been issued for Tuesday and Wednesday. The city has already experienced eight consecutive days of heatwave conditions, along with three uncomfortable warm nights.A heatwave is officially declared when the maximum temperature surpasses 40 degrees Celsius and is at least 4.5 notches above the normal temperature for the area. A severe heatwave occurs when either the maximum temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius or it is 6.5 degrees or more above the normal temperature. The IMD defines a 'warm night' as a night when the maximum temperature is above normal, and the minimum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more above the normal temperature. Some parts of Delhi experienced such warm nights in the last week of May this year.According to the IMD, the high daytime temperatures in Delhi are being caused by dry and warm westerly winds blowing from Rajasthan and south Haryana. However, these warm winds are also prevalent during the night. Additionally, under the influence of a western disturbance, the city is witnessing partly cloudy skies, which prevent the night temperature from dipping significantly. The combination of warm winds and partly cloudy skies leads to warm nights.When both days and nights are warmer than usual, there is little respite from the blistering heat, either early in the day or in the evening. Meteorological officials have explained that due to warmer nights, the days become even hotter as the surface heats up more.Madhavan Rajeevan, a climate scientist and former secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, has attributed the longer spell of heatwaves to global warming, stating that it is adding to the natural variability. ""We will tend to get more frequent, longer, and stronger heatwaves. We, therefore, need to be well prepared,"" he said in an interview with TOI.The urban heat island phenomenon also plays a significant role in exacerbating the heat in Delhi. As a densely populated metropolis with a vast urban sprawl, Delhi's buildings, concrete pavements, and asphalt roads absorb and retain heat from the sun more efficiently than natural landscapes. This phenomenon can significantly increase temperatures within the city compared to surrounding rural areas, according to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).The CSE analysis highlights that heat stress is not just about rising temperatures but a deadly combination of air temperature, land surface temperature, and relative humidity that leads to acute thermal discomfort and heat stress in cities.The analysis also reveals that Delhi's extreme heat is directly linked to the increase in built-up areas. The national capital's built-up area has increased from 31.4 per cent in 2003 to 38.2 per cent in 2022. While more green cover helps lower daytime temperatures, it doesn't significantly affect nighttime temperatures. This urban expansion traps heat, making the city hotter, especially at night.Unlike coastal cities that benefit from moderating sea breezes, Delhi has a continental climate. Being landlocked and far from the sea, it experiences extremes of both hot and cold temperatures. Summers in Delhi lack the cooling influence of large water bodies, leading to significant heat buildup.The monsoon season in Delhi arrives later compared to southern India, and the pre-monsoon months (April-June) are typically very dry. The lack of rainfall reduces evaporative cooling, which is the process that helps regulate temperature and keeps things feeling cooler.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a series of alerts for heatwaves in the region.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014â15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individualâs parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries â to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The ecodesign regulations are to kick in 24 months after its publication in the official journal.The European Commission can introduce similar bans for other products in the future, an official statement said.

Thakur, who heads the secretariat at the industry body, suggested that govt should take it up as part of the bilateral talks with EU.Another industry player described it as a non-tariff barrier and said govt should flag the concern even during the free trade negotiations as these norms would negate the impact of any tariff cut that is being sought.

Here are the highlights from the speech of Elon Musk at the AGM:

The advancement of unsupervised autonomous driving technology is accelerating rapidly. Elon Musk has predicted that soon, Tesla owners will be able to connect their vehicles to a fleet and generate passive income. The market value of the autonomous car industry could potentially reach $10 trillion.

One significant revelation was the confirmation of the long-awaited Cybertruck's production timeline. Musk stated, ""We'll be in production with Cybertruck next year."" This news has been eagerly anticipated by Tesla enthusiasts and potential buyers alike.

next year."" This news has been eagerly anticipated by Tesla enthusiasts and potential buyers alike. Additionally, Tesla announced plans to expand its manufacturing capabilities with a new factory in Mexico. This facility will focus on producing the next-generation vehicle platform. Musk emphasized the importance of this platform, saying, ""Most important product development we're working on is the next-generation vehicle that will be roughly half the cost of the 3 and Y platform.""

Musk emphasized the importance of this platform, saying, ""Most important product development we're working on is the next-generation vehicle that will be roughly half the cost of the 3 and Y platform."" Musk also said that Tesla is not just a car company. He said, ""Tesla also writes a lot of software that helps what like we call the Tesla operating system internally. That is Head and Shoulder above what any other company has I think. The Tesla internal software is just way better. So...yeah it's just far more than what people normally think of as a car company.""

Musk also provided updates on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. While acknowledging the challenges and regulatory hurdles, Musk expressed confidence in Tesla's progress and potential in this area.

During the shareholder meeting, Elon Musk unveiled Tesla's ambitious plan to create humanoid robots, focusing on the Optimus project. Musk envisioned a future where these robots become essential in everyday life, extending beyond their industrial applications. Musk predicted that the ratio of humanoid robots to humans could be at least 2:1. At scale, cost of producing 1 robot could be $10k. Valuation of Optimus business could be $25 trillion. He humorously remarked, ""Who doesn't want a C3PO?"" which elicited laughter and applause from the audience. Musk emphasized, ""I think everyone in the world is going to want one, like literally everyone.""

The Optimus robot is designed to perform a wide range of tasks and has the potential to transform various industries and households. Musk highlighted Tesla's unique position to succeed in this challenging field, leveraging their expertise in electric motors, batteries, and AI. He elaborated on the company's approach, stating, ""We've had to design everything from scratchâthe motors, the gearboxes, the sensors, the power electronics.""

Musk further noted the lack of an existing supply chain for the specific components required for humanoid robots, emphasizing Tesla's innovative efforts in this domain.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk bragged about his company's internal advancements in AI, including hardware and chip design, saying he'd choose the company's in-house work over any alternative. Musk said, ""Tesla is also the leader in the real world AI so this really is a big deal. Tesla is ahead of Google... No one can, no one is even close and it's getting better I say with each passing month if not each passing week."" He said its chips are also made in-house as Nvidia and other chip players canât make a competing chip for Teslaâs use-cases (humanoid robots, intelligent cars and cameras).

NEW DELHI: Tesla 's annual meeting was held earlier this week in which the shareholders approved the ratification of Elon Musk's $56 billion performance-based stock option award , rescinded by a Delaware court for lack of board independence and transparency, and a proposal on relocating Teslaâs incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Tesla's 2024 shareholder meeting also provided several important updates and insights into the company's plans and progress. CEO Elon Musk and other executives discussed various topics, including vehicle production, new models, and technological advancements.","Tesla announced plans to expand its manufacturing capabilities with a new factory in Mexico.

""Gupta is alleged to have orchestrated a dangerous plot to murder a U.S. citizen on US soil,"" she added.According to court documents, last year, an Indian government employee (CC-1) allegedly worked together with Gupta and others in India and elsewhere to direct an assassination plot against an attorney and political activist, who is a US citizen of Indian origin, on US soil.Gupta is an Indian national who resides in India, is an associate of CC-1, and has described his involvement in international narcotics and weapons trafficking in his communications with CC-1 and others, a media release said.CC-1 is an Indian government agency employee who has variously described himself as a ""senior field officer"" with responsibilities in ""security management"" and ""intelligence"" and has referenced previously serving in India's Central Reserve Police Force and receiving ""officer training"" in ""battle craft"" and ""weapons"". CC-1 directed the assassination plot from India, it added.Federal prosecutors alleged that CC-1 recruited Gupta in May 2023 to orchestrate the assassination in the US.Pannun is a vocal critic of the Indian government and leads a US-based organisation that advocates for the secession of Punjab, the federal prosecutors said.They alleged that on CC-1's direction, Gupta contacted an individual whom he believed to be a criminal associate but he was in fact a confidential source working with the DEA (the CS) for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder the victim in New York City.""The CS introduced Gupta to a purported hitman, who was in fact a DEA undercover officer (the UC). CC-1 subsequently agreed, in dealings brokered by Gupta, to pay the UC USD 1,00,000 to murder the victim. On or about June 9, 2023, CC-1 and Gupta arranged for an associate to deliver USD 15,000 in cash to the UC as an advance payment for the murder. CC-1's associate then delivered the USD 15,000 to the UC in Manhattan,"" they said.In June 2023, in furtherance of the assassination plot, CC-1 provided Gupta with personal information about the victim, including the victim's home address, phone numbers associated with the victim and details about the victim's day-to-day conduct, which Gupta then passed on to the UC, they added.CC-1 directed Gupta to provide regular updates on the progress of the assassination plot, which Gupta accomplished by allegedly forwarding to CC-1, among other things, surveillance photographs of the victim.""Gupta directed the UC to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but Gupta also specifically instructed the UC not to commit the murder around the time of anticipated engagements scheduled to occur in the ensuing weeks between high-level US and Indian government officials,"" the prosecutors said.According to the prosecutors, after Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed outside a gurdwara in Canada on June 18, 2023, Gupta allegedly told the UC that he ""was also the target"" and ""we have so many targets"".Around June 20, 2023, CC-1 sent Gupta a news article about the victim and messaged him ""(i)t's (a) priority now"", the prosecutors alleged.","Nikhil Gupta is accused of being involved in a murder-for-hire plot against a Sikh extremist in New York. Gupta, 53, was arrested and detained in the Czech Republic on June 30, 2023, at the request of the US government. He was extradited to the US on June 14 and pleaded not guilty.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111093925,imgsize-1061751,width-400,resizemode-4/111093925.jpg"
What's a heat dome? Here's why so much of the US is broiling this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-a-heat-dome-heres-why-so-much-of-the-us-is-broiling-this-week/articleshow/111093905.cms,"A heat dome and a heat wave are two related but distinct weather phenomena that are causing extreme summer temperatures across much of the Midwest and Northeast of USA this week. While both terms indicate very hot conditions, they differ in their specific characteristics and impacts.A heat dome refers to the atmospheric conditions that lead to high temperatures . It occurs when a high-pressure system develops in the upper atmosphere, causing the air below to sink and compress. This compression raises temperatures in the lower atmosphere, creating a dome-like structure of hot air. The boundaries of the current heat dome are not precisely defined, but the National Weather Service expects the most extreme heat in the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.On the other hand, a heat wave is defined by the intensity, duration, and location of the heat experienced by people on the ground. The severity of a heat wave depends on the region; for example, several days of temperatures above 90Â°F (32Â°C) might be considered a heat wave in the Midwest and Northeast, while such temperatures are more common in Texas. This week, the Midwest and Northeast are expected to experience mid- to high-90s temperatures, with heat indices reaching or exceeding 100Â°F (38Â°C). These conditions can be particularly challenging for populations not accustomed to such extreme heat.The combination of clear skies and the higher summertime angle of the sun can result in high heat index readings, which measure the combined effect of temperature and humidity. Humidity makes the weather feel hotter because it hinders the body's ability to cool itself through sweating. Several cities, including Detroit, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Albany, are expected to break temperature records and experience heat indices near or above 100Â°F (38Â°C) this week.The United States experienced the most heat waves since 1936 last year, contributing to more than 2,300 deaths, the highest number in 45 years of records. The current heat dome is expected to affect a broad area from the Great Plains states up through Maine, with some locations potentially seeing their hottest temperatures on record for any month. As of Tuesday, nearly 77 million people in the United States were under extreme heat alerts.","A heat dome occurs when a high-pressure system develops in the upper atmosphere, causing the air below to sink and compress.
