"Electoral bonds scrapped by SC, trusts now swell BJP coffers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/electoral-bonds-scrapped-by-sc-trusts-now-swell-bjp-coffers/articleshow/126108961.cms,"Vaping, Bhow-Bhow & Shouting Match: A Look At Viral Moments Of Parl As Chaotic Winter Session Ends

NEW DELHI: Rather than having an adverse impact on BJP's coffers, scrapping of electoral bonds in Feb 2024 ended up boosting its donations kitty in 2024-25, with electoral trusts alone disbursing over Rs 3,577 crore to the party.In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts. With electoral bonds scrapped, corporate donors still seeking partial anonymity - as regards party-wise break-up of their contributions - appear to have settled for the electoral trust (ET) route while retaining BJP as the top beneficiary.The party in office at the Centre cornered 83.6% of the nearly Rs 4,276 crore contributions routed through electorate trusts, according to data on the EC website. Compared to 2023-24, this marks an over four-fold rise in corporate donations to BJP through this route. Congress accounted for 7.3% and Trinamool Congress for 3.6% of contributions made through the ET route.The donations via electoral trusts are only a part of total contributions received by parties. The other sources include individuals, corporates, institutions and welfare bodies donating directly. Over the past years, the volume of non-trust donations has consistently exceeded that from contributions via trusts.Of the Rs 3,577.5 crore contribution receipts of BJP in 2024-25 though trusts, Rs 2,180.7 crore was disbursed by Prudent Electoral Trust (ET), Rs 757.6 crore by Progressive ET, Rs 460 crore by A B General ET, Rs 150 crore by New Democratic ET, Rs 30.1 crore by Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore by Triumph ET, Rs 5 crore by Jaybharath ET, Rs 3 crore by Samaj ET, Rs 9.5 lakh by Jankalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh by Einzigartig ET.Congress received Rs 216.3 crore from Prudent in 2024-25, Rs 77.3 crore from Progressive, Rs 15 crore from AB General ET, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 via the trust route.Prudent maintained its position as the top trust donor to political parties, having disbursed a total of Rs 2,668 crore to 15 parties in the last financial year. The Tata Group-linked Progressive ET was a distant second with its total contributions at Rs 915 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 757 crore went to BJP, Rs 77 crore to Congress and Rs 10 crore to eight other parties.Prudent's Rs 2,668 crore kitty was distributed among BJP (Rs 2,180.7 crore); Congress (Rs 216.3 crore); Trinamool Congress (Rs 92 crore); YSR Congress Party (Rs 88 crore); TDP (Rs 40 crore); AAP (Rs 16.4 crore); Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (Rs 10 crore); BRS, JDU, BJD and AJSU (Rs 5 crore each); Sikkim Democratic Front (Rs 2.5 crore); LJP and NCP (Rs 1 crore each); and Praja Shanthi Party (Rs 50 lakh).A B General ET made Rs 460 crore worth of corporate donations to BJP and Rs 15 crore to Congress. The Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore contributions to BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each. Triumph disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati Electoral Trust disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.Congress's receipts in 2024-25 fell way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24 but were higher than its Rs 171 crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC's Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, were no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore receipts in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but also its receipts from trusts, which dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.","In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts.

Experts on Aravalli

The road ahead

If demography can be a dividend, geography certainly decides its destiny. Few landscapes illustrate this more clearly than the Aravalli Range, an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India.The hills that run for nearly 690 km from Gujarat through Rajasthan and Haryana to Delhi, forming the oldest fold mountain system in the subcontinent, have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate.At the heart of the issue is a simple but emotive question. What exactly counts as the Aravalli range? The answer matters because this classification determines which areas can be mined, built upon, or conserved.A recent ruling by the Supreme Court has accepted a ""standard definition"" proposed by the central government to identify what qualifies as the Aravalli Hills. While the move was intended to bring clarity to long-standing disputes, the definition’s limited ecological lens has raised fresh concerns about environmental protection and sustainable development.In November, the Supreme Court agreed with a proposal by the central government on how the Aravalli hills should be officially identified.The court said that only those hills that rise at least 100 metres above the surrounding land, or groups of such hills located close to each other, will be considered part of the Aravalli range for regulatory purposes.The court also asked the Union government to carefully map the region and prepare a clear plan for managing it. This plan will include rules on where mining can take place and how it should be regulated. The aim is to remove confusion caused by different government records and maps, which have often led to disputes and court cases in the past.Environmental experts maintain the significance of the Aravalli hills is not about how tall they are, but about what they do.The hills work like a natural water storage system, with their rocky structure allowing rainwater to slowly seep underground and refill aquifers. These aquifers supply water to many towns in Rajasthan and big cities such as Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, and Alwar. Studies even show that large-scale mining and cutting of hills damage this process, leading to long-term loss of groundwater.The Aravallis also help slow the spread of the Thar Desert towards eastern India. Scientists warn that if the hills continue to be damaged, desertification could increase, along with dust storms and extreme heat in the Indo-Gangetic plains.Although the region is dry, the Aravalli hills support forests, scrubland and grasslands. These habitats are home to wildlife such as leopards, hyenas, nilgai and many bird species. Conservationists say these ecosystems are fragile and can be easily broken apart by mining and construction.The current controversy is primarily rooted in decades of judicial scrutiny. Since the 1980s, courts have intervened repeatedly to curb unregulated mining in the Aravalli belt, particularly in Rajasthan and Haryana.Multiple Supreme Court orders in the 1990s and early 2000s restricted mining in notified forest areas, citing environmental degradation, air pollution and public health risks. However, enforcement remained weak due to the absence of a universally accepted definition of what constituted the Aravalli range.Mining operators and developers often argued that certain hillocks or plateaus did not legally qualify as Aravallis, even if they were ecologically linked to the system. This ambiguity reportedly created administrative paralysis and prolonged litigation, prompting the Centre to seek a standardised definition.Government officials and legal experts defending the Supreme Court’s ruling argue that the elevation-based criterion introduces clarity into a highly subjective domain. They say that by setting a measurable threshold, authorities can avoid arbitrary decisions and reduce disputes over land classification.In its observation, the top court acknowledged the need to balance environmental protection with economic realities. Mining of stone and minerals in the Aravalli region supports livelihoods and supplies essential materials for construction and infrastructure. A blanket ban, the SC noted, could have severe economic consequences if not backed by clear scientific and legal parameters.The ruling has drawn criticism from ecologists, hydrologists, and civil society groups who believe that the 100-meter threshold oversimplifies a complex landscape like the Aravalli.They point out that many ecologically critical features of the Aravalli system, including recharge zones, wildlife corridors and low-lying ridges, do not meet the elevation criterion but are vital to the range’s environmental function. Excluding these areas from automatic protection, critics say, could open the door to expanded mining and construction.Experts also warn that mining impacts are cumulative, as even shallow or small-scale extraction can permanently alter drainage patterns and soil stability, consequently reducing the land’s ability to absorb rainfall. In arid and semi-arid regions, such damage is often irreversible.Once this order is implemented in full force, which is for mining purposes, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said, ""tomorrow it could be real estate or other things that could begin in the region, which is also the main fear of the locals of the entire region.""Disagreeing with the new definition of Aravalli, Jha said, ""the mountain is not just a piece of rock assembled together. Aravalli, which is the oldest mountain range in the world, is also an ecosystem."" He said, ""If mining is allowed...Aravalli, which is above the ground, is also under the ground. So it's not just the tree cover, green cover, or the national dust shield or weather shield it provides, but at the end of the day, temperature and air quality between Thar and Delhi are maintained because of the shield of the Aravalli. ""Shedding light on the risk arising from the new definition that ""lifts the protection,"" he said, risk is that all of this will be a large-scale plundering of this area and not just by mining, but also by other areas like real estate.""Once we start calling it a forest and not a range, and it falls under a semi-urban landscape or rural landscape rather than a protected landscape, it will be open for any kind of exploitation through economic-commercial activity,"" he told TOI.Talking about the impact on the Delhi-NCR region, which witnesses toxic-air-driven health hazards every year, Jha said, ""Firstly, desertification increases when we compromise with the buffer we have. Secondly, when the dust increases, the PM10 level we have in the Delhi-NCR is pathetic and therefore the risk or the intensity of air quality increases. Aravalli's entire area is also the main water recharge table, so the water sufficiency of the region is also questioned because of mining. ""Magasaysay awardee Rajendra Singh, known as the ""Waterman of India,"" said earlier governments and courts took nature and environmental issues seriously, but that approach has disappeared.""If this decision, meant to benefit one individual, is implemented, only 7-8 per cent of the Aravalli will survive,"" he told news agency PTI, calling for a legal battle as well as mass public mobilisation.The Supreme Court’s directive to conduct scientific mapping is now seen as the critical next step. Environmental lawyers say the outcome will depend on how comprehensively the mapping exercise incorporates hydrology, biodiversity and geomorphology, rather than focusing solely on elevation. Transparency will also be key.Civil society groups have demanded that maps and management plans be made public and subjected to independent scientific review. Without such safeguards, they argue, the process risks becoming a procedural formality rather than a tool for genuine conservation.At its core, the Aravalli debate reflects a broader challenge in India’s environmental governance. How to reconcile development pressures with the protection of natural systems that do not conform neatly to administrative boundaries or numerical thresholds.As climate stress intensifies and water scarcity deepens across north-west India, the fate of the Aravalli range carries implications far beyond the hills themselves. Whether the Supreme Court’s attempt at regulatory clarity strengthens or weakens environmental protection will depend on how the ruling is implemented on the ground, which ultimately remains at the mercy of bureaucracy.For now, India’s oldest mountain range stands at a crossroads, its fate being debated and defined by modern institutions that are only a moment in time compared to the ancient geology they now seek to regulate.","The Aravalli Range is an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India. The hills that run for nearly 690 km from Gujarat through Rajasthan and Haryana to Delhi have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate.

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns expressed in certain quarters over the possibility of expansion of mining activities in the Aravali Hills and Ranges in the wake of its new uniform definition, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was absolutely wrong to conclude that the mining is permitted in all landforms below 100 metres height as there has been no relaxation made at all in the Aravali.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravali can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravali is protected and secure,” he posted on X.The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat. Only a very small area is under permitted mining leases and out of this small percentage, nearly 90 % of the mining activity is confined to Rajasthan, followed by about 9% in Gujarat and about 1% in Haryana. No mining activity is permitted in Delhi.Yaav said the Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metre of two adjoining hills of height of 100 metres or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease, said the minister.He also clarified the issue in detail in response to a media query on the sidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s meeting at Unesco World Heritage Site Sundarbans.The question pertained to the recent Supreme Court's acceptance of uniform policy level definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges specifically in the context of regulating mining.Yadav, however, emphasised that all the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease.The Opposition parties had raised the issue in the Parliament during the concluded winter session, claiming that the definition would exclude most of the Aravali range from protection. In the wake of the SC's Nov order of accepting the Centre-backed definition, Congress general secretary and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh called the move a severe blow to the Aravali ecosystem.""The Aravalli Hills extend from Delhi through Haryana and Rajasthan to Gujarat. Over the years they have been devastated by mining, construction, and other activities in violation of all regulations and laws. Now it appears that this sensitive and sprawling ecosystem will be subject to another severe blow,"" Ramesh had posted on X.Referring to media reports, he had said, ""This definition is meant to restrict mining but in reality will mean that 90% of the Aravalli Hills will not be counted as Aravalli any more. Evidently, the Supreme Court has accepted this revised definition. This is bizarre and will have very grave environmental and public health consequences. It calls for an immediate review.""Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too opened a front against the SC recent move, blaming the Centre for pitching for that uniform definition. Yadav on Sunday, however, appealed to everyone to ""stop spreading confusion"" and even explained how the Rajasthan government has been following the definition since 2006.His ministry also explained that all Aravali range states/UT during deliberations agreed to adopt the uniform criterion of “100 metres above local relief” for regulating mining in the Aravalli region as had been in force in Rajasthan while unanimously agreeing to make it more objective and transparent.""All the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease. Similarly, Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metres of two adjoining Hills of height 100 metre or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease,"" the ministry clarified.By defining Aravalli Hills as any landform rising 100 metres or more above local relief, along with their supporting slopes, the entire ecological unit is protected. This prevents piecemeal exploitation of slopes or foothills that are vital for soil stability, water recharge, and vegetation cover.""","The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat. Only a very small area is under permitted mining leases and out of this small percentage, nearly 90 % of the mining activity is confined to Rajasthin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126106665,imgsize-1036421,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-62.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Train passengers travelling in AC coaches and non-AC passengers on Mail and Express trains will have to pay slightly more from December 26, as the Railway Ministry has increased fares by 2 paise per kilometre for these categories. A passenger travelling 500 km in a non-AC coach will have to pay Rs 10 extra.This is the second fare revision by Indian Railways during the current financial year. The previous fare revision was implemented in July.Under the current fare rationalisation, there will be no increase in fares for suburban services and Monthly Season Tickets (MSTs), which account for the largest share of railway passengers. In addition, ordinary class passengers travelling up to 215 km will not face any fare hike, a move aimed at protecting short-distance and economically weaker travellers, railway ministry sources said.For journeys beyond 215 km in ordinary class, fares will increase by 1 paise per kilometre. In Mail and Express non-AC classes, the fare hike is 2 paise per kilometre, while AC classes will also see a modest increase of 2 paise per kilometre.Indian Railways expects to earn approximately Rs 600 crore during the current year as a result of this fare rationalisation.Officials said that over the last decade, Indian Railways has significantly expanded its network and operations. With more train services, higher speeds, and a strong focus on safety, manpower requirements have increased substantially. As a result, manpower costs have risen to Rs 1.15 lakh crore, while pension liabilities have increased to Rs 60,000 crore. For the 2024–25 financial year, the total cost of operations has reached Rs 2.63 lakh crore.To manage these rising costs, officials said Railways is focusing on higher cargo loading along with limited passenger fare rationalisation.",Passengers travelling in AC coaches and non-AC passengers on Mail and Express trains will have to pay slightly more from December 26.

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Sunday said the arrest of a serving army officer in an alleged bribery case reflects the government’s “zero tolerance” approach to corruption.“The present action has been taken in line with the Government of India’s stated policy of ‘Zero Tolerance Against Corruption.’ The arrest demonstrates the government’s proactive approach to curbing corruption through legal and institutional mechanisms,” a senior defence ministry official told news agency ANI.The statement came a day after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Lieutenant Colonel Deepak Kumar Sharma and Vinod Kumar, a private individual and the alleged middleman, in connection with the case linked to defence-related clearances and favours.The premier investigative agency alleged that the duo acted as “conduits” for the delivery of bribes.Lt Col Sharma, who was serving as deputy planning officer in the Department of Defence Production under the Ministry of Defence, has been accused of “habitually engaging” in corrupt practices, including accepting bribes from private defence firms in return for undue favours.According to the CBI, the officer was in contact with a Dubai-based defence company through its representatives, Rajiv Yadav and Ravjit Singh, who are reportedly based in Bengaluru and managed the firm’s Indian operations.Investigators allege that Yadav and Singh were in regular touch with Sharma and coordinated with him to secure favourable outcomes for the company through illegal means.The case also names Lt Col Sharma’s wife, who is also a serving army officer. Colonel Kajal Bali is currently posted as the commanding officer of the 16 Infantry Division Ordnance Unit in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The FIR further mentions several unidentified individuals and a Dubai-based company.As per the CBI, on December 18, Kumar allegedly delivered a bribe of Rs 3 lakh to Sharma on behalf of the company.During searches conducted at multiple locations, the agency seized large sums of cash. A search of Lt Col Sharma’s residence in Delhi led to the recovery of Rs 2.23 crore in cash, while Rs 10 lakh was seized from the residence of Colonel Bali.The CBI carried out searches across several locations in Delhi, Sri Ganganagar, Bengaluru and Jammu as part of the probe.The officer and the alleged middleman were produced before a court on Saturday and remanded to police custody until December 23.The CBI said further investigation into the case is underway and additional aspects are being examined.","Defence ministry says arrest of army officer reflects government's 'zero tolerance' approach to corruption.

NEW DELHI: The higher reaches of Kashmir witnessed fresh snowfall while the plains received rain on Sunday, bringing relief to residents as Chillai-Kalan, the Valley’s harshest 40-day winter period, set in after a prolonged dry spell, as per PTI.Officials said snowfall was reported from the Gulmarg tourist resort in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district, where around two inches of snow had accumulated.In Sonamarg, located on the Srinagar–Kargil highway, snowfall began early Sunday morning and continued till the last reports were received.Sadhna Top, the mountain pass connecting the Tangdhar sector along the Line of Control with the rest of the Kashmir Valley, recorded moderate snowfall, with about six inches accumulating since Saturday night.Light rainfall was also reported overnight in Srinagar and other parts of the Valley and continued intermittently through Sunday, officials said.The weather department has forecast an increase in snowfall and rain across Kashmir over the next 48 hours.The precipitation has brought much-needed relief after an extended dry spell that had led to a rise in common ailments such as cough and cold, particularly among children and the elderly.The rain and snow on the first day of Chillai-Kalan are traditionally considered a good omen by locals and seen as a sign of ample snowfall in the coming weeks.Authorities said preparations were in place to deal with heavy snowfall, with arrangements reviewed for roads, power and water supply, health services and essential commodities.""I took a review of both divisions, especially areas where it is expected to snow, all districts in the Valley and the higher reaches of Jammu. The administration has finalised all preparations, but, whether that would suffice, will only be known after tomorrow when it starts to snow,"" CM Omar Abdullah said on Saturday.Despite possible hardships, the snowfall is expected to improve air quality and give a boost to winter tourism, which had suffered last year due to a largely dry winter.""Even if we face some hardships due to the snow, I do not think anyone should complain because we have been eagerly awaiting snowfall. It will clear the air, mitigate pollution, and kick off the winter tourism season,"" he added.Chillai-Kalan, also known as the “big cold”, will continue until January 30, after which the Valley will enter the milder Chillai-Khurd and Chillai-Bacha phases.","The higher reaches of Kashmir witnessed fresh snowfall while the plains received rain on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: The external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change,” suggesting that India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.Addressing the convocation of an institute in Pune, Jaishankar said the cumulative impact of recent global developments has altered the international pecking order.“The cumulative result of all these happenings is that the global economic and, thereafter, political pecking order has actually undergone a very significant change,” he said, according to ANI.Pointing towards the shifts in the international labour market, the minister said India is increasingly becoming a driver of the global workforce.“We have started to surge in trained human resources at the very time when many developed nations are struggling to find them,” he said, adding, “Since demand and supply invariably develop their own equation, we have entered an era of mobility.”The minister also mentioned that this growing cross-border mobility now places new responsibilities on governments. “We need to ensure welfare, including in conflict situations, and the politics of this mobility needs to be managed,” he said, referring to India’s efforts to protect its citizens abroad.Reflecting on the post-colonial global order, Jaishankar said control over national destinies has shifted back to sovereign states, making policy choices a decisive factor. He noted that while China has “gained the most” since decolonisation, India has “done well, especially in the post-reform era,” and even more so over the past decade.In contrast, he criticised the Western economic model, linking current discontent to past decisions.“Western elites consciously chose to shift production to maximise profits. Their competitiveness has eroded over the years, accelerated by their lifestyle,” he said. “Much of the Western world now feels that they have stagnated, a sentiment that has increasingly come to acquire a political meaning.”Concluding his address, Jaishankar told students that national progress is shaped by leadership and governance. In India’s case, he said, “leadership and governance have led to ups and downs in various phases in our economic growth and in our social transformation,” urging them to see themselves as contributors to a “Viksit Bharat” that is increasingly shaping, not just participating in, the global order.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a ‘very significant change’ He said India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092509,imgsize-487596,width-400,resizemode-4/s-jaishankar-file-photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday gave her assent to the Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, 2025 - which replaces the UPA-era MGNREGA and was passed by Parliament amid protests by opposition - marking a significant shift in the rural employment policy framework.With the presidential assent, it now becomes the VB-G RAM G Act, 2025, and a notification in this regard was published in the Gazette of India on Dec 21. The notification states that the new law seeks to ""establish a rural development framework aligned with the national vision of Vikshit Bharat@2047"" by providing a statutory guarantee of not less than 125 days of wage employment per rural household in each financial year to households whose adult members volunteer to undertake unskilled manual work.The rural development ministry said, ""This enhancement over the earlier 100-day entitlement (under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005) strengthens livelihood security, predictability of work, and income stability for rural households."" Meanwhile, amid mounting attack from opposition parties demanding withdrawal of the bill, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday in a video message said, ""Once again, a conspiracy is underway to mislead the country in the name of MGNREGA"" and added that the VB-G RAM G scheme is in favour of the poor and it provides a complete guarantee of employment to workers"".""Misinformation is being spread, whereas the truth is that the new scheme is beyond MGNREGA,"" he said on X. ""For this scheme, a massive amount of over Rs 1,51, 282 crore has been proposed this year itself, so that there is sufficient money to provide employment..."" he added.He highlighted the provision wherein administrative expenses have been increased from 6% to 9%. ""If we take out 9% from the proposed amount of Rs 1.51 lakh crore, it comes to Rs 13,000 crore; with this amount, all those who get the work done will receive timely and adequate salaries, so that they can carry out the work with full capacity,"" he said.","President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday gave her assent to the Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, 2025.

Camera data was reviewed twice daily by field teams, enabling officers to identify a safe capture window.Saturday, teams moved into position to minimise disturbance. ""Margin for error in such operations is extremely small. Every step, from tracking to flight, was planned in advance,"" an officer involved in the operation said.Wildlife veterinarians tranquillised the tigress strictly as per protocol, while ground staff secured the area to ensure there was no civilian movement. Veterinarians conducted a health examination before placing the animal in a specially-designed transport crate with proper ventilation and monitoring access.Her vitals were monitored as the crate was moved to a designated helipad inside the reserve.An Mi-17 helicopter landed at first light, and loading was completed swiftly to limit ground time. Senior veterinarians and forest officers from MP and Rajasthan accompanied the tigress onboard, monitoring her condition throughout the flight.Officials said airlifting was preferred over road transport to sharply reduce travel time and stress on the animal, and to avoid moving through forest corridors and human-dominated landscapes.The operation is being seen as a template for future inter-state tiger translocations approved by NTCA, which has approved translocation of 15 tigers from MP to Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Odisha as part of a broader conservation push.",Three-year-old tigress airlifted from Madhya Pradesh to Rajasthan on an IAF helicopter.

No 'sovereign immunity' for negligent Army drivers: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-sovereign-immunity-for-negligent-army-drivers-hc/articleshow/126109447.cms,"5 injured in 1996 accident

CHANDIGARH: In an order having wide-reaching implications for road safety and military accountability, Punjab and Haryana high court has held that the Union of India cannot claim ""sovereign immunity"" in cases of negligent driving by Army personnel on public roads.""Sovereign immunity is not absolute, it operates only within a very narrow sphere of functions that are inextricably linked with the core sovereign powers of the State, and it cannot be invoked to shield routine administrative, operational, or vehicular acts of government servants from judicial scrutiny or civil liability,"" the HC has ruled.The court also observed that the state while exercising its powers, is bound to act in consonance with the Constitution and the will of the people, and cannot arrogate to itself supremacy that overrides the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed to its citizens.Justice Virinder Aggarwal passed these orders while awarding compensation to four civilians injured in a 1996 road accident involving a military truck. The bench overturned a 2001 decision of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT), Kurukshetra, which had dismissed the victims' compensation claims despite finding the Army driver negligent. The tribunal had ruled that the driver was performing a ""sovereign function,"" thereby shielding the Union of India from liability.Calling the tribunal's findings wholly unsustainable in law, the HC said negligent driving on a public road cannot be equated with a sovereign function to absolve liability.The court also reiterated that the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which originates from the English maxim ""rex non potest peccare - the king can do no wrong"", cannot be mechanically applied in the modern constitutional scheme of India.The HC further held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity has no application to the facts of the present case. The Union of India, being the employer and owner of the offending vehicle, is vicariously liable for the negligent act of its driver. The finding of the tribunal to the contrary is legally unsustainable and is hereby set aside.On Aug 16, 1996, a military truck, driven rashly while overtaking a bus on the GT Road near Khanpur Kolian village, Kurukshetra, collided head-on with a Maruti car. Five occupants of the car sustained serious injuries. FIRs, medical records, and witness testimonies had established the Army driver's fault.","Punjab and Haryana high court rules that the Union of India cannot claim ""sovereign immunity"" in cases of negligent driving by Army personnel.

How Brooklyn Beckham has built his personal fortune

Nicola Peltz’s Hollywood career and billionaire family backing

Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have become one of the hottest pairs of young celebrity couple watchers, thanks to both their famous surnames and the rarefied (and distinct) financial universes they inhabit. Bringing together British sports and fashion royalty with an American dynasty of Hollywood and high finance, their marriage endowed a joint fortune that captivated public imagination.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have a combined net worth of about $60 million in 2025. While these fortunes sit next door to much larger family fortunes that continue to define their lifestyle, opportunities, and financial safety, this figure represents their earnings from creative careers that brought them to our attention in the first place.Anybody with a last name Beckham could show up and just straight-up stomp the rest of them, but Brooklyn Beckham, son of famous footballer David Beckham and fashion designer Victoria Beckham, has been working hard to build up a career apart from the famous family. Most of his income has been through modeling campaigns, commercial photography assignments, and sponsored collaborations related to fashion, food, and lifestyle brands.Although his publishing and culinary projects have elicited a more erratic response from critics, brand tie-ins and social media collaborations have been a veritable financial goldmine. We estimate Brooklyn Beckham to have a dominantly stagnant commercial but blockbuster, sparse personal net worth of $10 million by 2025.Nicola Peltz brings a different financial profile to the marriage. She also has a long history of acting in television productions and major film franchises, as well as modeling and other appearances in the fashion industry for more income. All of these put together have allowed her to acquire an estimated personal net worth of around 50 million dollars.In addition to her personal income, Nicola Peltz has the granddaddy of all sources of wealth, as she is the daughter of hedge fund mogul Nelson Peltz. While this family fortune is not technically included in her individual wealth, it bestows one access to large amounts of money, such as through luxury real estate, private investments, and elite business circles.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz are the perfect modern union between a famous couple whose individual monetary pursuits are inexplicably tied to familial connections. A combined $60 million net worth certainly reflects what each of them has, but the rest of their family lines seem to continue giving them public exposure and wifely earnings power.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

The drive was carried out by Bengaluru Solid Waste Management Limited (BSWML) to clear encroachments for a proposed solid waste processing unit.Over 300 residents protesting near the minister's Sahakar Nagar home demanded alternative housing and temporary shelters for those left homeless after the demolition. Gowda, who represents the Byatarayanapura constituency under which the area falls, is said to have assured a discussion with the residents' representatives Monday.The residents claimed the demolition drive, which began at 4:30am, was conducted without any notice and told TOI that power supply to the area had been cut three days earlier.Several organisations, including Dalit Sangharsha Samithi, Praja Vimochana Chaluvali, and Dudiyuva Janara Vedike, are representing the residents and sought temporary shelters and relief centres for those who lost their homes.Accusing the govt of being against dalits and minorities, activist Kolageri Ganesh accused Karnataka of following BJP's and UP CM Yogi Adityanath's policy ""against the poor"".He urged housing minister Zameer Ahmed Khan to intervene in the matter.Pooja HM of Dudiyuva Janara Vedike also accused the govt of being anti-poor as officials had only instructed residents of Waseem Layout orally to vacate three days earlier without issuing any written notice.The govt issued a provisional order under section 94C of the Karnataka Land and Revenue Act (pertaining to the grant of land in case of construction of a dwelling house in occupied land). ""The people are not aware of the formalities since many are uneducated. The order implies that the residents have a right over the land.

I lost my husband during the Covid pandemic.""Her neighbour, Arifa Begum, said she paid Rs 3 lakh to an agent who ensured all paperwork would be done. ""I have spent a total of Rs 18 lakh on my house, which was on a 30x40 sqft plot,"" she added.The residents said that those affected people include newborns, pregnant women and senior citizens, and added that some animals lost their lives during the demolition.BSWML: Land was illegally occupiedBSWML, in a statement, said approximately 5 acres of land earmarked for it was encroached upon, with more than 150 temporary sheds and houses constructed on the site.

BENGALURU: Air India’s decision to discontinue its nonstop San Francisco services from Bengaluru and Mumbai from March 1 has triggered confusion and concern among passengers who have made bookings, particularly for travel beyond Feb 28.An AI spokesperson told TOI , “The airline has made changes to its North America schedule to better deploy capacity and manage rising costs linked to ongoing airspace restrictions.”As part of the rejig, AI will significantly scale up its Delhi operations to North America. The airline will increase Delhi–San Francisco services from seven flights a week to 10, while Delhi–Toronto services will also rise to 10 weekly flights.The airline said passengers affected by the withdrawal of the Bengaluru–San Francisco and Mumbai–San Francisco routes will be re-accommodated on alternative services or offered full refund. “Air India will seek to reinstate non-stop service from Bengaluru and Mumbai, should airspace restrictions ease,” the spokesperson added.Responding to the news on social media, a passenger took to X, “I have flights booked on BLR–SFO (with return) in May and DEL–SFO (with return) on May 26. What do I do?”Others questioned the rationale behind the move, noting the Bengaluru–San Francisco route is largely operated using Boeing 777300ER aircraft.“We booked months ago to avoid last-minute hassles — now, everything is uncertain,” said Nakul Tirtha, a Bengaluru-based tech professional.A other Air India passenger posted, ‘I have family travel planned for May. What happens to our return tickets?” An Air India official stated that they would reach out to the affected persons.However, while the expanded Delhi services of Air India are expected to absorb some of the displaced demand, the withdrawal of direct flight connectivity to San Francisco from Bengaluru and Mumbai is likely to have an impact on the tech professionals and business travellers who rely heavily on non-stop links to the west coast of United State s of America.","Air India will discontinue its nonstop San Francisco services from March 1.

NEW DELHI: The wind came to the rescue of Delhiites. It picked up towards late night on Saturday and continued blowing throughout Sunday, resulting in the blanket of fog thinning and the air quality improving a bit.The air quality index (AQI), which entered the severe category on Saturday evening — it had been recorded at 409 at 8pm — was at 377 (very poor) at 4pm on Sunday.Though it had initially been predicted that the index will remain in the severe range (above 400 on a scale of 500) on Sunday and Monday, the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi later said the air quality is likely to hover within the very poor band until Wednesday.Central Pollution Control Board's data showed that out of 39 active air quality monitoring stations in Delhi, the AQI was above 400 at 13 stations on Sunday. Ayanagar was the lone one to record a poor reading (293).Though the city experienced moderate fog, 107 flights were cancelled and 500 delayed at Delhi's IGI Airport due to low visibility at several other airports across north India.Unlike most of Saturday, when calm conditions prevailed, easterly winds of up to 6 to 10 kmph started blowing into the city from 11.30 pm on Saturday and continued till 6.30 am on Sunday.Its speed was between 4 and 8 kmph during the daytime.

The visibility at IGI Airport was above 1,000m from 12.30 pm to 7 pm, said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. In contrast, most parts of Delhi recorded lower visibility of around 200 to 800m during Sunday.The Met department issued a yellow alert (be aware) for moderate fog at most places and dense fog at isolated areas in the city in the early morning hours of Monday. Moderate to shallow fog is likely from Tuesday to Thursday.Though IMD earlier forecast that ‘cold day' conditions was likely to prevail in isolated areas in Delhi, no station met the criterion on Sunday. Safdarjung (16.9 degrees Celsius) and Palam (16.3) reeled under cold day conditions on Saturday.A ‘cold day' is declared in Delhi when the minimum temperature is below 10 degrees C and the departure of maximum from the normal is 4.5 notches or more.As the sun briefly came out on Sunday, the day temperature gradually started rising.

Meanwhile, Jharkhand's railway division cancelled eight trains due to heightened wild elephant movement near tracks, marking the third consecutive cancellation to prioritize animal safety.

Seven MEMU & 1 passenger train cancelled: Rlys

GUWAHATI/JAMSHEDPUR: Elephant deaths from a Rajdhani Express collision in central Assam rose to eight Sunday as a calf died during treatment, while rail authorities in Jharkhand cancelled eight trains from Dec 22 to 24 amid heightened movement of wild herds near tracks.A male calf — less than 15 days old — died at Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation in Kaziranga, said Kampur range forest officer Shamim Aktar. “It suffered a leg fracture, spinal injury and internal injuries,” he said.Seven elephants, including four calves, were killed on the spot when New Delhibound Rajdhani from Sairang in Mizoram hit a herd around 2am Saturday at Sangjurai village in Assam’s Hojai district. No intrusion detection system was installed at the site and villagers said dense night fog may have contributed.Northeast Frontier Railway imposed a 30kmph speed cap for trains in a 1km radius of the crash zone and posted a watchman round-the-clock over 500m on either side. Measures will stay for a week, with further directions expected.Close on the heels of the disaster in Assam, the Chakradharpur (CKP) railway division under the South Eastern Railway (SER) on Sunday announced to cancel as many as eight trains from Dec 22 to 24 in the wake of increased movement of jumbos in the area.Notably, this is the third time that the CKP division has announced the cancellation of trains in quick succession.The CKP division attributed the cancellation to the frequent movement of elephants on three different sections under its limits.Currently, the Rourkela-Chakradharpur, Rourkela-Jharsuguda, and Rourkela-Nuagaon sections are affected by the frequent movement of elephants, prompting officials to announce the cancellation of seven MEMU and one passenger train on the up and down routes.The railway informed that Tata-Barbil-Tata MEMU (68125/68126), Tata-GuaTata MEMU (68019/68020), Chakradharpur-Rourkela Chakradharpur MEMU (68025/68026), Tata-Rourkela-Tata MEMU (68043/ 68044), Hatia-Jharsuguda Hatia MEMU (18175/18176), Rourkela-Jharsuguda Rourkela MEMU (68029/ 68030), Chakradharpur-Tata-Kharagpur-Chakradhar pur MEMU (68010/68009/ 68066), besides Birmitrapur-Barsuan-Birmitrapur passenger (58151/58152), have been cancelled.Earlier, the divisional railway cancelled five passenger trains on December 18 and 19, and then on December 20-21, four trains were cancelled on the same route. Now, the cancellation has been extended for the third consecutive time. Notably, the movement of elephants has not only increased on the tracks in the Chakradharpur division but also in villages near the tracks.Earlier on Friday, a villager was trampled to death in the Manoharpur block of the West Singhbhum district.Railway officials have stated that the back-to-back cancellation of trains is driven by their decision not to take any chances regarding the safety of the elephants. The senior divisional commercial manager of Chakradharpur, Aditya Choudhary, said that the long-distance trains moving on the Howrah-Mumbai route are taking necessary precautions on the identified route.“Along with the trackclearance teams doing their job, the pilots of the longdistance trains have been categorically asked to follow the standard operating procedures while moving through the identified sections,” Choudhary said.","Seven elephants, including four calves, were killed on the spot when New Delhibound Rajdhani from Sairang in Mizoram hit a herd around 2am Saturday at Sangjurai village in Assam’s Hojai district.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen Huang, CEO of $4.4 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Billionaire philanthropist and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott donated over $7.1 billion in 2025, marking her biggest-ever annual give away. As per an essay posted on her website Yield Giving, the donations were made to 186 organizations around the world including universities, environmental nonprofits, and groups fighting for equality. “Since my post last December, I’ve given $7,166,000,000 to organizations doing work all over the world,” she wrote in the blog post. “This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year,” she further added.Earlier this year, MacKenzie Scott, 55 donated $80 million to Howard University, marking one of the largest single donations in the school’s 158-year history and continuing her recent surge of major contributions to diversity and equity causes.Other than Howard, Scott gave $42 million to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students, alongside other eight-figure commitments to Native student scholars and HBCU endowments through the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).According to Forbes, Scott’s 2025 donation puts her behind Warren Buffet and Bill Gates in terms of lifetime giving.In September this year, MacKenzie Scott revealed in a regulatory filing that she had reduced her Amazon stake by $12.6 billion. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Scott has cut her holdings in the e-commerce giant by nearly 42%.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Monday. While Nifty50 was above 26,100, BSE Sensex surged over 450 points. At 9:24 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,121.75, up 155 points or 0.60%. BSE Sensex was at 85,401.92, up 473 points or 0.56%.This week marks the beginning of the year-end festive season and will be shortened due to the Christmas holiday.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “It appears that the market is heading for a year end rally. Two factors that can accelerate this rally are the sharp reversal in the rupee and the FIIs turning buyers in the cash market. These two factors which are mutually reinforcing can trigger short covering in the market helping the benchmark indices to scale higher highs.

Can Indians work from home while waiting for H-1B visas? Immigration lawyer offers advice as US investor warns of employer impatience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-indians-work-from-home-while-waiting-for-h-1b-visas-immigration-lawyer-offers-advice-as-us-investor-warns-of-employer-impatience/articleshow/126106661.cms,"Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026





Indian professionals seeking H-1B visas are facing long delays, with interviews and visa stamping for both new applicants and transfers now being pushed from early 2026 into late 2026. The situation left many workers stuck in India for months, and worse was the career disruption and employer patience that came along with the issue, according to American Ed-tech chair and investor Hany Girgis.“What was meant to be a U.S.-based work visa is quietly turning into offshore work by default… without the cost savings,” Girgis said on X. He said that workers can legally continue working for US employers from India if permitted, but the extended delays may test employer patience.According to American Bazaar, applicants and visa tracking data indicate that many January 2026 interview slots at US consulates in India have now been deferred to as late as September 2026.Immigration lawyer Rajiv Khanna said, “H-1B India January visa appointments are being pushed to September.” The backlog affects first-time H-1B applicants as well as workers seeking renewals after travelling abroad.The delays have worsened in recent weeks, with several H-1B and H-4 visa interviews scheduled for December 2025 being cancelled or postponed to March 2026.US consular posts attribute the changes to a new online presence review process for H-1B and H-4 applicants that took effect on December 15.“There isn’t much that can be done because this administration has created a systemic problem that appears deliberate. What was the extreme emergency that the social media vetting policy had to be changed and people’s lives upended overnight? This has become a universal problem for H-1B employees applying in India,” Khanna said.He also flagged policies under the Trump administration that applicants can only apply for a visa from their country of nationality or residence, and how it puts strains on employers and employees.The extended wait times forced workers to delay joining dates, travel plans, and job switches, affecting both individuals and US businesses.Some applicants have asked whether they can legally continue working while waiting in India. Khanna confirmed, “One of the key issues I’ve been asked about is, can we work while we are in India? The answer is yes.” He cautioned workers to comply with local tax regulations while working remotely.These delays come alongside changes to the H-1B programme under the GOP government. Earlier in 2025, US government narrowed the definition of specialty occupations, imposed stricter degree requirements, and added compliance obligations for employers. A one-time $100,000 fee on new H-1B petitions and expanded social media checks for digital footprint. All these factors combined have slowed processing, creating hurdles for Indian IT professionals.","Indian professionals seeking H-1B visas are facing long delays, with interviews and visa stamping for both new applicants and transfers now being pushed from early 2026 into late 2026.
