is on

DHAKA: Bangladesh's main opposition party BNP on Tuesday urged India to extradite deposed PM Sheikh Hasina to face trial in murder and other cases registered against her since she took flight on August 5 in the face of a student-led uprising. ""It is our call to you that you should hand her over to government of Bangladesh in a legal way.The people of this country have given the decision for her trial.Let her face that trial,"" BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said in Dhaka after paying tribute to the party's founder president Ziaur Rahman.Alamgir said Hasina being allowed to take refuge in India isn't aligned with the country's commitment to upholding democratic principles. ""Staying there, she has started various plots to thwart the revolution that happened in Bangladesh.""Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated in courts for any ""extraditable crime"", including financial offences liable to invite a minimum punishment of a year in jail.BNP, whose ailing chairperson and ex-PM Khaleda Zia was freed from house arrest after Hasina fled, said the murder and extortion cases filed against the latter were in the ""extraditable"" category.The bilateral treaty isn't applicable to cases that are ""political in nature"", although this exemption is not available to those charged with serious crimes like murder, sources said.India can turn down any request for Hasina's extradition by citing Article 8 of the treaty, which allows the signatories to refuse requests that have ""not been made in good faith and in the interests of justice"". The BNP secretary general alleged that Hasina's Awami League was ""still conspiring in New Delhi to falsify the victory"" of students and other citizens of Bangladesh. ""I am saying this strongly, and we want to make it clear that I do not think that India can get much love from the people by sheltering the enemy of the people of Bangladesh, who had to flee from the country,"" Alamgir said.Awami League has criticised Bangladesh's interim government for cases registered against Hasina, terming them ""false and politically motivated"".","Bangladesh and India have extradition treaty based on which they are required to hand over people against whom proceedings have been initiated. India can turn down any request for Hasina's extradition by citing Article 8 of the treaty, which allows the signatories to refuse requests that have not been made in good faith.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112666692,imgsize-1336226,width-400,resizemode-4/112666692.jpg"

70 missions to be launched in 5 years; first uncrewed Gaganyaan launch in December: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-missions-to-be-launched-in-5-years-first-uncrewed-gaganyaan-launch-in-december-isro-chief/articleshow/112666553.cms,"NEW DELHI: Isro chairman S Somanath said on Tuesday that the space agency is going to launch 50+ satellites and several scientific missions totalling 70 launches for various users, departments and ministries in the next five years. He also said the country’s first uncrewed Gaganyaan mission is likely to be launched in December this year.Somanath revealed this on the sidelines of a function organised by AICTE in collaboration with Isro, Indian Space Association (ISpA), and IN-SPACe, titled “Creating a Space Ecosystem: A New Era—Igniting Young Minds for Space Exploration.” The event also featured the launch of the AICTE-approved model curriculum for space technology and the release of a book titled ‘Introduction to Finite Element Analysis’, co-authored by Isro chief S Somanath and Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre director S Unnikrishnan Nair.Elaborating on the upcoming satellites to be launched, the Isro chief said over 50+ upcoming satellite missions will include four navigation satellites, weather satellites, Cartosat series, Resourcesat series, Oceansat and high-throughput communication satellites.After the successful moon landing on Aug 23 last year, which will be celebrated as National Space Day, Somanath said Isro has completed design work for Chandrayaan-4 and -5 missions. “We are now waiting for the govt’s approval,” he said.About Bharatiya Antariksha Station project, Somanath said India’s space station will have five modules. The first module is scheduled to be launched in 2028. Design work for it is already completed and a full report has been submitted to govt for approval.”On the first Gaganyaan unmanned mission, Somanath said “most of the rocket stages have reached SHAR (Sriharikota). Only the crew module is being prepared at Thiruvananthapuram (centre) and the service module at UR Rao Satellite Centre (Bengaluru). All systems will reach Sriharikota in one and a half months and the launch will be in December.”After the successful launch of the final development flight of SSLV (mini rocket) recently, Somanath said, “We are now working on SSLV technology transfer. The technology will be transferred either to a company or a consortium of companies based on who will be the highest bidder. A request for interest has been floated and more than 10 companies and consortia have evinced interest. Some of them have been shortlisted. After the approved price is paid, two rockets will be realised on a commercial basis by the company as Isro and NSIL will hand-hold the company. Thereafter, they will manufacture the rockets on their own.”The Isro chief also gave details about the next-generation launches. “We have a rocket LVM-3 with a 4-5 tonne carrying capability. We need to double this capability. Though the cost of the existing rocket is high, it is still competitive. But we have to bring the cost down substantially. So, we are going for a PPP mode to develop a next-generation rocket.”About ongoing astronaut training in the US for the International Space Station mission, Somanath said the two astronauts are “currently undergoing an initial phase of a three-month training (in Houston). Thereafter, they will be trained in other facilities”. “One of them will then be sent to ISS, which is likely in the middle of next year,” he said.Lieutenant General AK Bhatt, director general of ISpA, who was also at the event, said, “ISpA is actively working to facilitate private sector participation in India's space economy and we believe that the synergy between the govt initiatives and private enterprises will be the key driver of innovation and growth in this sector. We need increased collaboration between the academia, the industry and the research institutions to foster innovation and accelerate technological development. Investment in STEM education is crucial to nurture the next generation of space scientists and engineers.”",Isro chairman S Somanath said on Tuesday that the space agency is going to launch 50+ satellites and several scientific missions totalling 70 launches in the next five years.

A revised and updated Declaration is likely to be announced during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Japan later this year for the annual summit.As they discussed growing Chinese assertiveness in South and East China Seas, India and Japan also agreed to explore the possibility of security and defence cooperation with third countries for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.""A free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific is the top priority for both our countries.

While there was no announcement of a deal for transfer of stealth naval ship antennas to India as reports from Tokyo said, the joint statement expressed satisfaction about the progress made for the proposed procurement by India of what is known as Unified Complex Radio Antenna (UNICORN).There were talks also on major regional and global issues, including the Russia-Ukraine war, and the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining and strengthening the rules-based international order founded on the principles of the UN Charter, respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful settlement of disputes without resorting to the threat or use of force. They emphasised the need for all countries to refrain from any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo.While the ministers, unlike in the first 2+2 joint statement in 2019, didn’t name Pakistan, they unequivocally condemned cross-border terrorism, and called for bringing the perpetrators of 26/11 Mumbai, Pathankot, and other attacks to justice. ""They called for concerted actions against all UN-listed terrorist groups including Al Qaeda, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and their proxy groups, and to take resolute actions to root out terrorists’ safe havens, eliminate terrorist financing channels, and halt cross-border movement of terrorists,"" said the joint statement.Jaishankar said India and Japan are resolute in their opposition to terrorism, including cross-border terrorism.

"Government scraps lateral entry drive, says PM wants to apply quotas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-scraps-lateral-entry-drive-says-pm-wants-to-apply-quotas/articleshow/112663460.cms,"Government: Will review lateral entry policy to ensure

social justice

NEW DELHI: Faced with opposition, government on Tuesday cancelled the move to recruit 45 mid-level bureaucrats through "" lateral entry "" and announced the extension of quotas to such inductions as well.Government asked Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) to withdraw the advertisement for 45 lateral inductions for the posts of joint secretaries, directors and deputy secretaries, in what is being seen as a swift response to allegations from Congress and others in the opposition that the Centre had been making appointments laterally to dodge the requirement for caste quotas.BJP's ally, Union food processing minister Chirag Paswan of LJP had also opposed the decision.""Today, PM Narendra Modi has reaffirmed his commitment to Babasaheb's Constitution and has taken a major decision to apply the principles of reservation in lateral recruitment by UPSC... (This) clearly shows the commitment of PM to take the benefit and to do justice to the weakest section of society,"" I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnav told DD News.Earlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UPSC chairperson Preeti Sudan, personnel minister Jitendra Singh urged her to cancel the ad for lateral entry positions following instructions from the PM, and referred to Modi's decision to apply quotas to lateral entries.Personnel minister Jitendra Singh also mentioned that reservation in employment is a cornerstone of government’s social justice framework, aimed at addressing historical injustices and promoting inclusivity. “It is important that the constitutional mandate towards social justice is upheld so that deserving candidates from marginalised communities get their rightful representation in government services,” Singh said in his letter to the UPSC chief.Opposition celebrated the decision as its “victory” and emphasised that it forced government to retrace its steps. government, for its part, said lateral inductions, without provision for caste quotas, began under Congress governments.Singh said the policy for lateral inductions, where quotas are not applied because positions are treated as “specialist” “single-cadre” posts would be reviewed and changed in context of PM’s “focus on ensuring social justice”. Under current norms, quota system is not applicable where there are less than three recruitments.Officials said government will “undertake an exercise” to see how reservation norms can be applied in lateral entry. “government has followed due process that’s fair and transparent in the last three batches of lateral entry. Now since it has been pointed out that there should be reservation in such recruitment as well and as there is a sentiment, government will review this. We are open to suggestions,” said a senior official.Sources said of the currently serving 57 officers recruited through lateral entry, four are SC and eight OBC. A senior official said the current norm of reservation in direct recruitment — 15.7% for SCs, 7% for STs, 27% for OBCs and 10% for economically weaker section (EWS) — can be applied only when all posts for each category are clubbed and not taken as single-cadre posts.In the letter, Singh referred to how lateral entry was endorsed by Second Administrative Reforms Commission chaired by Congress’ Veerappa Moily and that recommendations of sixth pay commission in 2013 were in the same direction.The minister said there have been many instances of high profile appointments, including of secretaries without following any process of reservation.Taking on previous Congress-led UPA governments, the letter mentioned, “...it is well known that members of the infamous National Advisory Council used to run a super-bureaucracy that controlled PMO.”Slamming Congress for double standards, I&B minister Ashwini asked, “Manmohan Singh ji, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and before that Vijay Kelkar ji became finance secretary through lateral entry. Did Congress take care of principle of reservation at that time?”","Government asked Union Public Service Commission ( UPSC ) to withdraw the advertisement for 45 lateral inductions for the posts of joint secretaries, directors and deputy secretaries.

It also directed West Bengal govt to form a committee of three experts, including a clinical psychologist and a social scientist, to interact with the girl to help her make an informed choice whether she wants to continue to remain in the company of the accused or avail of the state's benefits.Referring to various observations made by the HC, including carving out a non-existing category of ""romantic relationships"" in rape cases and suggesting amendment in laws to decriminalise consensual sexual acts involving adolescents above 16 years, the court said the HC's remarks were shocking.""A judgment of the court cannot contain the judge's personal opinions on various subjects. Similarly, advisory jurisdiction cannot be exercised by the court by incorporating advice to the parties or advice in general. The judge has to decide a case and not preach. The judgment cannot contain irrelevant and unnecessary material. A judgment must be in simple language and should not be verbose. Brevity is the hallmark of quality judgment. We must remember that judgment is neither a thesis nor a piece of literature. However, we find that the impugned judgment contains personal opinion of the Judges advice to the younger generation and advice to the legislature,"" the court said.The bench agreed that the relationship was consensual as there was no evidence of enticing the victim and she had left the house on her own but held that the offences punishable under Section 6 of Pocso Act and Sub- sections (2)(n) and (3) of Section 376 of the IPC were made out. It said whether such offence arises from a romantic relationship is irrelevant. The court also expressed concern over the Child Welfare Committees in states not doing its job in reaching out to the children in need of care and protection.""It is the responsibility of the State to take care of helpless victims of such heinous offences. Time and again, we have held that the right to live a dignified life is an integral part of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution... The minor child, who is the victim of the offences under the Pocso Act, is also deprived of the fundamental right to live a dignified and healthy life. The same is the case of the child born to the victim as a result of the offence... Therefore immediately after the knowledge of the commission of a heinous offence under the Pocso Act, the State, its agencies and instrumentalities must step in and render all possible aid to the victim children, which will enable them to lead a dignified life,"" the bench said.",Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan not only set aside the high court's remarks but also its verdict in 2018 of acquitting an accused who was in physical relationship with a 14-year old minor girl.

Impact on daily life due to Bharat Bandh

On August 21, 2024, India will witness a nationwide protest known as the Bharat Bandh , organised by the Reservation Bachao Sangharsh Samiti in response to a recent Supreme Court ruling on SC/ST reservations. This bandh is expected to have a significant impact across various sectors. Here’s a comprehensive guide on what to expect on this day.According to an ET report, the Supreme Court of India recently ruled that states can create sub-categories within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) for the purposes of reservation.The decision is aimed at ensuring that those who are most in need within these groups receive priority. However, this ruling has sparked widespread controversy and opposition from several social and political organisations. Critics argue that it undermines the principles of reservation and could lead to increased division among communities. The Bharat Bandh is a response to this ruling, with the aim of challenging and reversing it.In preparation for the bandh, law enforcement agencies have heightened their alert levels. A high-level meeting, including divisional commissioners, district magistrates, and senior police officers, was held to ensure effective management of the situation, as per reports. Western Uttar Pradesh has been identified as a particularly sensitive area, and extra precautions have been taken there. DGP UR Sahoo stated, ""We have asked our officials to organise meetings with groups calling for the bandh, as well as with market associations, to facilitate better cooperation.""While the Bharat Bandh is designed to protest the Supreme Court ruling, its impact will vary depending on location. Urban areas might experience more significant disruptions compared to rural regions. Individuals are advised to stay updated through local news and government announcements to navigate the potential disruptions effectively.","The Bharat Bandh will take place on August 21, 2024.

India and Japan have a shared vision of the Indo-Pacific. There is growing convergence and common outlook on issues of peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.The two countries also welcomed the growing diversity and frequency of their defence exercises and exchanges, and resolved to enhance the scope and complexity of these engagements.Japan is taking part in India’s ongoing multi-nation “Tarang Shakti” air combat exercise. This follows after IAF deployed four Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, two C-17 Globemaster-III strategic lift aircraft and one IL-78 mid-air refueler for the first-ever air combat exercise with Japan called “Veer Guardian"" at the Hyakuri air base last year.Japan will also take part in the top-tier Malabar naval exercise to be hosted by India in the Bay of Bengal in October.

The contracts for these positions typically range from three to five years, with the possibility of extensions based on performance. The goal is to address complex governance and policy implementation challenges by leveraging external expertise.Lateral entry is not a new concept, as it was initially recommended by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) established in 2005 during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government led by Congress. Chaired by Veerappa Moily, the ARC advocated for lateral entry to fill roles requiring specialised knowledge unavailable within traditional civil services. The recommendations focused on recruiting professionals from the private sector, academia and PSUs to enhance policy implementation and governance.","The practice of recruiting individuals from outside the traditional government service cadres to fill mid and senior-level positions is known as lateral entry into bureaucracy.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, and several other opposition leaders had opposed the lateral entry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112647362,imgsize-1411732,width-400,resizemode-4/112647362.jpg"
How to verify the authenticity of your GST bill: Essential steps to avoid fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-to-verify-the-authenticity-of-your-gst-bill-essential-steps-to-avoid-fraud/articleshow/112651357.cms,"Steps to ensure your GST bill is fraud-free

Verify GSTIN

Check invoice number

Verify invoice value and tax amount

Confirm supplier's signature

Check tax payment status

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) system was implemented in India in 2017 to unify taxation and enhance transparency and efficiency in the tax process. GST bills are frequently used to settle claims and apply for Income Tax Credits. As a consumer, it’s vital to confirm the authenticity of your GST bill to avoid being deceived.Ensuring the authenticity of your GST bill is vital for avoiding fraud and maintaining the integrity of your financial transactions.Since GST bills are essential for settling claims and claiming Income Tax Credits, it’s important to be aware of potential counterfeit documents. Verifying your GST bill helps protect against inaccuracies and fraudulent activities that can affect both personal and business finances.Taking these precautions ensures that your transactions remain transparent and that you are not at risk of falling prey to fraudulent schemes.To ensure the authenticity of a GST bill, start by checking the GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) of the supplier. Each supplier is assigned a unique 15-digit GSTIN, which includes the state code, PAN, and a specific registration number. Valid GSTIN details—such as taxpayer type, registration date, registration location (state), legal and trade names of the business, UIN, or GSTIN status—can be verified on the GST portal.Next, confirm that the invoice number and date on the GST bill are correct. The invoice number should be unique and follow a consecutive sequence, while the invoice date must fall within the approved timeframe.Ensure that the GST bill reflects the accurate invoice value and tax amount. You can calculate the applicable tax using the appropriate GST rate and verify it using the GST calculator available on the GST website.The GST bill should have the signature of the supplier or their authorised representative. Check that this signature matches the one registered with the GST authorities.Lastly, verify the tax payment status of the supplier on the GST portal. If the tax for the invoice has been paid, it should be reflected in the GST return filed on the portal.Keep these verification steps in mind to protect yourself as a customer. If you discover a fraudulent GST bill , report it through the GST portal or the provided toll-free number.","The Goods and Services Tax (GST) system was implemented in India in 2017.

‘Valuations more expensive than Tesla’: Ola Electric stock surges 107% in just 7 days!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/valuations-more-expensive-than-tesla-ola-electric-surge-107-in-just-7-days/articleshow/112646018.cms,"Ola Electric stock price : The shares of Ola Electric surprised investors on Tuesday by surging an additional 8% to reach a new high of Rs 157.53 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Reports indicate that during Tuesday's trading session, a significant transaction involving 2.3 crore shares, equivalent to 0.5% of the company's equity and valued at Rs 352.9 crore, took place at an average price of Rs 151 per share.The electric vehicle (EV) stock has seen a remarkable 107% increase from its initial public offering (IPO) price of Rs 76 in just seven trading sessions.According to an ET report, it is now trading at a valuation higher than that of Elon Musk 's Tesla , which is listed on Wall Street!Several long-term investors have pointed out that Ola, with a market capitalization of approximately Rs 66,000 crore as of this morning, is now more expensive than Tesla. While Tesla is currently trading at 6.8 times its current enterprise value to sales ratio (EV/sales), Ola is trading at 7.8 times.In the June quarter, Ola Electric reported a 32% year-on-year increase in revenue, although the loss for the quarter widened to Rs 347 crore from Rs 267 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The company recently entered the electric motorcycle segment with the launch of Roadster, Roadster X, and Roadster Pro. Additionally, Ola Electric announced plans to integrate its cells into its vehicles starting from Q1 FY26.HSBC became the first brokerage to initiate coverage on Ola Electric's stock, setting a target price of Rs 140. Analysts suggest that new investors should wait for a more stable entry point or consider the stock as a long-term investment with a high risk-reward ratio. HSBC's valuation of Ola Electric is based on a DCF methodology, using a WACC of 10.0% and a long-term growth rate of 7.5%.""We use a DCF methodology to value Ola Electric. We use a WACC of 10.0% and a long-term growth rate of 7.5%. Our target price implies FY28e price/sales of 2.9x and an EV/EBITDA of 39x. We also provide a sensitivity matrix to gauge the sensitivity of Ola's valuation to different parameters.

Investors should be cautious, especially given the company's ongoing losses and the high volatility in its stock price.""Andrew Holland, a veteran investor from Avendus Capital, admitted that the rapid rally has left him puzzled as to whether Ola's IPO was underpriced. He was quoted as saying, ""I am really not sure what has driven this share price so high, to be honest and I do not know what has changed or what could have changed since the listing and prior to the listing that would have this.""HSBC's investment thesis for Ola Electric relies on four key factors: the EV penetration curve in India, Ola's market share and competitive intensity, regulatory evolution and government support, and the success or failure of Ola's battery manufacturing unit. The brokerage believes that in the near term (12-24 months), regulatory support will remain intact, allowing Ola to maximize volumes and achieve better operating leverage, enabling the company to absorb a potential reduction in regulatory support.","Electric vehicle (EV) stock has seen a remarkable 107% increase from its initial public offering (IPO) price of Rs 76 in just seven trading sessions.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery that will astound one and all: a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea, also often referred to as a ""super continent"".Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs. Truly an exciting find!The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s advanced age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists study dinosaur fossils to learn about their behavior, diet, and appearance. Fossilized bones, teeth, footprints, and even eggs have been found, offering insights into these ancient creatures. There were over 1,000 different species of dinosaurs identified so far, ranging from the plant-eating sauropods to the fierce carnivorous theropods, showcasing their incredible diversity.Did you like this article?

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Ex-Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia's bank accounts to be unfrozen after 17 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/ex-bangladesh-pm-khaleda-zias-bank-accounts-to-be-unfrozen-after-17-years/articleshow/112667150.cms,"DHAKA: Tax authorities in Bangladesh have decided to unfreeze the bank accounts of Bangladesh Nationalist Party Chairperson Khaleda Zia , 17 years after they were blocked. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) on Monday instructed banks to unfreeze the accounts of BNP Chairperson Zia, the Daily Star newspaper reported.In August 2007, the NBR's Central Intelligence Cell directed banks to freeze the accounts of the BNP Chairperson, who has been elected Bangladesh's prime minister twice since 1990.The decision was based on a recommendation of a panel formed during the then Army-backed caretaker government, said a senior official of the NBR.Since then, her accounts have remained blocked. The BNP has on several occasions demanded that they be unfrozen.Later, she was allowed to withdraw a certain amount of money every month from Rupali Bank's Shaheed Moinul Road branch of Dhaka Cantonment for running regular expenses.The then caretaker government also blocked Sheikh Hasina's bank accounts but they were unfreezed after she became prime minister.The latest move comes after a mass uprising toppled Hasina, a long-time rival of Khaleda, on August 5, ending the Bangladesh Awami League's 15-year rule. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworn in on August 8.Zia, 79, was released from jail after Hasina, 76, fled to India on August 5. Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.The NBR said they received an application from Khaleda's lawyer on Sunday seeking to unfreeze the accounts.""As there are no tax-related issues pending investigation relating to her, we have advised banks to unlock all her accounts. We have asked them to take immediate action and provide a compliance report,"" the official was quoted as saying.","Tax authorities in Bangladesh have decided to unfreeze the bank accounts of Bangladesh Nationalist Party Chairperson Khaleda Zia.

In 2007, the greater adjutant stork, locally known as the hargila , faced imminent extinction in Assam, India, with fewer than 450 individuals remaining. Biologist Dr. Purnima Devi Barman spearheaded a groundbreaking conservation effort, rallying 10,000 rural women to protect the storks and reframe them as cultural symbols rather than omens of ill fortune.This initiative, known as the Hargila Army , has led to a remarkable recovery, with the stork’s population now exceeding 1,800. Recognized by the 2024 Whitley Gold Award, Barman is expanding her efforts to ensure the stork’s continued resurgence and global conservation impact.Dr. Barman enlisted the help of 10,000 rural women, forming what would become known as the 'Hargila Army' or 'Stork Sisters'. These women played a crucial role in protecting the storks' nests and shifting the perception of these prehistoric-looking scavengers from symbols of bad omen to positive cultural icons.The success of this grassroots movement was evident when the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reclassified the stork from Endangered to Near Threatened in December 2023. Since 2007, the population in Assam has surged to over 1,800.In recognition of her remarkable efforts, Dr. Barman was honored with the 2024 Whitley Gold Award by the Whitley Fund for Nature (WFN). This prestigious accolade celebrates grassroots conservation leaders and provides vital support for future initiatives. With the funding from this award, Dr. Barman plans to double the Hargila Army to 20,000 women and extend the conservation efforts to the Indian state of Bihar and Cambodia, targeting all remaining breeding grounds of the stork.Dr. Barman’s conservation efforts extend beyond safeguarding the storks. Her work has empowered thousands of women, enhancing their livelihoods and catalysing social change in their villages. Educational programs in local schools are integral to her strategy, fostering a new generation of allies for the stork.The Hargila army's vision for the futureThe Hargila Army’s expansion aims to increase the stork population to 5,000 by 2030. This ambitious goal includes extending the conservation work to Cambodia and Bihar, emphasizing community involvement and education. As Dr. Barman puts it, “Magic happens when we involve communities. The Hargila Army is like a sisterhood network among the women.”The Hargila Army’s expansion aims to increase the stork population to 5,000 by 2030.

She claims that the airline failed to properly train its staff and ensure the safe operation of the beverage cart in the plane's aisle. Hamilton is seeking unspecified damages for her injuries.Neither Hamilton’s attorney nor a Delta spokesperson commented on the lawsuit.This lawsuit adds to Delta’s recent legal troubles.

The flight, traveling from Detroit to Amsterdam, was diverted after several passengers fell ill due to spoiled meals. Upon landing, 12 passengers were treated by medical personnel. The total number of affected passengers remains unclear.A passenger named Virginia took to social media to express her frustration, writing on X (formerly Twitter), ""Delta I need to know how you're going to get me to Amsterdam today - I'm on the plane that's emergency landing at JFK because you served passengers 'contaminated' food - I don't need hotel/food vouchers I need to arrive in Amsterdam today.""","Gail Hamilton, the passenger, alleges that she was seated in an aisle seat on Delta Flight 263 on June 21, 2022, when the flight attendant “unexpectedly” hit her multiple times with a loaded cart.

The world’s largest snake species are a true marvel of nature, varying in length, size and shape. These colossal serpents thrive in diverse habitats and live in an ecosystem that has captivated herpetologists and scientists for decades. Predominantly belonging to Pythoniade and Boidae families, these snakes have garnered a name for themselves in the animal kingdom due to their immense size and weight.The world’s largest snake species, the green anaconda, inhabits the swamps and rivers of South America. Known for its immense size and strength, the green anaconda can grow up to 30 feet in length and weigh over 500 pounds, making it the heaviest snake species. Unlike other large snakes, such as the reticulated python, which holds the record for length, the anaconda's girth and muscular build set it apart.Snakes vary greatly in size, ranging from small blind snakes just a few inches long to massive anacondas and pythons that can exceed 30 feet. These giant snakes, the largest and heaviest reptiles on Earth, are renowned for their impressive size. Measuring the world’s largest snakes is challenging due to the risks of handling them and their tendency to move. Giant snakes like the reticulated python and the anaconda captivate global interest. There are fourteen massive snake species worldwide, each crucial to their ecosystems. These snakes range from small blind snakes to enormous anacondas and pythons over 30 feet long. Here is the list of 10 largest snake species include green anacondas from South America and reticulated pythons from Southeast Asia, known for lengths exceeding 20 feet.Uncover the list of the largest snake species in the world and their scientific names.Members of the Boa family, Green Anacondas are known for their gigantic size. They can grow up to 9 metres (30 feet) and weigh more than 250 pounds. This serpent gets its name from its olive colour and the spine of black circles. Two dark stripes that are found on their body help them camouflage. Native to northern regions of South America, these serpents thrive in slow-moving waters such as swamps and marshes.
