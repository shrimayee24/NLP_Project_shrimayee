BJP: No one will be homeless in Capital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-no-one-will-be-homeless-in-capital/articleshow/117185779.cms,"BJP

New Delhi: Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva on Sunday claimed that AAP's Arvind Kejriwal did not take any initiative in the past 10 years to improve the standard of living of people residing in slum clusters in Delhi.He said if BJP formed its govt in Delhi, it would ensure that every homeless person in Delhi received a house under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana . ""You (AAP) have been in office for over a decade. Please clarify if your govt, through DUSIB or any other department, has undertaken any significant effort to rehabilitate slum dwellers,"" he said.Sachdeva also gave some guarantees on behalf of BJP to Delhi's poor. ""Slum dwellers who wish to stay in their current areas will be allowed to remain there,"" he said. 'Jahan Jhuggi Wahin Makaan' scheme would continue to benefit slum residents, he added. Sachdeva promised that DUSIB and DDA would provide alternative houses or flats to slum dwellers.He was speaking to the press while celebrating his birthday with residents of Nehru Camp in Patparganj constituency during BJP's slum outreach campaign. He said, ""If the BJP comes to power, we will make this Nehru Camp a model slum with regards to sanitation by Jan 2026.""At a press conference held in Nehru Camp later, Sachdeva alleged that, in 10 years, Kejriwal allowed 50,000 flats, built under Rajiv Awas Yojana, in areas like Narela to turn into ruins, without allotting even one flat to any slum dweller. He said that, despite being in office for over 10 years, Kejriwal had done nothing to transform slum clusters into model settlements or improve the living standards of the residents. ""The last 10 years bear witness to the fact that Arvind Kejriwal can only provoke people, but cannot improve their lives,"" Sachdeva added.""Kejriwal claims to provide free electricity to the poor, but some residents of Nehru Camp in former deputy CM Manish Sisodia's constituency, Patparganj, are receiving monthly electricity bills ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 8,000. Additionally, they are forced to purchase drinking water,"" he claimed.""It is unfortunate that, despite Kejriwal's various claims, the income of Delhi's poor slum-dwelling families is consumed entirely by electricity bills and water costs,"" he claimed. He said every poor person knew that PM Modi had provided not just lakhs but crores of houses across villages and cities in the country, which was why every slum dweller today looked towards BJP.BJP is leveraging its in situ rehabilitation programmes to challenge AAP's stronghold. Recently, Modi inaugurated 1,675 newly built flats at Swabhiman Apartments in Ashok Vihar for JJ cluster residents and distributed keys to eligible recipients. He also announced plans for 3,000 more residential units.There are around 700 slums in Delhi, home to a significant portion of the city's population. These settlements often lack basic amenities like sanitation, with open drains exposing residents to poor living conditions. People from poor economic backgrounds work in sectors like construction, domestic work and street vending.","Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva claimed that AAP's Arvind Kejriwal did not take any initiative in the past 10 years to improve the standard of living of people residing in slum clusters.

NEW DELHI: Groundwater quality varies considerably across India, with certain states and UT such as Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya and J&K fully meeting BIS standards while states like Rajasthan, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh facing widespread contamination, shows a report recently released by 'Jal Shakti' ministry.A notable concern in the report, based on quality data at 15,259 groundwater monitoring locations and focused assessment at 4,982 trend stations across the country in 2023, is the ""elevated levels of uranium in several regions"". Rajasthan and Punjab are shown as regional hotspots of uranium contamination .The samples with high uranium concentrations were clustered in areas identified as 'over-exploited', 'critical', and 'semi-critical' groundwater stress zones, such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The report also reflects significant concerns over the quality of water due to high concentrations of nitrate, fluoride, arsenic, and iron in groundwater. Almost 20% of the samples exceeded the permissible limit for nitrate while 9% of samples had fluoride levels above the acceptable limit. Arsenic contamination was found in 3.5% of samples.""This is particularly worrying because long-term exposure to both contaminants (fluoride and arsenic) can have severe health consequences, including fluorosis (for fluoride) and cancer or skin lesions (for arsenic),"" said the report.Fluoride concentration exceeding the permissible limit is a major concern in Rajasthan, Haryana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. ""Although the monsoon season led to some improvement in fluoride levels in these states, the overall contamination levels remain alarmingly high,"" said the report.Rajasthan, TN and Maharashtra have some of the highest incidences of nitrate contamination , with over 40% of water samples exceeding the permissible limit. The report attributed it primarily to agricultural run-off and overuse of fertilizers.","A notable concern in the report is the ""elevated levels of uranium in several regions"" Rajasthan and Punjab are shown as regional hotspots of uranium contamination.

NEW DELHI: Focus more on creating facilities, amenities and better transportation network in zones in cities which naturally attract people and businesses, rather than developing new cities that push horizontal growth, PM Narendra Modi told top officials of housing and urban affairs ministry at a recent review meeting on urban sector, sources said.TOI has learnt that the ministry had made a detailed presentation on roadmap for urban development , focusing on planned growth of cities, before the PM. It was attended by top officials from PMO, cabinet secretariat, Niti Aayog and finance ministry.Modi was of the view that while certain areas or zones in existing cities have enough ingredients to attract people to come and work, it is difficult to convince or persuade people to shift to a new city.Following PM's suggestions, the ministry will start work on a better framework for transit-oriented development (TOD) for cities to push intensive and planned growth along transportation networks, sources said, adding the focus has to be on how to allow vertical development in influence zones of such transit corridors, & ensure decongestion to create enough public and open space.""While a lot depends on states as land use is a subject under 'State List', Centre must come up with a sound prescription and policy that can be replicated across states. But, while making such a policy, there is a need to take states on board and make them partners,"" said a former Union urban development secretary. He said to unclog areas around existing transit corridors, states need to permit higher floor area ratio (FAR) for vertical growth when redevelopment takes place.TOD is a planning and design strategy that aims at creating sustainable urban growth centres that are walkable, compact, and integrated with robust public transit. Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hong Kong SAR, Tokyo, and Singapore are some examples where TOD has been deployed effectively.","PM Narendra Modi told top officials of housing and urban affairs ministry at a recent review meeting on urban sector.

"Amid H-1B visa debate, some Indians lose jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-h-1b-visa-debate-some-indians-lose-jobs/articleshow/117181707.cms,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Indian professionals are facing the heat in the wake of a raging debate over H-1B visa reforms in the US. With President-elect Donald Trump's administration expected to introduce stricter immigration policies , several professionals have already been hit by job offer withdrawals, visa delays and warnings of potential layoffs.TOI spoke to eight professionals in the US and in Hyderabad, and at least three had their job offers abruptly revoked due to ""visa-related concerns"". Hyderabad-based software engineer Vaishnavi Puvvada is one such professional. Hired by a US tech giant in Dec, she was preparing to move to San Francisco when her offer was revoked. She had, meanwhile, quit her current job.""I was offered the job in Dec 2024 and since I had a written confirmation, I resigned from my current job,"" said the 28-year-old.The company cited ""changing visa dynamics"" as the reason for withdrawing the offer. ""I feel cheated. Why offer a role when you're not sure about sponsoring the visa? They later said that they will issue my offer letter again when the whole discussion is settled and there is a concrete decision after Donald Trump assumes office. But how long can I wait?"" Vaishnavi said.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, over 72% of the 380,000 H1B visas issued in 2023 went to Indians, most of whom work in STEM fields like data science, AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity. These professionals earn an average salary of $118,000 (about Rs 1.01 crore) annually.However, Indian professionals in the US are staring at an increasingly challenging environment as Trump's administration is expected to ""reform"" the H1B programme by increasing salary thresholds and costs for employers, aiming to prioritise American workers. There's also a growing backlash from MAGA supporters, who have often targeted the H1B visa, claiming it undermines American jobs and wages.The fear of unemployment is affecting those waiting for visa renewals. Saniya Haji, a cybersecurity consultant in Los Angeles, is facing delays in her H1B visa sponsorship.""Initially, the company promised to expedite the process (of sponsoring the H1B). But now they claim they are ‘waiting for clarity' on the potential visa reforms. The wait is agonising,"" she said.Saniya, who moved from Nagpur to US in 2022 for her master's degree, is unsure of her future. ""I was told they would register me for the H1B lottery in March 2025. But they haven't even initiated the preliminary stages of the process. Does it mean they are going to file for my H1B later, or are they going to just fire me if there is any major reform?"" she wondered.A woman from Telangana, who recently secured a position as a data analyst after an extended job search, now faces a new challenge as her company expresses uncertainty about sponsoring her visa.""Now that I have finally secured a position as a data analyst, the uncertainty around the H1B visa has come to haunt me. I can't even think of facing the trauma of unemployment again,"" she said, preferring to remain anonymous.Similarly, a software developer from Gujarat working in California, is feeling anxious despite holding a secure visa. His company recently announced workforce reductions, adding to his worries.""The management hasn't stated categorically if these layoffs are linked to visa issues, but the timing is suspicious,"" he said, choosing to remain anonymous. ""If we lose our job, we have to find another within 60 days to be able to continue staying here.""With unemployment at record levels and increasing uncertainties for Indian immigrants, he said finding a new job with H1B sponsorship within such a short period would be difficult. ""It is terrifying to think that I could lose my job and my legal status in the US any moment,"" he said.A senior immigration lawyer based in Georgia, speaking on condition of anonymity, elaborated on the broader implications. ""Employers are hesitant to commit to international hires because the rules are in flux. They fear investing resources in sponsorships that might later face rejection or scrutiny. Unfortunately, it's the employees who have to bear the brunt of this uncertainty,"" the lawyer said.","Indian professionals are facing the heat in the wake of a raging debate over H-1B visa reforms in the US.

10,000-acre land near Sangam given facelift, 8 permanent ghats created

SANGAM ( PRAYAGRAJ ): At the stroke of dawn on 'paush purnima' on Monday, when most of north India will remain ensconced in warm quilts to brave the Jan chill, more than 1 crore devotees will converge on the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati here and take a holy dip in a mass manifestation of devotion, penance and asceticism to mark the beginning of Maha Kumbh - the world's largest congregation of mankind.The spiritual sojourn will continue till February 26. Over 4 crore devotees are set to take the holy dip in the first two days. Over 35 lakh devotees reached Prayagraj by Sunday.UP CM Yogi Adityanath said Maha Kumbh “offers a unique experience to understand and witness India’s spiritual heritage”.Prayagraj has undergone a massive makeover with every renovated crossroad illuminated with vibrant lights to welcome a sea of humanity. The roads’ aesthetics have been enhanced through the strategic placement of more than 3 lakh plants and 1 lakh horticultural saplings, creating a visually pleasing environment. Most of the roads leading to Sangam were dazzling with welcome signs and LED butterfly lights on electric poles.This time, it will be an extended start for Maha Kumbh as two snan days, ‘paush purnima’ and ‘makar sankranti’, fall back to back on Monday and Tuesday. While ‘kalpvas’, the month-long stay of the devotees on the Sangam, will begin on Monday, the first of the three ‘ amrit snan ’ — the holy dip by nagas, seers and akharas — will take place on Tuesday. The cumulative footfall on the first two days is expected to be more than 4 crore.The other two ‘amrit snan’ days are ‘mauni amavasya’ on Jan 29 and ‘basant panchami’, on Feb 3. On Jan 29, which is considered the most auspicious of the days, more than 5 crore are expected to take the holy bath. The ‘kalpvas’ will culminate on Feb 12 with ‘maghi purnima’.Over 10,000-acre land near the Sangam has been given a facelift and eight permanent ghats have been created, over and above the existing temporary ones, to make it the biggest-ever religious event.

Bangladesh calls Indian envoy over 'unauthorised' border fencing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-calls-indian-envoy-over-unauthorised-border-fencing/articleshow/117182024.cms,"Photo/Agencies

DHAKA: Bangladesh's foreign affairs ministry summoned high commissioner Pranay Verma to send its message to New Delhi to advise all relevant authorities in India to refrain from any ""provocative actions"" that could escalate tensions along the shared border between the two countries.During the meeting at his office, foreign secretary Md Jashim Uddin conveyed Bangladesh's ""deep concern"" to Verma over the ""recent activities"" of the BSF, particularly the ""unauthorised"" attempt to construct barbed wire fencing at several places along the border and the related operational actions. These have caused tensions and disturbances along the border, he said.After the meeting that lasted over half an hour, high commissioner said, ""I just met the foreign secretary to discuss India's commitment to ensuring a crime-free border, effectively addressing challenges of smuggling, movement of criminals and trafficking. We have an understanding with regard to fencing the border for security. BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) have been in communication in this regard.""The foreign secretary, however, said construction of barbed wire fences without proper authorisation undermines the spirit of cooperation and friendly relations between the two neighbouring countries. He hoped that the BGB-BSF DG level talks in Feb would be able to discuss the matter at length.Meanwhile, Bangladesh's home affairs adviser Lt Gen (Retd.) Md. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury on Sunday claimed that India stopped the construction of barbed wire fences five places along the border following the ""strong stance"" taken by the BGB and local residents.He said it has been decided to issue a letter to cancel the ""unequal agreements"" on border fencing made during the previous Sheikh Hasina government.Foreign secretary Jashim Uddin, referring to the recent killing of a Bangladesh citizen at Sunamganj by BSF, expressed deep concern and disappointment over such repetition of border killings. He called for urgent action by Indian authorities to stop recurrence of such incidents and conduct enquiries into all these border killings and take actions against those responsible.He mentioned that it is also a matter of grave concern that despite repeated firm commitments from Indian authorities to pursue non-lethal strategy and stop killings such incidents of killing have been continuing.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs ministry summoned high commissioner Pranay Verma to send its message to New Delhi.

Poll Which Factor Is Key to Winning Elections? Clear Policy Agenda Strong Leadership

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday directed his target on opposition leaders Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray during a BJP state convention held in Maharashtra's Shirdi. Addressing party workers, Shah termed BJP's victory in the recent Maharashtra assembly polls the end of ""politics of betrayal.""""This victory in Maharashtra has several meanings. It has stopped the politics of betrayal started by Sharad Pawar in 1988. It has also shown Uddhav Thackeray—who betrayed us, abandoned the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray, and became chief minister—his place,"" Shah said.He added, ""People of Maharashtra showed that Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena is Balasaheb’s Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar’s faction is the real NCP.""Shah also pointed to the larger significance of the BJP’s victory, claiming it had shattered the confidence of the INDIA bloc in the wake of the Maharashtra election. ""The confidence of the INDIA alliance has been shattered after BJP’s historic win in Maharashtra. We will win the upcoming Delhi polls as well,"" he said.The Union minister reflected on the achievements of the BJP in 2024, saying, “The year 2024 has been historic for the BJP. In 2024, Modi ji became the prime minister for the third consecutive time. BJP won a third straight term in Haryana, the NDA emerged victorious for the first time in Andhra Pradesh, formed a full majority government in Odisha, and the NDA emerged victorious in Sikkim. Similarly, we have registered another victory in Maharashtra in 2024.”The state convention, attended by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and other BJP leaders, outlined the party’s strategy for upcoming local body elections. Fadnavis pointed out the party’s focus on unity and future planning. “All our leaders and party workers are here to align with our objectives. We will thank them for their efforts and provide clear directions for the road ahead,” he said.Meanwhile, the opposition bloc, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), appears to be facing cracks in its unity. Uddhav Thackeray, leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), recently announced that his faction would contest the upcoming local body elections independently, raising questions about the cohesion of the opposition alliance.The BJP-led Mahayuti government had secured a decisive victory in the November 2024 assembly elections, with the BJP emerging as the single largest party with 132 seats.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said no force can stop India from becoming a developed nation, thanks to its human capital in the form of youth power.Addressing the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue at Bharat Mandapam, Modi said he has blind faith on Swami Vivekananda and his belief on the country's youth, and urged them to take ownership of the nation's future, calling for active participation in shaping policies, fostering innovation, and considering politics as a platform for impactful action.Reiterating the goal of a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, Modi said, ""Those who merely crunch numbers may find it difficult, but my inner conviction, supported by your trust, tells me that while the goal is ambitious, it is not impossible. The determination of crores of youth is propelling the nation forward, and we will surely achieve our targets.""The dialogue, held on National Youth Day to mark Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary, aligns with the PM's vision to inspire one lakh youth with no prior political background to actively participate in the political arena.He also spoke about how shared goals drive progress. ""History teaches and inspires us. There are countless examples worldwide where a nation or community, united with a common goal, achieved incredible feats. In the 1930s, the US was mired in a severe economic crisis. People resolved to overcome it through the 'New Deal' and not only emerged from the crisis, but also accelerated their development. Singapore, once a small fishing village, became a global financial and trade hub through collective efforts and disciplined leadership,"" he said.'Sankalp se Siddhi (realisation through resolve)' emerged as a recurring theme, with Modi spotlighting milestones such as India's open-defecation-free status, universal banking access, and rapid development of a Covid-19 vaccine.While underscoring India's recent accomplishments in startups, manufacturing, sports and digital transformation, and attributing these to the energy and determination of young leaders, Modi said, ""In just a decade, you have brought India to the forefront of global progress."" He urged every citizen to take ownership of the journey to development. Stating that achieving the vision of a developed India by 2047 is not far off and it only requires daily targets, relentless pursuit, and collective effort, Modi said, ""When India achieves its goals, it will not only transform the nation but also inspire the world.""The PM also visited an exhibition on contributions from participants of the dialogue. He spent six hours engaging with 3,000 young leaders. Modi was also shown 10 presentations on topics like sustainable development, integrating technology in agriculture, and strategies for making India a manufacturing and startup hub. During the sessions, the PM offered suggestions, and encouraged the youth to pursue transformative ideas. In a unique gesture, he joined the young leaders for lunch, fostering informal yet meaningful discussions.","PM Narendra Modi said no force can stop India from becoming a developed nation.

India eyes mega defence deals worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore before March 31,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eyes-mega-defence-deals-worth-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-before-march-31/articleshow/117182178.cms,"The deals for fighters, submarines, choppers and artillery guns are part of long-term plan to boost firepower & combat capabilities of the forces

NEW DELHI: India plans to ink at least four mega defence deals for fighters, submarines, helicopters and artillery guns, collectively worth over Rs 1.5 lakh crore, before this fiscal ends on March 31, as part of the long-term plan to boost the firepower and combat capabilities of the armed forces.The first off the block will be the around Rs 63,000 crore contract with France for the direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighter jets, which will operate from the deck of indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, defence sources told TOI.The deal for the 22 single-seat maritime jets and four twin-seat trainers for the Navy, along with weapons, simulators, crew training and five-year performance-based logistics support as well as spares for the 36 Rafales already inducted by the IAF, is now headed for the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS), the sources added.Another major deal with France will be the Rs 38,000 crore one for three additional Scorpene diesel-electric submarines, with air-independent propulsion (AIP) for longer underwater endurance, to be built at the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL).The three new boats — with the first slated to roll out by 2031, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each — will add to the six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines already built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore ‘Project-75’. The sixth submarine ‘Vagsheer’ is slated to be commissioned, along with guided-missile destroyer Surat and stealth frigate Nilgiri, by PM Narendra Modi on Jan 15.“The Rafale deal is likely to be cleared by the CCS before this month ends, and will be followed by the Scorpene deal soon after,” a source said. Modi, incidentally, is slated to visit France for the Artificial Intelligence Summit on Feb 11 and 12.The other two mega deals are for 156 indigenous Prachand light combat helicopters for around Rs 53,000 crore and 307 indigenous advanced towed artillery gun systems (ATAGS) for Rs 8,500 crore.The 156 new Prachand helicopters (90 for Army, 66 IAF), which are capable of offensive operations in high-altitude areas like Siachen Glacier and eastern Ladakh, will be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. They will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and five Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract inked in 2022.The ATAGS designed and developed by DRDO, which is touted to have a strike range up to 48 km, in turn, will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems.With Bharat Forge emerging as the L-1 (lowest bidder), it will manufacture 60% of the guns, while Tata will produce the rest 40%. The order for 307 ATAGS is likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.“The aim is to sign all the four deals within this fiscal. Work is also underway to revise the Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020 to further cut down procurement timelines, streamline processes and provide a level playing field to all,” another source said.","India plans to ink at least four mega defence deals for fighters, submarines, helicopters and artillery guns, collectively worth over Rs 1.5 lakh crore.

"Groundwater recharge declined marginally in 2024, dip in water availability too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/groundwater-recharge-declined-marginally-in-2024-dip-in-water-availability-too/articleshow/117182060.cms,"Data shows that the annual groundwater recharge in 2024 was 446.9 billion cubic meter (BCM), compared to 449.08 BCM in 2023.

NEW DELHI: Total annual groundwater recharge in the country marginally declined in 2024, compared to 2023, and so did water availability due to higher groundwater extraction last year, with northwest India, including parts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh, being the bigger culprits.The Central Ground Water Board 's annual assessment report, released recently by the 'Jal Shakti' (water resources) ministry, also shows that the percentage of 'critical' and 'over-exploited' assessment units (block/taluk/tehsil/mandal), put together, increased in 2024, compared to the previous year, reflecting a bigger concern of inadequate recharge of groundwater in certain states, which extracted more for multiple use.The percentage of 'over-exploited' and 'critical' administrative units are more than 25% of the total units in the states and UTs of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Daman & Diu. It means groundwater extraction in these states and UTs substantially exceeded the annually replenishable groundwater recharge - a situation that might lead to water scarcity in due course if business-as-usual scenario remains.Data shows that the annual groundwater recharge in 2024 was 446.9 billion cubic meter (BCM), compared to 449.08 BCM in 2023. Accordingly, the annual extractable groundwater resources has also decreased marginally from 407.21 in 2023 to 406.19 BCM in 2024. In 2022, the total annual groundwater recharge was 437.6 BCM, whereas extractable groundwater resources was 398.08 BCM.Though the annual groundwater recharge and availability last year was much higher than 2022, the decline compared to 2023 is a concern, even as the year got good monsoon rainfall. The board has attributed it mainly to reduction in return flow from irrigation.The main source of replenishable groundwater resources is recharge from rainfall, which contributes to nearly 61% of the total annual groundwater recharge. Since over 75% of annual rainfall is received during the summer monsoon (June to Sept), the ministry's annual campaign 'Catch the Rain - Where it Falls When it Falls', by creating rainwater harvesting and conservation infrastructure through people's participation and states' cooperation, might show results in the long run. Though improvement in the groundwater situation is noticeable if it is compared with 2017, when the annual groundwater recharge was 431.86 BCM and the annual extractable groundwater resources 392.7 BCM, parts of northwest India invariably play spoilsport by indiscriminately extracting substantial amount of groundwater leading to over exploitation. Groundwater extraction for cultivating water-guzzling paddy in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh is one of the key reasons behind over exploitation in the region.""In some areas of the country, good continuous rainfall and management practices like groundwater augmentation and conservation measures taken up under central and state govt initiatives have resulted in improvement in the groundwater situation,"" said the report.Certain western parts of the country, particularly those of Rajasthan and Gujarat, also fall in the over-exploited zone, as groundwater recharge is limited due to the region's arid climate, leading to stress on the resource. On the other hand, groundwater availability is low due to characteristics of crystalline aquifers in southern part of peninsular India, including parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.","Annual groundwater recharge in 2024 was 446.9 billion cubic meter (BCM), compared to 449.08 BCM in 2023.

Deduct Rs 1.8 lakh from Rs 5.2 lakh granted as med expenses to claimant, orders HC

BENGALURU: The amount received by an accident victim under a mediclaim policy must be deducted from the total compensation under the head of medical expenses and hospitalisation charges , Karnataka HC has held based on Motor Vehicles Act Justice Hanchate Sanjeevkumar directed Oriental Insurance Company to pay Rs 4.93 lakh along with interest of 6 per cent a year to the family of S Hanumanthappa, a resident of Marathahalli in Bengaluru, after deducting Rs 1.8 lakh he had received from mediclaim. Hanumanthappa and his wife were travelling on a bike on Dec 10, 2008 when an autorickshaw dashed against them. He suffered fractures and was treated in various hospitals.He moved the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bengaluru. He claimed he was aged about 58 years, working as a teacher, and was drawing a salary of Rs 10,000 per month. On March 22, 2013, the tribunal awarded Rs 6.7 lakh, including Rs 5.2 lakh under the head of medical expenses.The insurer challenged the order, contending that Rs 5.2 lakh medical expenses was not correct, as Hanumanthappa got mediclaim reimbursements earlier.Justice Sanjeevkumar cited another Karnataka HC case in which the court had held that if the claimant got his medical expenses reimbursed, they can be deducted from accident compensation.“Therefore, in the present case, the amount received by the claimant under mediclaim is liable to be deducted from medical expenses while determining the compensation under the said head. The appellant (insurer) has produced evidence that the claimant received a mediclaim reimbursement amount of Rs 1.8 lakh. This fact is not disputed by the respondents/claimants,” the judge said. The HC ordered a deduction of Rs 1.8 lakh from Rs 5.2 lakh awarded as medical expenses to Hanumanthappa, determining the payout under this head at Rs 3.4 lakh.","S Hanumanthappa and his wife were travelling on a bike on Dec 10, 2008 when an autorickshaw dashed against them.

PRAYAGRAJ: As four crore devotees are expected to take a holy dip on Jan 13-14 to mark the beginning of Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, the entire mela area has turned into a fortress with the implementation of a seven-ring security plan for the safety of pilgrims.According to the estimates of the Mela authorities, at least 1 crore devotees are likely to flock to the Mela area on Paush Purnima (Jan 13) and three crore people will take holy dip on Makar Sankranti (Jan 14).The police on Sunday declared the entire Mela area a ‘no vehicle zone' and implemented a traffic diversion plan on all the seven routes leading to Sangam.Apart from a network of 2,751 CCTV cameras, including 328 AI-enabled cameras in Sangam as well as tent city, Mela police have also launched advanced AI-driven data analytics solution systems to enhance surveillance and crowd management.Additional director general (Prayagraj zone) Bhanu Bhaskar told TOI, ""We have implemented a robust seven-tier security circle, including Kumbh Mela (outer cordon, inner cordon and isolation cordon), district checking, neighbouring/buffer district, interstate checking, and security circle at city's prominent public places, including religious spots to ensure safety of visitors.""""To strengthen the inner and outer cordon, we have expanded infrastructure by setting up 13 more temporary police stations (total 57) and 15 additional checkpoints in both urban and rural areas. A dedicated team has been formed to oversee the implementation of advanced AI-driven data analytics solution systems. Maha Kumbh Police App has already been launched as part of our efforts to strengthen security and embrace smart policing,"" the ADG said.Mela police are taking assistance from AI-enabled solutions for real-time data analysis and seamless integration of multiple data sources.

Poll Will Genome Sequencing Data Impact Healthcare in India? No, It Will Take Time to Make a Difference Yes, It Offers Great Potential

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals and said it will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research .The Genome India Data , which represents the genetic diversity in the country, will be available to researchers at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) through managed access. ""I am confident this will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research,"" Modi said in a video-recorded statement played out at the Genomics Data Conclave organised by the Department of Biotechnology.Modi said this national database will facilitate advancements in the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases, foster the development of new medications and precision medical techniques, and enable research into the lifestyles and habits of diverse communities.A genome is the complete set of DNA sequences in an organism and contains all the instructions required for that organism to function, including embryogenesis, growth, responding to the environment, and healing from disease. The primary aim of Genome India is to construct a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations for India's population that will better capture our unique diversity. Launched in January 2020, its goal is to sequence 10,000 genomes from healthy Indian individuals spanning the length and breadth of the country.The Human Genome - the complete map of all 23 large DNA sequences (chromosomes) that encodes our species - comprises a total of around three billion base pairs contained within the nuclei of each of our cells.According to Martin Carkett and Alexander Honkala, experts in the field, while this sequence of base pairs is virtually identical in every human, differentiating us from, say, a chimpanzee or a mouse, there are nonetheless subtle differences in each of our individual genomes that make us unique. Whole-genome sequencing enables us to read a person's individual genome and, among other things, identify differences from the average human genome that are often associated with disorders and disease but can also be associated with other factors like disease resistance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals.

NEW DELHI: While the Indian government has invited Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to participate in the Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest, and an official announcement about his visit is expected any moment now, it would not like him to club his visit to India with a proposed visit by the president to Pakistan.Official sources have maintained for the past several weeks that Subianto will be the chief guest for the January 26 parade, but no official announcement has been made so far about the visit. Normally, the same announcement is made months in advance.Amid this delay in announcement, reports emerged in Pakistan media earlier this week that the president is likely to arrive in Islamabad on January 26 for a 3-day visit. India has encouraged foreign leaders in the recent past to not include Pakistan in their itinerary while travelling to India, and to dehyphenate their ties with the 2 countries.It is learnt that India has raised the issue diplomatically with Indonesia, hoping to dissuade Subianto from flying directly to Islamabad after the R-Day celebrations. The president hopping on a direct flight to Islamabad hours after the Indian military parade will be bad optics for India, given its troubled relationship with Pakistan over a range of issues, not least cross-border terrorism. Subianto had met the Pakistan PM, Shehbaz Sharif, in Egypt on the margins of a multilateral event in December and pledged to enhance economic cooperation between the two countries.With their common focus on political sovereignty, economic self- sufficiency and independent foreign policy, India and Indonesia have traditionally enjoyed strong ties. Indonesia has also emerged as India’s largest trading partner in the Asean region. During the state visit of then Indonesian President Joko Widodo in 2016, the two countries agreed to establish a Security Dialogue in order to develop a comprehensive action plan on security cooperation.Widodo was in India again in 2018 as one of the chief guests for the Republic Day parade, along with the leaders of 9 other Asean member-states.

""All four accused were detained, and they continue to remain in custody.""The next court appearance is a pretrial conference on February 11, and they will also appear in court on February 12.The statement comes after several media reports stated that the four individuals charged with the murder of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar have been released from custody.The reports cited documents filed by Canada's department of justice.The accused — Karan Brar, Karan Singh, Amandeep Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karanpreet Singh — were charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with Nijjar’s killing on June 18, 2023.Court documents show the status of the accused as “not in custody,” marked with an ""N."" The news of their release came days after former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation.The incident took place in the parking lot of a Gurdwara in British Columbia's Surrey, where Nijjar, who led the Khalistan Tiger Force , was fatally shot in what has been described as a ""contract killing.""A video of the incident, which reportedly surfaced in March 2024, showed armed men attacking Nijjar as he exited the Gurdwara.Nijjar’s killing has been at the center of strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada. Trudeau had alleged a possible involvement of Indian government agents in the murder, a claim India has consistently denied, calling it “absurd” and “motivated.”India has accused Canada of harbouring extremist and anti-India elements, including supporters of the Khalistan movement.Earlier, the ministry of external affairs stated that Canada had not provided any specific evidence or formal communication regarding the case, despite the arrests of Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder.The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) in British Columbia, which is handling the case, has accused the individuals of murder and conspiracy.

'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

MacKenzie Scott’s strategy: A shift toward repeat donations



MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has become one of the most prolific philanthropists in recent history. Over the past five years, Scott has donated an astounding $16 billion (approximately Rs 1,36,000 crore) to various charitable causes, placing her at the forefront of global philanthropy, as per reports. Through her Yield Giving initiative, Scott’s approach focuses on trust-based philanthropy, offering unrestricted grants to non-profits. While her efforts have drawn widespread praise, they have also sparked debates. Tech billionaire Elon Musk recently expressed his unease about Scott's donations, particularly regarding the issues they target and their potential long-term impact.MacKenzie Scott has reshaped philanthropy through her unconventional and expansive approach. Her Yield Giving initiative emphasizes trust-based grants, which provide non-profits the flexibility to allocate funds according to their needs. This model of unrestricted funding is a significant departure from traditional philanthropy, which often comes with stringent conditions.In 2024 alone, Scott introduced an open-call application process, inviting non-profits to apply for funding. Over 6,000 organizations submitted applications, and Scott ultimately awarded $640 million to more than 360 non-profits, exceeding her initial commitments. This innovative approach has been described as transformative, allowing organizations to address critical needs and achieve long-term goals.Despite Scott’s groundbreaking generosity, her donations have drawn criticism from certain quarters, including Elon Musk. Musk shared a social media post by entrepreneur John LeFevre that scrutinized Scott’s donations. The post argued that her contributions primarily benefit the ""NGO/non-profit complex"" and questioned whether they address the world's most pressing problems.Musk agreed with the post, expressing concern over Scott’s focus on causes such as racial equity, immigrant rights, and LGBTQ justice. He suggested that these efforts may inadvertently promote divisive ideologies rather than fostering unity or tackling urgent global issues.In 2024, Scott adopted a new strategy by making repeat donations to organizations she had previously supported. For example, CAMFED, an organization focused on girls’ education in Africa, received three additional grants, while Enterprise Community Partners, initially awarded $50 million in 2020, received an additional $65 million.This shift in strategy reflects Scott’s commitment to building long-term partnerships with non-profits and ensuring sustained impact. Her approach has been hailed as a game-changer by recipients, enabling organizations to plan effectively and achieve greater outcomes.","MacKenzie Scott is the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Maintaining composure even in adverse conditions, were forced to fire in self-defense and foiled the plan of forceful smuggling and drove all the smugglers back to Bangladesh. 572 bottles of Phensedyl, sharp-edged weapons and a high-beam torch were recovered from the spot.According to information received, on the night of 10/11 January, during the second shift duty at the border post Nawada, at about 0210 AM, the jawans saw the movement of 15-20 armed Bangladeshi smugglers in the Indian border area, who were rapidly moving towards the border fencing.Simultaneously, the presence of smugglers was also noticed on the Indian side of the barbed wire. The jawan present there immediately alerted his fellow jawans and ran towards the smugglers and challenged them. But the Bangladeshi smugglers ignored the challenge and started forcefully moving towards the fencing, flashing high beam torches in the eyes of the jawans.The jawans fired 2 blank rounds in the air to disperse the smugglers, but it had no effect on the smugglers. Instead, with the intention of disabling the jawans with the high beam light of the torch, they attacked them with sharp weapons and sticks.The jawans present somehow managed to save himself and fired 2 live rounds at intervals towards the smugglers in self-defense and to stop forcefully smuggling. By then other jawan nearby also reached the spot. Seeing the alertness of the BSF party and their reinforcement, the smugglers panicked and taking advantage of the darkness and the mango orchard, fled towards Bangladesh and India respectively.After a thorough search of the spot, 572 Phensedyls, 1 Dah and a torch were recovered from there. The possibility of any smuggler getting injured in the firing done in self-defense cannot be ruled out.Apart from this, in Murshidabad district, at the border outposts Nandanpur and Farjipara of the Sector headquarters Berhampur and in Malda district, at the border outposts Harinathpur and Churiyantpur of the Sector headquarters Malda, unsuccessful attempts of smuggling and infiltration were made by Bangladeshi smugglers and illegal intruders, where the jawans, in self-defense, fired stun grenades, PAG and other weapons on the cattle smugglers and illegal intruders, foiling the forceful attempts of smuggling and illegal infiltration, seized illegal drugs, 05 cattles and other illegal goods.The firing incidents and subsequent seizures have been reported to the respective police stations, and the confiscated items have been handed over to the concerned authorities.The spokesperson for the BSF South Bengal Frontier stated that such incidents are not uncommon during their duty. The BSF personnel continue to perform their duties with exceptional courage and vigilance. Despite regular flag meetings with the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) to address these forced infiltration and attack attempts by Bangladeshi criminals, no concrete actions have been taken by the BGB, emboldening the smugglers and criminals. Nevertheless, the BSF personnel remain steadfast in protecting the borders and ensuring the nation’s security under all circumstances.","The vigilant and courageous jawans posted at Border Outpost Nawada of 119th Battalion of BSF firmly faced the deadly attack. Maintaining composure even in adverse conditions, were forced to fire in self-defense and foiled the plan of forceful smuggling. 572 bottles of Phensedyl, sharp-edged weapons and a high- beam torch were recovered from the spot.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117144898,imgsize-1613009,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/117144898.jpg"

UK PM Keir Starmer is under pressure to sack Labour minister Tulip Siddiq, deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina ’s niece, after interim leader Muhammad Yunus condemned the use of properties allegedly gifted to her and her family in London by allies of the former regime.Siddiq is economic secretary to the treasury and her role involves tackling corruption in UK financial markets.Yunus toldhe wanted the properties investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), asserting that the assets bought by allies of Hasina’s Awami League should be returned to Bangladesh. “That’s the intention of the interim govt. How to bring them back,” Yunus told the paper.Siddiq (42) referred herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standards last Monday after media reports revealed that some London properties she lived in had been gifted by Awami League. “I have done nothing wrong,” she said in a letter to the authority.Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch on Sunday called for PM Starmer to sack Siddiq. “He appointed his personal friend as anti-corruption minister and she is herself accused of corruption,” Badenoch said. Starmer had said last week he had confidence in Siddiq.Yunus said it was an “irony” that Siddiq had been accused of corruption. “She becomes minister for anti-corruption and defends herself (over the properties)” he told the paper.revealed that an offshore company linked to two Bangladeshi businessmen had in 2005 gifted a Hampstead flat to Moin Ghani, a barrister who represented Hasina’s govt. Ghani gifted it to Siddiq’s sister Azmina in 2009 and Siddiq lived in it.Siddiq also owns a flat in King’s Cross which was given to her in 2004 by Abdul Motalif, who has connections to the Awami League. She rents this out and she continues to live in a £2.1-million (Rs 22cr) house rented from Abdul Karim Nazim, an executive member of UK Awami League. After Siddiq moved into his house, Hasina’s govt granted him VIP status.Siddiq’s mother Rehana was living in a £1.4 (Rs 15 crore) million London house owned by the family of Salman F Rahman, a wealthy Bangladesh tycoon who became a minister in Hasina’s govt.Yunus also referred to a report that found the elite had taken billions of pounds a year out of Bangladesh. “They pointed out how money is stolen, but it’s not stealing — when you steal, you hide it. It’s a robbery,” Yunus told the paper. Asked whether that applied to these properties, Yunus said: “Absolutely, it’s about plain robbery.”Mahfuz Alam, a student activist in Dhaka, alleged that giving property to members of the Hasina family overseas was “a co-ordinated process conducted for 15 years”. “They were plundering and assisting people who vouched for her (Hasina) and her politics,” Alam said.","UK PM Keir Starmer is under pressure to sack Labour minister Tulip Siddiq, deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina ’s niece.

Sam Altman’s sister accuses him of sexual abuse; family responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-family-responds/articleshow/117038723.cms,"Poll How Can Society Better Prevent Sexual Abuse? Stronger Legal Actions and Support More Education and Awareness

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statement

Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. We know many families facing similar struggles understand this well.

Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life.

Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this.

Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.

All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.

We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for.

Facebook HR head's leaked memo: We are making some changes to our hiring ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-hr-heads-leaked-memo-we-are-making-some-changes-to-our-hiring-/articleshow/117187792.cms,"On hiring, we will continue to source candidates from different backgrounds, but we will stop using the Diverse Slate Approach. This practice has always been subject to public debate and is currently being challenged. We believe there are other ways to build an industry-leading workforce and leverage teams made up of world-class people from all types of backgrounds to build products that work for everyone.



We previously ended representation goals for women and ethnic minorities. Having goals can create the impression that decisions are being made based on race or gender. While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.



We are sunsetting our supplier diversity efforts within our broader supplier strategy. This effort focused on sourcing from diverse-owned businesses; going forward, we will focus our efforts on supporting small and medium sized businesses that power much of our economy. Opportunities will continue to be available to all qualified suppliers, including those who were part of the supplier diversity program.



Instead of equity and inclusion training programs, we will build programs that focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.



We will no longer have a team focused on DEI. Maxine Williams is taking on a new role at Meta, focused on accessibility and engagement.



We serve everyone. We are committed to making our products accessible, beneficial and universally impactful for everyone.

We build the best teams with the most talented people. This means sourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender etc.). We will always evaluate people as individuals.

We drive consistency in employment practices to ensure fairness and objectivity for all. We do not provide preferential treatment, extra opportunities or unjustified credit to anyone based on protected characteristics nor will we devalue impact based on these characteristics.

We build connection and community. We support our employee communities, people who use our products, and those in the communities where we operate. Our employee community groups (MRGs) continue to be open to all.



Meta , the parent company of Facebook, is dismantling its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and dissolving its dedicated DEI team, according to an internal memo sent to employees on Friday. The changes include ending the company's Diverse Slate Approach in hiring and sunsetting supplier diversity programs.Janelle Gale , Meta's vice president of human resources, announced in the memo that the company would shift toward ""fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all."" The move comes amid what she described as a changing legal and policy landscape surrounding DEI efforts in the United States.Business Insider obtained the memo, which revealed that Maxine Williams, who previously led DEI efforts, will transition to a new role focused on accessibility and engagement.The social media giant had already discontinued its representation goals for women and ethnic minorities, citing concerns that such targets could create impressions of race or gender-based decision-making. The company will now focus its supplier strategy on supporting small and medium-sized businesses rather than diverse-owned enterprises.In defending the changes, Gale emphasized Meta's commitment to serving everyone through "" cognitively diverse teams "" while maintaining that no one should receive preferential treatment based on protected characteristics.The company will continue to support employee community groups, known as MRGs, which will remain open to all staff members.Read the full memo:Hi all,I wanted to share some changes we're making to our hiring, development and procurement practices. Before getting into the details, there is some important background to lay out:The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing. The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms longstanding principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics. The term ""DEI"" has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.At Meta, we have a principle of serving everyone. This can be achieved through cognitively diverse teams, with differences in knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Such teams are better at innovating, solving complex problems and identifying new opportunities which ultimately helps us deliver on our ambition to build products that serve everyone. On top of that, we've always believed that no-one should be given - or deprived of -opportunities because of protected characteristics, and that has not changed.Given the shifting legal and policy landscape, we're making the following changes:What remains the same are the principles we've used to guide our People practices:Meta has the privilege to serve billions of people every day. It's important to us that our products are accessible to all, and are useful in promoting economic growth and opportunity around the world.
