"Tiger burning brighter in Sundarbans, but villagers are smiling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tiger-burning-brighter-in-sundarbans-but-villagers-are-smiling/articleshow/110480158.cms,"KOLKATA: From man-eater to a resource option, the tigers in Indian Sundarbans seem to have undergone an image makeover over the past one decade as the big cats now provide alternative livelihood to hundreds of people on the delta in West Bengal.The forest villages in Sundarbans — a delta formed by the confluence of Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers in the Bay of Bengal — mostly fall under Joynagar Lok Sabha constituency which has over 8 lakh voters. As the Sundarbans is set for elections on Saturday, ecotourism guides and tour operators feel a slew of protourism measures such as opening more routes and entry points post elections will not only lead to a rise in footfall but also prevent incidents such as the killing of a guard inside the forest recently.A good number of villagers , who used to sneak into the woods on illegal fishing trips, now either steer tourism boats, act as nature guides or cook food on boats during photography tours of the mangroves in the delta.Four human deaths have been reported so far this year, in addition to over 10 last year, from the swampland due to tiger attacks. The figure was 21 in 2022. In all cases, victims had ventured into the core area where fishing is banned. The stats are official, actual figures may be higher.A 12km forest stretch under Sundarbans Tiger Reserve where human settlements are located just opposite got a fresh cover of nylon net fencing recently so that straying tigers won’t disrupt the poll process.In a terrain where humananimal conflict is on the rise, tiger tourism has come as a silver lining.Satadal Manna (name changed), who used to venture into the woods for crabs a couple of years ago, now cooks delicious food for tourists on boats.The stories of his family members getting into forest for livelihood never attracted 20-year-old Ananda Mondal (name changed), who got behind the wheels of a boat at just 13 years. He is now a trusted name in the mangroves tourism sector as far as sighting of wildlife is concerned.Asked if he had ever seen the elusive swamp tiger in the mangroves, he replied: “Can’t keep count.”A rise in annual tourist footfall — from about 1 lakh until 2012-13 to more than 2 lakhs now — keeps the boatmen and guides busy.Film crews, both national and international, have set their sights on Sundarbans.Soumyajit Nandy, a photographer, naturalist, and tour operator, said: “Sundarbans, on the Indian side (other on Bangladesh side), was never known for tiger sightings. Not even one was sighted in a month. Now multiple sightings take place in a month.”Nandy said opening more routes and multiple entry points would help villagers of more islands reap the benefits of tourism. The department can thus disperse the tourism pressure, which is concentrated now on a single zone in the reserve — the Sajnekhali eco-tourism zone, he said.“The activity is limited now to villages near the Sajnekhali tourism zone. If multiple entry points are opened in places like Basirhat, Kakdwip or Namkhana, more villagers can be brought under the ambit of tourism which will also result in less depen dency on forest,” he added.Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve director Nilanjan Mullick said: “The sightings show tiger numbers are stable in the Sundarbans. There are reports of tiger sightings al most every day now.”He said the situation has gradually changed with the increase in the number of tourists visiting the mangroves in the last few years.“Initially, the infrastructure wasn’t very good, but it has been developed in the last few years. Besides, management protocols have borne fruit and led to a rise in tiger population,” he said, adding that steps would also be taken in due course keeping an eye on tourist inflow.“Now, tiger sightings have increased and a pointer towards the fact is sighting of cubs. Steps, including opening of a few more routes that help serious wildlife tourism flourish, are welcome,” said naturalist and tour operator Nityananda Chowkidar.“With an increase in tourism activities, people have also stopped venturing into the forest to a large extent,” Chowkidar added.They need not. The returns are attractive. From a three-night, four-day photography tour (with five persons) costing Rs 85,000, an operator can make a profit of at least 15%-20%. If the operator owns a boat and homestay, it can go up to 25% after making payment to naturalists, cooks, boatmen and for forest permits.Political parties, particularly Trinamool Congress, have highlighted these issues during their poll campaigns. South 24 Parganas Zilla Parishad deputy speaker Animesh Mondal of Trinamool Congress said they have been highlighting the importance of homestays to boost wildlife tourism in the area.“We had approached the tourism department to open new homestays in the last financial year. We will do it again this year. Also, we are focusing on promoting birding hot spots in the buffer areas and near the villages,” Mondal said.Another guide said since tourists are considered additional eyes and ears of the forest, the department should take a pro-tourism approach as it can keep incidents such as the killing of the guard inside the forest at bay.","Four human deaths have been reported so far this year, in addition to over 10 last year, from the swampland due to tiger attacks.

Agnikul's single-stage tech demo rocket launch put on hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agnikuls-single-stage-tech-demo-rocket-launch-put-on-hold/articleshow/110479525.cms,"BENGALURU: Agnikul Cosmos, a spacetech startup, which hoped to make history with the inaugural test launch of its single-stage technology demonstrator rocket — a precursor for its Agnibaan launch vehicle — powered by a semi-cryogenic engine Agnilet, put the launch on ""hold” just minutes before lift off on Tuesday.

The company as of 6.12am was yet to officially call off the launch, but live coverage to the Agnibaan’s “SubOrbital Technological Demonstrator or SOrTeD” mission had been stopped. Teams are looking into anomalies that prompted the firm to put the launch on hold.

The IIT-incubated startup had, earlier this year, scheduled SOrTeD for an April 7 launch, but was forced to postpone due to technical glitches just 129 seconds before lift-off.

“Had to call off today’s launch attempt of Agnibaan SOrTeD just a second into Automated Launch Sequence (ALS) initiation because of a communication issue between two of our onboard hardware. Although it is frustrating to see a HOLD this close to lift off, we are glad that our ALS did its job,” the firm had said on the day.

Pune Porsche crash: 2 doctors arrested for changing blood sample of accused teen sent to police custody till May 30,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-porsche-crash-2-doctors-arrested-for-changing-blood-sample-of-accused-teen/articleshow/110450307.cms,"Govt forms three-member panel after arrest of two doctors of Sassoon Hospital

PUNE: Two doctors from Sassoon general hospital , arrested on Monday for destruction of evidence against the minor accused in Pune Porsche crash that killed two techies, were sent to police custody till May 30 by court.According to the police, the blood samples of the underage driver were discarded in a dustbin and substituted with samples from another individual, which showed no evidence of alcohol consumption. The arrested individuals have been identified as Dr Ajay Taware, the head of the Forensic Medicine department at the state-run hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer, and Atul Ghatkamble, a mortuary staffer working under Dr Taware. The court has remanded them in police custody until May 30.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI, ""We have arrested Taware and Halnor for changing the blood samples and manipulating the blood sample reports. We studied the entire procedure at the hospital and realised the manipulation. Our team then decided to arrest the two doctors"".“The minor’s first blood sample was collected at around 11 am on May 19 at Sassoon hospital (eight-and-a-half hours after the accident) and the second was collected at the Aundh-based hospital around 7pm, to rule out the possibility of any manipulation like replacement of blood samples. Both these samples were sent for DNA fingerprinting to FSL. The blood sample which was taken at Sassoon Hospital was thrown in a dustbin of the hospital and the blood sample of another person was taken and sent to the forensic lab. During the investigation, we found Srihari Halnor replaced this on the instructions of the HOD Forensic Medicine Department of Sassoon, Ajay Tawre. The DNA fingerprinting of the minor’s father was done at FSL after his arrest last Tuesday in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,” he said.The senior police official further said that as an abundant precaution, they had taken one more sample of the juvenile for DNA sampling and it was sent to another hospital.""The report of the other hospital revealed the juvenile's blood report at the Sassoon Hospital was manipulated as the DNA of (blood samples of) both the reports did not match,"" he said.Both the doctors did not have any idea that the police would take one more sample (of the accused juvenile), he said.""A probe is underway on whose blood samples were collected to replace with that of the juvenile's. We have recovered CCTV footages of the Sassoon Hospital and further probe is on,"" Kumar said.He also said that Indian Penal sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections have been added to the case in which the juvenile has been booked.""We have made the juvenile's father co-accused in the present case,"" he said.""The juvenile's father had called the doctor and offered him allurements to replace the blood samples,"" Commissioner Amitesh Kumar added.The accident, which occurred in the early morning of May 19, resulted in the deaths of two IT professionals when their motorcycle was struck by a speeding Porsche Taycan car at Kalyaninagar at 2.30 am, allegedly driven by the minor.The police have also obtained CCTV footage from one of the pubs visited by the boy, where he reportedly paid a bill amounting to Rs 48,000.The minor accused, who was taken to Sasoon Hospital for a medical examination, had his blood sample allegedly switched with another sample during the course of the investigation.According to the police, the teenager was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. It was later discovered that the minor's blood report was swapped with that of another individual who had not consumed alcohol.As the police awaited the blood sample reports, the manipulation came to light. To prevent any further tampering, the police had collected two samples from the boy. According to the Pune police commissioner, second blood sample indicated alcohol consumption by the teen accused.Initially, the Juvenile Justice Board granted bail to the teenager and instructed him to write an essay about road accidents. However, due to public outrage over the lenient treatment and a review application submitted by the police, the teenager was remanded to an observation home until June 5.Earlier, the Crime Branch unit arrested the grandfather of the minor accused on May 25 in connection with the accident. Pune city commissioner said that a separate FIR was filed against the grandfather under IPC sections 365 and 368.The driver, Gangadhar, filed a complaint with the police claiming that he was forcibly taken to the accused grandfather's residence on the night of May 19 while leaving the Yerawada Police Station.The accused grandfather and his father allegedly threatened Gangadhar, snatched his phone and forcibly kept him confined in their bungalow in an attempt to force him to take responsibility for the crime instead of his minor grandson.The Maharashtra government has set up a three-member committee in response to the arrest of two doctors and an employee from Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. The order appointing the committee was issued by Medical Education Commissioner Rajiv Nivatkar on Monday, with Dr Pallavi Sapale, dean of Grant Medical College and J J group of hospitals, serving as the chairperson.The committee also includes Dr Gajanan Chavan, a professor in the forensic medicine department at Grant Medical College, and Dr Sudhir Chowdhary, the Special Duty Officer at Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar Government Medical College and Super Speciality Hospital. The committee has been instructed to visit Pune on Tuesday to conduct their investigation.Pune commissioner has also instructed Dr Vinayak Kale, Dean of Sassoon General Hospital, to fully cooperate with the committee during the probe, as stated in the order.","Dr Ajay Taware, the head of the Forensic Medicine department at the state-run hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer, and Atul Ghatkamble, a mortuary staffer working under Dr Taware have been arrested.

'Unwell' CM Kejriwal seeks interim bail till June 9 for medical tests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unwell-cm-kejriwal-seeks-interim-bail-till-june-9-for-medical-tests/articleshow/110475566.cms,"Kejriwal: No time before polls end on June 1 to go for tests

NEW DELHI: With the deadline for him to return to Tihar Jail a week away, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday moved Supreme Court seeking extension of time to surrender till June 9 on the ground that he needed to undergo a comprehensive medical examination to identify whether his ""unusually high blood sugar level , rapid weight loss and bouts of dizziness, coupled with palpitation"", were life-threatening.Arrested by Enforcement Directorate on March 21 in a money laundering case relating to the alleged excise policy scam and released on interim bail by the apex court on May 10 for campaigning, the 54-year-old Kejriwal said a senior physician from Max Hospital clinically examined him on May 25 and suggested whole body PET-CT to rule out malignancies and Holter monitor test, both of which would take 5-7 days.Kejriwal said since elections in Punjab were scheduled for June 1, he would be busy campaigning till May 30, and would not be able to undergo these tests in a day. Assuring that he had and would scrupulously abide by the interim bail conditions, Kejriwal requested SC to extend his interim bail period by a week till June 9 to enable him to undergo the tests.The CM said he suffered from “an aggressive form of diabetes mellitus, which is very volatile and undergoes a wide range of swings in blood glucose, including episodes of high sugar, that is hyperglycemia, and low sugar, that is hypoglycemia”.He claimed that during his incarceration from March 21 till his release on May 10, the “negligent and callous behaviour of jail authorities” were partly responsible for his health-related complications, adding that during the period of custody, he suffered weight loss of around 6-7 kg, which he was not able to regain even after renewing his earlier lifestyle since his release from prison.The CM said he has also “started experiencing periodic episodes of giddiness, palpitation and overwhelming lethargy. In the meantime, recent test reports confirm that the appellant has also developed an unusually high blood glucose level as well as high ketone levels in urine, which indicate that in addition to increased blood sugar level, the appellant may have also developed kidney-related complications and kidney damage”.Kejriwal said if Delhi high court had not upheld his illegal and mala fide arrest, he would have had 60 days of campaigning time. Because of the supreme Court’s interim bail, he got 21 days to campaign, during which he campaigned in Delhi and across India, as a result, he had only time for health check-ups at home.The CM said his “present health complications and increased risk indicators warrant that these tests are carried out before his surrender, to avoid any aggravation during his further incarceration and any potential long-term damage to his health and life. Non-identification of the health issues at this stage, can have potentially very catastrophic consequences to his health and life”.Earlier on Monday, minister Atishi said Kejriwal had sought extension of his interim bail as he needed to undergo tests. “Kejriwal has filed for a seven-day extension of his interim bail. When he was in ED custody, judicial custody, he lost 7 kg of weight. This sudden weight loss is a matter of concern for doctors,” she said.“Despite being out of custody and under medical supervision, he has not been able to regain the weight again. Early tests have indicated that his ketone levels are extremely high. Unexplained sudden weight loss along with high ketone levels could be the indicator of some serious medical ailments, including damage to the kidneys, including cancer,” she said. “Therefore, doctors have suggested that he needs to have a series of investigations, including PET scans of his entire body, and other such serious tests,"" the minister said.","Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday moved Supreme Court seeking extension of time to surrender till June 9.

"For Kapadia, before her triumph at Cannes was trouble at FTII",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-kapadia-before-her-triumph-at-cannes-was-trouble-at-ftii/articleshow/110445350.cms,"Payal Kapadia wins big at Cannes; PM Modi praises the filmmaker, Javed Akhtar invites her for a meal

Nine years are all it took for FTII graduate Payal Kapadia to go from ""anti-national"" to toast of the nation. The young filmmaker , whose 'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday, was a student at the country's cradle of cinema and TV when she braved chants of ""go to Pakistan"" for participating in a 139-day protest in 2015 against the appointment of actor Gajendra Chauhan as the institute's chairperson.She, along with 34 other former students, continue to wage a legal battle over a case filed by the then institute's director, Prashant Pathrabe, alleging their involvement in gheraoing him and vandalising his office that year.But a day after conquering Cannes, there was not a trace of rancour in Payal's words. All she reflected was the afterglow of an unprecedented triumph that she gracefully shared with fellow filmmakers from India.""It's a great feeling to receive this prize because there are so many good films from India alongside ours, and we feel a part of the larger family of filmmakers. We have three films from FTII directors this time. My FTII batchmate Maisam Ali's film 'In Retreat' is the first Indian entry to Cannes' ACID sidebar (Association for the Diffusion of Independent Cinema),"" she told TOI from the French Riviera.Payal’s film on 2015 FTII stir had also won Cannes laurelAlso, an FTII student’s (Chidananda Naik) film, titled ‘Sunflowers Were the First to Know’, won the main prize in La Cinef section. It’s fantastic for us and FTII.” Payal’s batchmates and other alumni recall that the 2015 protest was “against the appointment of people who had no achievement in filmmaking” but were allegedly included in FTII’s governing council for political reasons.Harishankar Nachimuthu, ex-president of FTII Students’ Association and spearhead of the agitation, said Payal always had a vision about where she wanted to go and was willing to fight it out. “She was denied a scholarship and a foreign exchange opportunity for participating in the four-month protest. But even she would agree that FTII made us better filmmakers, better human beings, and responsible citizens,” he said.Payal credited her teachers and students at FTII for her success, saying that while not everyone needed to go to a film school, the institute benefited her with a structure that facilitates the dissemination of different cinematic ideas. “It is also a great place to meet people who share a love for cinema. My batchmates were instrumental in shaping my ideas. At FTII, we got to see films from all over the world and this exposure helped me make my film.”Payal’s peers and seniors see her as a film aficionado perpetually behind the camera, documenting various subjects, and relentlessly pursuing any project she takes up to fruition.Ajayan Adat, winner of the 53rd Kerala State Film Awards for best sound design, was Payal’s senior by two years in college. He said her big qualities were patience and diligence. “She was pained by the then govt’s attitude against the students’ protest. So she took out a camera and started filming everything. She made hours of footage into a documentary titled ‘Night of Knowing Nothing’. It won the L’Oeil d’Or at Cannes in 2021.”","'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday.

2 convicted of murder even in absence of victim's body,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-convicted-of-murder-even-in-absence-of-victims-body/articleshow/110475505.cms,"MUMBAI: Over six years after 28-year-old BBlunt salon executive Kirti Vyas went missing, a sessions court on Monday held two of her colleagues - Siddhesh Tamhankar and Kavita Sidhwani (name changed), in whose company she was last seen - guilty of her murder, making it a rare conviction in the absence of the victim's body .Special judge MG Deshpande said, ""The offence against both of you has been proved."" The judge will pronounce the quantum of sentence on Tuesday. While the maximum punishment is death, the minimum is life imprisonment. The trial was conducted in-camera at the behest of Sidhwani's lawyer to protect her identity.Vyas went missing on March 16, 2018, after leaving home for work. Tamhankar and Sidhwani were arrested on May 5 that year. A police inquiry found that the two strangled her in a car and dumped her body at Mahul. A prolonged search for the body did not yield results.The prosecution had said in court that Tamhankar had been afraid of losing his job after being put on notice by Vyas over his poor performance at work, and of his relationship with a married Sidhwani being exposed.Sidhwani (48), who had been granted bail by Supreme Court in 2021, broke down after the verdict and was taken into custody. Tamhankar (42), who has been in jail since his arrest in 2018, made repeated attempts to calm her down.IPS officer Sanjay Saxena, who was the then JCP (crime), credited the verdict despite the absence of the body to good teamwork. ""Strong circumstantial evidence coupled with scientific evidence through forensic analysis, was the key,"" he said.Calling the crime premeditated, special public prosecutor Avdhoot Chimalkar had cited the evidence of 39 witnesses to seek a conviction, and said, while submitting the final arguments in the case, that the crime was committed on the day the deadline mentioned on the show-cause notice ended, ""on which day, in all probability, his services were to be terminated"". He said Tamhankar and Sidhwani's residences, and their workplace, were far from Vyas's home and there was no other need for them to have waited for her outside her house on March 16, 2018.The prosecution said Tamhankar had accompanied Vyas's family when filing a missing person complaint and even joined a search for her. It said during none of these instances did Tamhankar reveal he and Sidhwani had picked Vyas up from outside her house - the most incriminating evidence against him. He revealed this out of fear only after CCTV footage was being scanned. It was also said DNA from the bloodstains and hair strands recovered from the car matched with Vyas' blood samples.","Kirti Vyas went missing on March 16, 2018, after leaving home for work.

Adani’s Mundra Port welcomes largest ever container ship to dock in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adanis-mundra-port-welcomes-largest-ever-container-ship-to-dock-in-india/articleshow/110443007.cms,"NEW DELHI: Adani Group ’s Mundra Port on Sunday saw the largest ever container ship to dock at an Indian port when the almost 400-metre-long MSC Anna came visiting. This vessel is a metre longer than the earlier biggest one — MV MSC Hamburg — that docked here last July.

“MSC Anna is an impressive vessel, boasting an overall length of 399.98 m (roughly the length of four football fields) and a staggering capacity of 19,200 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), which makes it the largest container ship by capacity to ever visit an Indian port. Its arrival draft is 16.3 m, which can be accommodated only at Adani Ports, Mundra, as no other port in India is capable of berthing a deep-draft vessel. During its stay, the expected exchange is 12,500 TEUs,” Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said in a statement.

Last July 2023, Adani Ports, Mundra, had berthed the 399-metre-long MV MSC Hamburg, one of the longest container ships in the world, with a capacity of 16,652 TEUs. This had set the stage for the arrival of MSC Anna.

“The arrival of MSC Anna at Mundra not only highlights the port’s capacity to handle mega ships but also reflects its role in enhancing India’s maritime trade capabilities. As APSEZ continues to expand and upgrade its facilities, the port is set to play an increasingly significant role in the global shipping and logistics landscape,” the statement added.

"Monsoon to be above normal but no respite from heat yet, northwest India to see more heatwave days in June: IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-respite-yet-north-india-to-see-more-heatwave-days-imd/articleshow/110476171.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sticking to its April forecast, India Meteorological Department Monday predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall across the country in general, and over the monsoon core zone (which depends on rain-fed agriculture) in particular, during the June-Sept rainy season, giving a positive signal to the economy . There is a forecast probability of 61% for the country to get 'above normal' monsoon rainfall.However, most parts of northwest India will not get respite from the scorching heat in June even as there is a brief relief after three days due to western disturbances with IMD expecting a minimum four to six days of heatwave in the region next month. Many other parts of the country too will face normal to above normal maximum and minimum temperatures during the month.It may happen despite the normal onset of monsoon over Kerala as the possibility of its subsequent subdued progress, specifically towards northwest India, cannot be ruled out. The possibility of a rare phenomenon of the monsoon arriving in northeast India first before it hits Kerala is also not ruled out. IMD said conditions are likely to become favourable for monsoon onset over Kerala during next five days - it means monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to happen either on its normal date of arrival (June 1) or a day before.“Quantitatively, the southwest (summer) monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106% of the long period average (LPA) with a model error of ± 4%,"" said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra while releasing the second stage of long range monsoon forecast reflecting its spatial distribution.Accordingly, central India and south Peninsular India are most likely to get ‘above normal’ rainfall whereas northwest India may get ‘normal’ rainfall. There is, however, a concern for northeast India and eastern part of central India, including large parts of Odisha and certain parts of south West Bengal and Jharkhand, where there is a forecast of ‘below normal’ rainfall.“But the good news is that the monsoon core zone, consisting of most of the rainfed agriculture areas in the country, is most likely to get ‘above normal’ (>106% of LPA) rainfall. It’ll boost farming operations in the region,” said Mohapatra.Since good farming operations depend on fairly good distribution of rainfall across regions, the prediction of ‘above normal’ rainfall in the monsoon core zone that lacks adequate irrigation networks may not just boost the Kharif (summer sown) crops in summer but also contribute to enough moisture in the soil for good farming operation for Rabi (winter sown) crops. It’ll lead to high output of foodgrains, pushing rural demand and the overall economy during 2024-25.Though northwestern and central parts of India are likely to get some relief from the scorching heat after three days due to a western disturbance and moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea, a higher number of heatwave days are predicted in the region in June.“Normally, northwest India and the adjoining areas record two-three heatwave days in June. But this time, we expect four-six days of heatwave in this region,” said Mohapatra.",There is a forecast probability of 61% for the country to get 'above normal' monsoon rainfall. Most parts of northwest India will not get respite from the scorching heat in June. The possibility of a rare phenomenon of the monsoon arriving in northeast India first before it hits Kerala is also not ruled out.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110476356,imgsize-313133,width-400,resizemode-4/110476356.jpg"

Among the states/UTs where NIA carried out the searches were Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh. Eight fresh FIRs were registered and five accused - Manish Hingu of Vadodara, Pahlad Singh of Gopalganj, Nabialam Ray of south west Delhi, Balwant Kataria of Gurgaon, and Sartaj Singh of Chandigarh - arrested.

Youths lured with false job promises were being forced to work in fake call centres at Laos, Golden Triangle SEZ and Cambodia, among other places, as part of the racket, controlled and operated mainly by foreigners. They were coerced into undertaking illegal activities online, such as credit card fraud, investments in cryptocurrency using fake applications, honey trapping etc.

Investigations further revealed the arrested accused were coordinating with traffickers operating from across the international border to facilitate illegal border-crossing of Indian youth from Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to Laos SEZ. They were working at the behest of foreign-based agents belonging to well organised syndicates that were active in several districts of Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Gujrat, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana etc.

The searches led to the seizure of several incriminating materials including documents, digital devices, handwritten registers, multiple passports, bogus overseas employment letters etc, said NIA.

Mobius, a renowned investor, shared his insights on the potential returns from the Indian stock market over the next three to five years in an interview with ET Now.When asked about his expectations, Mobius stated, ""Over the longer term, I believe you are talking about 14-15% returns for India."" He explained that as a general rule of thumb, one can double the GDP growth rate of the market to estimate stock market returns. With India's real GDP growth at 7-8%, Mobius projects the stock market to deliver returns of 14-15-16% in the future.Regarding the recent record highs achieved by Indian markets, such as the Sensex surpassing 75,000 points, Mobius was questioned about his earlier prediction of the Sensex hitting the one lakh mark.Also Read | Repeat of 2004 shock defeat for NDA appears unlikely, says Jefferies' Chris Wood; cautions on capital gains tax changes When asked if he expects this milestone to be reached within the next 12 to 18 months, Mobius said, ""I would not say the next 18 months, but as I mentioned when I first made that prediction, within the next few years.""Mobius also noted that the global markets , including the US, have been performing well, and the Indian market has been keeping pace. In some months, India outperforms the US, while in others, the US takes the lead, he said.Mobius is of the view that there is still significant potential for growth in the global market, and the increasing interest in equities worldwide, especially in the US, is benefiting India as well. As investors in the US make substantial profits, they seek to diversify their portfolios globally, and India has become one of the most attractive destinations for investment, he added.Also Read | 'On June 4, markets will...': PM Modi's big prediction for Sensex on Lok Sabha election results day Despite the strong performance of the Indian market, there has been a notable outflow of foreign institutional investors (FIIs), with a year-to-date selloff figure of $3.3 billion.Mobius says that this can be attributed, in part, to hedge fund activity. However, it is essential not to focus too heavily on these short-term movements, he said.“At the end of the day, you are going to be getting a lot of long-term money, not only in the equity market, not only in the fixed income market, but in direct investment in manufacturing and distribution and other areas. India is a huge market and there are lots of opportunities for global investors.They are going to take advantage of that opportunity,” he said.","Mark Mobius, Chairman, Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund believes that Indian markets will deliver 14-15% returns over the longer term.

"Silver outshines gold, but pace lags in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-outshines-gold-but-pace-lags-in-india/articleshow/110479108.cms,"MUMBAI: Silver has outperformed gold in domestic and international markets by a margin of around 10 percentage points over a year. However, returns from silver in the domestic market are lagging the international ones even as the rupee has weakened, while returns on gold are nearly identical in domestic and international markets.Silver prices rose nearly 33 per cent in a year, while gold rates increased by 21 per cent in international markets. In India, silver returns stood at just over 29 per cent against gold's nearly 20 per cent.The difference in returns in silver emerged as Indian importers are using the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement route - a bilateral trade channel between India and the UAE that allows lower duties. Compared to the standard 15 per cent import duty on gold and silver, CEPA allows 6-8 per cent lower duty on silver, analysts said.Lower landing costs and the expectation of a strong rally in silver prices had led to huge imports of the metal in the last 4-5 months. This had caused some supply overhang, resulting in lower price of silver in India compared to the international market. This has opened an arbitrage opportunity in silver between Indian and international prices, market players said.Taking advantage of the CEPA, ""in the last four months, silver imports to India were in abundance... about 2,000 tones"", said Navneet Damani, senior VP (commodity research), Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""The market was flooded with imported silver.""The stronger rally in silver was due to two reasons: its industrial use as well as in the jewellery segments. ""Silver is used in the solar industry, EV, hydropower and also in the 5G telecom towers and equipment,"" Damani said. All these use-cases are leading to higher demand for the white metal, while global production is still in deficit mode, he said.Damani expects silver to outperform gold over the next couple of years. He anticipates that its price could breach the Rs 1-lakh-per-kg mark by year-end from about Rs 90,000 level now.","Silver prices rose nearly 33% in a year, while gold rates increased by 21%.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi has expressed ""shock and surprise"" over opposition netas getting endorsements from Pakistan, saying such a trend was a ""serious issue"" and a matter of ""thorough investigation "". In an interview with news agency IANS, he said, ""I am not aware why certain people are liked by those who harbour animosity towards us.""PM was responding to a question about Fawad Chaudhry , Pakistani ex-minister, expressing support for Arvind Kejriwal. Chaudhry had earlier expressed admiration for Rahul Gandhi.On May 25, Pakistan’s Fawad Chaudhry posted a message for Kejriwal, while replying to his X post, “May peace and harmony defeat forces of hate and extremism”. Kejriwal had swiftly distanced himself from the endorsement from across the border with a post on X, saying Indians were capable of sorting out their issues.On May 1, Chaudhry had written on X, “Rahul on fire”, while tagging a video where the Wayanad MP was criticising BJP, particularly targeting Modi. This drew sharp reactions from BJP. The party called it an obvious case of “Congress’s dalliance with Pakistan”.Modi also said Taj Mahal was not the only tourism destination in the country that foreigners should visit, adding that other serene and picturesque locales were waiting to be explored. “Just by visiting Taj Mahal, you can’t think you have seen the whole of Bharat. There is huge potential in the country and there are multiple destinations to explore,” he added.The PM said his govt succeeded in its efforts to create a new image and brand of Bharat and make global powers “curious” about India and its diversity with a series of G20 summits across the country.Modi said the UPI facility played a significant role in India’s fight against Covid-19, even as several prosperous countries faced problems. “If there was no UPI, can someone tell me how we would have fought Covid? Even rich countries could not provide money to their people despite having sufficient funds. We gave it easily to the needy,” Modi said.“Today, we can send money to 11 crore farmers within 30 seconds. Now, UPI is user-friendly because of talented youth who create such world-class products that any common person can use,” he added.","PM was responding to a question about Pakistani ex-minister, expressing support for Arvind Kejriwal.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

CHICAGO/LONDON: The United States and Europe are taking steps to acquire or manufacture H5N1 bird flu vaccines that could be used to protect at-risk poultry and dairy workers, veterinarians and lab technicians, government officials said, moves influenza experts say could curb the threat of a pandemic.U.S officials last week said they were moving bulk vaccine from CSL Seqirus that closely matches the current virus into finished shots that could provide 4.8 million doses of vaccine. European health officials told Reuters they were in talks to acquire CSL's prepandemic vaccine.Canadian health officials said they have met with GSK, maker of Canada's seasonal flu shots, to discuss acquiring and manufacturing a prepandemic bird flu vaccine once its seasonal flu production capacity is freed up.Other countries, including the UK, are discussing how to proceed on prepandemic vaccines, scientists said.The actions follow the explosive spread of a new strain of bird flu that emerged in late 2020 and has caused unprecedented numbers of deaths among wild birds and domestic poultry and has begun infecting many mammal species.In March, US officials reported the first outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle, which has infected dozens of herds in nine states and two dairy workers. The US Food and Drug Administration has estimated that 20% of the US milk supply shows signs of the virus, indicating a wider spread is likely.Human exposures to the virus in poultry and dairy operations could increase the risk that the virus will mutate and gain the ability to spread easily in people.""All of our efforts need to be focused on preventing those events from happening,"" said Matthew Miller, co-director of the Canadian Pandemic Preparedness Hub at McMaster University. ""Once we have widespread infections of humans, we're in big trouble.""Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan, said she has been in discussions with US and Canadian officials about using vaccines to protect workers following the virus' spread into new mammal species.Dawn O'Connell of the US Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said the government is ""looking closely"" at the possibility of vaccinating farm workers and others in close contact with the virus.The US has contracts with CSL and GSK to test prepandemic vaccines that more closely match the circulating virus than older H5N1 vaccines in the stockpile. The US is moving forward with the CSL vaccine, a Department of Health and Human Services official confirmed.Discussions about prepandemic vaccine use are going on at government levels and among scientists in a number of places, including in the UK, said Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at University College London, who also researches avian flu for the UK Health Security Agency.If deployed strategically to dairy farmers, healthcare workers and those in close contact with infected animals, ""it would put a pin in the virus,"" she said, although she said it was not clear if this step was necessary yet.The UK government did not comment but said it is monitoring the situation in the USIn Europe, the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority is working on a joint procurement of CSL Seqirus's vaccine to ""potentially prevent a pandemic"" sparked by individuals exposed to infected birds and animals, spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker told Reuters.A spokeswoman for CSL, which has contracts for pandemic influenza vaccines with 30 governments, said the company has been in talks with several governments about procuring vaccines since 2022. Those requests have accelerated with the US outbreak, she said.The US maintains a stockpile of prepandemic vaccine candidates and bulk vaccine against an array of influenza strains and conducts clinical trials to support an Emergency Use Authorization or FDA license in the event of pandemic.Seasonal flu vaccine makers, including Sanofi, could also be asked to shift to producing pandemic flu vaccines.The US is in talks with mRNA vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna about potential pandemic vaccines.Dr. Richard Webby, a St. Jude Children's Research Hospital virologist who studies flu in animals and birds for the World Health Organization, said the situation in dairy cattle merits vaccine use.""If we look at the exposure levels that some of these farmers are getting, it's high,"" Webby said.The decision on how and when to use the vaccine will hinge on evidence of increased transmission, severity of disease, cases in people with no link to a dairy farm and mutations in the virus, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said.Dutch flu virologist Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, who has conducted experiments mapping the changes necessary for bird flu to spark a pandemic, said Europe's plan is to procure the CSL vaccine for people occupationally exposed to the virus.His lab could well be eligible if a vaccine becomes available, he said, adding, ""I would certainly take it.""","The U.S. and Europe are taking steps to acquire or manufacture H5N1 bird flu vaccines. The vaccines could be used to protect poultry and dairy workers, veterinarians and lab technicians. The actions follow the explosive spread of a new strain of bird flu that emerged in late 2020.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110454335,imgsize-28024,width-400,resizemode-4/110454335.jpg"

Musk has posted about Biden on X at least seven times a month since Jan, attacking the prez for everything from his age to his policies on immigration and health. Before that, he posted about Biden twice in Dec and not at all in Nov, according to an NYT analysis. In all, Musk had posted nearly 40 times about Biden this year, compared with about 30 times for all of last year.In contrast, Musk had posted more than 20 times on X this year about former prez Donald Trump . In those posts, Musk defended Trump, arguing that he is a victim of media and prosecutorial bias in the criminal cases that the former prez faces.Musk's posts about the prez race stand out because he is signalling a willingness to tip the political scales as the owner of an influential social media platform, something that no other head of a social media firm has done. And Musk exerts outsize influence over the political discourse on X, where he regularly posts to his 184 million followers. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's founder, has shied away from endorsing candidates and rarely posts political content on Facebook or Instagram.

"Revealed: Cult-like dynamics in Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow's death penalty trial",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/revealed-cult-like-dynamics-in-chad-daybell-lori-vallows-death-penalty-trial/articleshow/110469316.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two contrasting versions of Chad Daybell are being presented at his death penalty trial : a religious leader who masterminded the murders of his wife and his lover’s children, and a submissive man manipulated by the women around him.Prosecutors argue that Daybell’s “desire for sex, money, and power” led to the killings of his first wife Tammy, 49, and his current wife Lori Vallow ’s children, Tylee Ryan, 16, and JJ Vallow, 7. The defense, however, paints Daybell as a man under Vallow’s control, describing her as a “very sexual” woman who lured him into her schemes, a report in the Independent said.The trial, taking place in Boise, Idaho, has horrified the nation not only due to the brutality of the murders but also because of the couple’s extreme beliefs. Daybell and Vallow believed they were on a religious mission to lead “the 144,000” followers, with Daybell as a prophet and Vallow as a goddess.Vallow, who married Daybell two weeks after his wife’s mysterious death, was convicted last year for the murders and sentenced to life in prison. Daybell’s trial, now wrapping up, centers on the question: who was in charge? Gender dynamics within their religious beliefs play a significant role in this question.Author Leah Sottile described the defense’s strategy of deflecting blame to Vallow as “misogynistic,” attempting to portray Daybell as overtaken by a “Jezebel figure.” This narrative contrasts with the patriarchal teachings of their Mormon faith, which traditionally positions men as presiding authorities over their families, the Independent report said.Family and friends testified that Vallow’s beliefs became more extreme after meeting Daybell at a religious conference in 2018, leading to increasingly dangerous ideologies involving zombies, dark spirits, and death.Daybell’s daughter Emma defended her father’s actions, saying that his demeanor at his wife’s funeral was typical for a grieving Latter-day Saint husband. Julie Coulter Bellon, a former author with Daybell’s publishing company, also described him as quiet but intense, involved in all major decisions at the company.The trial, marked by graphic testimonies and emotional family accounts, is set to conclude soon. If convicted, Chad Daybell faces the death penalty or life in prison.","Chad Daybell faces the death penalty or life in prison for the murders of his wife and his lover's children.

Pakistan to revive China Belt and Road initiative projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-revive-china-belt-and-road-initiative-projects/articleshow/110470413.cms,"Pakistan ’s new government is hoping to inject some fresh momentum into projects that fall under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it tries to boost the country’s troubled economy.The South Asian nation is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects , agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan, said Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s federal minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, who also co-heads the committee responsible for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , in an interview.“Yeah, I’m very hopeful because I was there in China recently and I had meetings with their senior leadership,” said Iqbal at his office in Islamabad, decorated with a large map showcasing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “So I see great interest on the Chinese side to revive the momentum for CPEC and also to take it into the second phase.”Pakistan was seen as a flagship destination for BRI projects , with CPEC — which includes a port in the southern town of Gwadar and new power plants — the crown jewel. The progress on new projects stalled in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid Pakistan’s on-going economic difficulties that have required the International Monetary Fund’s intervention.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in February, has been looking to revive economic cooperation with China for the past two years. Sharif’s older brother, Nawaz, led the country when Pakistan signed on to the BRI in 2013.Projects worth about $25 billion came online in the first phase, including power plants that ended the nation’s chronic power deficit.A Pakistani committee approved a long-delayed railway upgrade project last week — but scaled it down from $10 billion to $6.8 billion.The project will be done in two phases “so there is not a big burden on Pakistan,” said Iqbal. The railway, in its first phase will run from Karachi, the southern coast city, to Multan, a little over halfway to the capital, Islamabad.The Sharif government has also finished some key BRI projects that were pending for years: a water-supply project in Gwadar, dredging work at the port and an electricity transmission line from Iran.“So all these things really help China see that the new government is again serious and it restored their confidence that now Pakistan is, you know, serious about CPEC initiatives ,” said Iqbal.China has also been a key financial lender, alongside the IMF, with its loans helping Pakistan avoid bankruptcy. The country is struggling with low growth and the fastest rising consumer prices in Asia. Islamabad’s difficulties have seen it fall behind on payments related to Chinese-funded power plants.To mark the tenth anniversary of CPEC last year, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng unveiled five new corridors including one focused on growth to boost economic activity in Pakistan. The others are related to livelihood, innovation, green energy and regional connectivity. Sharif is likely to visit China soon, said Iqbal.One change in the second phase would likely involve Islamabad taking a step back while urging the private sector to forge partnerships with Chinese firms.The other big focus, albeit a long-shot prospect, is to try and attract Chinese firms thinking of relocating from China amid rising labor costs and heightening geopolitical tensions.“That would be a success because at the moment more than 80 million jobs are being relocated from China to other countries because of the high level cost in China,” said Iqbal. “They have gone to Vietnam and you know, Laos and Cambodia. There is now overcrowding there. So they are certainly looking for new places.”","Pakistan is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects, agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan.

PATUAKHALI: Tens of thousands of Bangladeshis left their coastal villages Sunday for concrete storm shelters further inland as the low-lying nation prepared for the expected landfall of an intense cyclone , officials said.Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening, with Bangladesh 's weather department predicting crashing waves and howling gales with gusts of up to 130 kilometres (81 miles) per hour.Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its low-lying, densely populated coast have increased sharply from one a year to as many as three due to the impact of climate change .""The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four metres) above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous,"" senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik told AFP.Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level, warning fishermen against going to the sea and triggering an evacuation order for those in at-risk areas.As people fled, police said that a heavily laden ferry carrying more than 50 passengers double its capacity was swamped by rough waters and sank near Mongla, a port in the expected path of the storm.""At least 13 people were injured and were taken to a hospital,"" local police chief Mushfiqur Rahman Tushar told AFP, adding that other boats plucked the passengers to safety.""Our plan is to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from unsafe and vulnerable homes to the cyclone shelters ,"" the government's disaster management secretary Kamrul Hasan told AFP.The authorities have mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers to alert people to the danger.He said some 4,000 cyclone shelters have been readied along the country's lengthy coast on the Bay of Bengal, with the cyclone expected to hit a 220-kilometre stretch from India's Sagar Island to Khepupara in Bangladesh.The state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department said Cyclone Remal would make landfall Sunday between 6:00 pm and midnight (1200-1800 GMT).In addition to the villagers and fishermen, many of the multi-storey centres have space to shelter their cattle, buffaloes and goats, as well as their pets.""Some 78,000 volunteers have been mobilised to alert coastal people and evacuate the vulnerable people,"" Hasan said.Helal Mahmud Sharif, the chief government administrator of Khulna province, told AFP some 20,000 people had been evacuated to shelters in the most vulnerable coastal regions.Another 15,000 people and about 400 domesticated animals have been evacuated in the coastal Patuakhali and Bhola districts.On the low-lying Bhashan Char island, which is home to 36,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, 57 cyclone centres have been readied, deputy refugee commissioner Mohammad Rafiqul Haque told AFP.The country's three seaports and the airport in the second-largest city Chittagong were closed, officials said.India's Kolkata airport closed from noon Sunday until Monday morning ""predicted heavy winds and heavy to very heavy rainfall"", airport authorities said, while beaches near the area have been ordered shut.While scientists say climate change is fuelling more storms, better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced the death toll.In the Great Bhola Cyclone in November 1970 an estimated half a million people died -- mostly drowned by the storm surge.In May last year, Cyclone Mocha became the most powerful storm to hit Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr in November 2007.Sidr killed more than 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage.Last October, at least two people were killed and nearly 300,000 fled their homes for storm shelters when Cyclone Hamoon hit the country's southeastern coast.","Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening.
