'Government remains open to ...': What Canada's trade minister said on economic ties amid diplomatic fallout with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-remains-open-to-what-canadas-trade-minister-said-on-economic-ties-amid-diplomatic-fallout-with-india/articleshow/114269327.cms,"Canadian trade minister Mary Ng said that her government was committed to maintaining robust commercial ties with India in the wake of a significant diplomatic rift between India and Canada .""I want to reassure our business community that our government remains fully committed to supporting the well-established commercial ties between Canada and India,"" Ng said on Tuesday.Ng, who oversees export promotion, international trade, and economic development, highlighted the ongoing support of Canada’s Trade Commissioner Service, which will continue to assist Canadian companies operating in India.“Let me be clear: Canada stands firmly by its businesses. We will work closely with all Canadian enterprises engaged with India to ensure these important economic connections remain strong,” she said.However, she also pointed out the need to balance economic interests with the protection of Canadians and adherence to the rule of law. “We will not tolerate any foreign government threatening, extorting, or harming Canadian citizens on our soil. We urge the government of India to respect the same principles of law and justice that guide our actions,” Ng added.Despite the current tensions, Ng expressed Canada’s openness to dialogue, stating, “The Government of Canada remains open to a dialogue with India and we look forward to continuing our valued relationship.”Her comments come as India and Canada's diplomatic relations hit rock-bottom with both the nations expelling each other's diplomats.According to the India Brand Equity Foundation, the bilateral trade between Canada and India reached USD 8.27 billion in the fiscal year 2022-2023 and USD 5.3 billion during the period from April to November 2023. In 2022, India ranked as Canada’s ninth largest merchandise trading partner in the Indo-Pacific and the 13th largest globally.Major exports from India to Canada include pharmaceutical products valued at USD 274.05 million, nuclear reactors, boilers, and parts at USD 195.46 million, and electrical machinery at USD 160.68 million for the April-November 2023 period. Conversely, key imports from Canada during the same period consisted of petroleum products at USD 608.17 million, edible vegetables at USD 420.60 million, and fertilizers at USD 337.63 million.As of September 2023, Canada is ranked as the 17th largest foreign investor in India, with cumulative investments amounting to USD 3.6 billion since April 2000, constituting approximately 0.56% of India’s total foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow.The investigation into the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia sparked a major diplomatic row between India and Canada. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was designated as a terrorist by India in July 2020.India expelled six Canadian diplomats, including the acting high commissioner on Monday, hours before Canada’s foreign ministry announced the expulsion of six Indian diplomats.These actions follow a series of tit-for-tat expulsions and suspended visa services.","India and Canada's diplomatic relations hit rock-bottom with both the nations expelling each other's diplomats.

Maharashtra: Maha Vikas Aghadi rides high on Lok Sabha poll momentum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mva-rides-high-on-ls-poll-momentum/articleshow/114267785.cms,"Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar

It’s the first time in decades that the five-year term of the assembly was split with two rival coalitions running the govt. The first one known as the MVA (comprising Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP) remained in the saddle till June 2022 when a revolt in the Shiv Sena led to Uddhav Thackeray resigning as chief minister. The man who took over, Eknath Shinde , was an MVA minister himself until he broke away and formed the Mahayuti govt, backed by the BJP and later the NCP Now as electorate takes stock, it will have to weigh MVA’s record against that of Mahayuti. Issues at stake range from execution of infra projects undertaken in the last five years to welfare schemes in health and education as well as measures taken to promote industry and agriculture. The ongoing quota stir, dissatisfaction over low fair and remunerative prices for sugarcane, export policy on onions, farmer suicides , law and order, and the sympathy wave for Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar for putative BJP-engineered splits in their parties will also impact voting.The Mahayuti govt has introduced several measures to appease farmers, while also attempting to persuade quota activist Manoj Jarange to adopt a less confrontational stance towards it. In addition, the alliance continues to assert that chief minister Eknath Shinde’s faction is the true Shiv Sena and deputy CM Ajit Pawar represents the authentic NCP. On the other hand, the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, energized by its performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, is expected to attack the Mahayuti on two fronts: highlighting the govt’s failure to address the agrarian crisis, and portraying BJP, the dominant partner of the ruling coalition, as one that specializes in splitting parties and toppling governments.The sugarbelt of the state remains politically significant as it sends 58 of the 288 assembly members. The region is a large sugarcane cultivation belt but has a growing industrial base as well. Rise in crime, particularly in and around Pune, has become a key concern.Once a Congress stronghold, the region saw a shift in the 2019 elections, with Congress winning just 10 seats, the undivided NCP securing 21, and the BJP claiming 19, riding the Modi wave, which five years earlier had propelled it to power nationally in the 2014 parliamentary elections. The upcoming battle is expected to center on similar issues, though alliances have shifted.Here, Centre’s onion export ban has stirred considerable anger, something that BJP had failed to anticipate. Known as the state’s ""kitchen bowl"", this region saw the BJP-Shiv Sena win only two of the eight Lok Sabha seats, a sharp decline from their 2014 clean sweep. In the 2019 assembly elections, the undivided BJP-Sena won 22 of the 47 seats in the five districts of the region, while Congress-NCP claimed 20. With the split in the Sena and NCP, a tight contest is expected.Long the subject of political discourse due to its droughtprone nature, it is the epicenter of the Maratha reservation agitation. The region, which has produced four chief ministers, could prove crucial to the fortunes of the alliance that eventually gains power. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-Sena managed just one of the eight seats, down from six in 2019, when the saffron alliance won 29 of the 46 assembly seats across the region's eight districts. Winning over the Maratha community here will be key to success—a near-impossible task for Mahayuti, as neutral political experts say.This region, which has the highest incidence of farmer suicides in Maharashtra, has a total of 62 assembly seats. The outcome will depend on how OBC, Dalit, and tribal voters, who make up 80% of the electorate, respond to various narratives. Farmers form the largest voter group. But they are grappling with debt, rising input costs, and a labour shortage, partly attributed to the Ladki Bahin freebie. In the 2019 polls, BJP’s seat count in Vidarbha had dropped to 29 from 44 in 2014.The state’s coastal belt is known for its Alphonso mangoes, cashew plantations, rice fields and fish. It’s also a region which faces the brunt of climate change, with cyclones battering its shores of late. Electorally, the Konkan region spans one of the state’s densest clusters: Mumbai Metropolitan Region with satellite towns like Thane, Mira-Bhayandar and Palghar. In 2019 assembly elections, the undivided Sena won 15 seats—the region was always a Sena bastion—BJP 11, NCP 5, and Congress none. Smaller parties won the remaining eight seats. Following the split in the Sena, most of its MLAs sided with the Shinde faction. In the Lok Sabha polls, Sena (UBT) suffered major losses, with BJP’s Narayan Rane winning RatnagiriSindhudurg and NCP’s Sunil Tatkare taking Raigad.","First time in decades that the five-year term of the assembly was split with two rival coalitions running the govt.

"Canada’s targeting of envoy Verma ‘absurd’, says official",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canadas-targeting-of-envoy-verma-absurd-says-official/articleshow/114267531.cms,"Asked about the allegation that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi was working for the Indian govt, official sources said Canada had not provided any “specifics” to back its claim.“The central assertion from all Canadian officials is that credible evidence has been presented to India. This was also repeated by their charge d’affaires to the press. This is simply not true.From the very beginning, the Canadian approach has been to make vague accusations and put the burden of denial on India,” said an official, responding to remarks made by Trudeau and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).“At the RCMP press briefing, assertions were made about connections of certain individuals to India. In no case were any specifics provided. There was also talk about holding people accountable. But it was never made clear who and for what,” added the official, describing as absurd that after intensively engaging Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma over the last year, the Canadian govt had chosen to target him. Verma was among the six Indian diplomats “expelled” by Canada on Monday. India, however, had said it had recalled Verma and expelled six Canadian diplomats.Speaking in the same press conference, Joly did not rule out sanctions against India. “So today was a really important step. When you look at what is available in our toolbox, expelling diplomats is one of the highest and toughest measures a country can take under Vienna Convention. Everything is on the table,” she said when asked about the possibility of sanctions.“Justin Trudeau again fails to provide compelling evidence to the public after escalating the tensions with India. Diplomats have been expelled and we are still in the ‘trust me bro’ phase. This could end up costing Canada billions in trade. All to appease Jagmeet and the gang of Khalistani ministers ,” a Canadian geopolitical analyst tweeted.Trudeau though maintained in remarks at a press conference and a lengthy statement that Canada had “clear and compelling evidence that agents of the govt of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety”, and New Delhi had rebuffed several Canadian attempts to apprise India of it.“This includes clandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder. This is unacceptable,” Trudeau said.He added that the evidence brought to light by the RCMP could not be ignored.“It leads to one conclusion: it is necessary to disrupt the criminal activities that continue to pose a threat to public safety in Canada. That is why we acted. Because we will always — first and foremost — stand for the right of Canadians to feel safe and secure in their own country,” he said.“Once again, we call on India govt to cooperate with us on this investigation, to put an end to its inaction and misleading rhetoric, to recognise the credibility and severity of the evidence and information we have shared so far, and to reiterate, in no uncertain terms, that its position on extrajudicial operations abroad will henceforth be unequivocally aligned with international law,” Trudeau added.","Official sources said Canada had not provided any “specifics” to back its claim. “From the very beginning, the Canadian approach has been to make vague accusations and put the burden of denial on India,” said an official, responding to remarks made by Trudeau and the RCMP.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114267547,imgsize-581731,width-400,resizemode-4/114267547.jpg"
"Over 800 US military veterans released under 'don’t ask, don’t tell' policy receive honorable discharges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-800-us-military-veterans-released-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy-receive-honorable-discharges/articleshow/114267124.cms,"Over 800 military personnel discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy had their service records upgraded (Representative Image)

The Pentagon announced on Tuesday that more than 800 military personnel who had been discharged under the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy have had their service records upgraded to honorable discharges . This policy, which was in effect from 1993 to 2011, prohibited LGBTQ troops from openly serving in the US armed forces and led to the discharge of thousands of service members who disclosed their sexual orientation.The announcement comes as part of broader efforts by the US government to rectify decades of discrimination. The roots of this issue date back to 1951, when Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) criminalized consensual same-sex activity.Former President Bill Clinton ’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy modified this stance in 1993, allowing LGBTQ personnel to serve as long as they did not disclose their sexual orientation. However, it was not until 2011 that Congress fully repealed the policy, allowing for open service by LGBTQ members in the military. Additionally, in 2013, the UCMJ was updated to decriminalize consensual same-sex activity, narrowing the scope of Article 125 to cover only nonconsensual acts.The move to upgrade discharges is part of a review initiated last year by defense secretary Lloyd Austin. The Pentagon estimates that approximately 13,500 service members were discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Of those, many were issued less-than-honorable discharges, which stripped them of military benefits such as educational assistance and impacted their civilian employment prospects.By upgrading more than 800 discharges, the Pentagon said that 96% of the affected personnel now have honorable discharges. However, not all of the 13,500 discharges required review. Some service members were already discharged, while others did not serve long enough to qualify for benefits or were not eligible for upgrades due to other violations.Defense secretary Austin reaffirmed the Pentagon’s commitment to honoring all who have served, saying, “We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops — including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love. We will continue to strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country.”This decision also aligns with President Joe Biden’s recent move in June to issue pardons to service members convicted under repealed military policies, further illustrating the government’s efforts to undo the damage caused by historical discrimination.","Pentagon announced on Tuesday that more than 800 military personnel who had been discharged under the “don’t ask, don’T tell” policy have had their service records upgraded to honorable discharges.

'Marriage penalty': Employment rate for Indian women drops by 1/3rd,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/marriage-penalty-employment-rate-for-indian-women-drops-by-1/3rd/articleshow/114267046.cms,"S Asia’s rates of women’s labour force presence still low: Report



NEW DLEHI: While men command a premium to get a job after marriage, women face a “marriage penalty” resulting in a sharp drop in their labour force participation , a new World Bank report says.It estimates that in India, post-marriage female employment rates drop by 12 percentage points, about one thirds of the female pre-marital employment rate, even in the absence of children.In contrast, there is a 13 percentage point premium for men post-marriage. While the premium for men erodes after five years, it persists for women.“This marriage penalty among women without children persists up to five years after wedding in India and Maldives,” the report says, while asserting that social norms may also be at the root of the “marriage penalty”.To make matters worse for women, there is also a “child penalty” as they are entrusted with childcare responsibilities, forcing many to opt out of the workforce.India, and South Asia in general, have poor female labour force participation rate, estimated at 32% in 2023, and with most countries, barring Bhutan, in the bottom quartile of World Bank’s sample. “Women with more than secondary schooling or those who marry men with more than secondary schooling are less likely to be hit by the marriage penalty, suggesting education has a role in mitigating it,” it said.Higher education levels for men as well as women can improve the situation, the study said.On the overall scenario, the ‘South Asia Development Update’ focused on “women, jobs and growth” highlights that South Asia’s rates of female labour force participation remain low despite faster-than average progress over the past three decades. Only 32% of working-age women in South Asia were in the labour force in 2023 — well below the region’s male labour force participation rate of 77%. The report further states that nearly two-thirds of working-age women are out of the labour force in the region.The reports states that “if labour force participation rates for women were raised to those of men, South Asia’s regional GDP (and, by construction, also per capita income) would be 13–51% higher.”World Bank chief economist for South Asia Franziska Ohnsorge asserted “if women worked in as productive jobs as men, GDP in the South Asian region could go up by up to 51%.” Calling South Asia, particularly India, a “bright spot” in the global economy, she said things could be “brighter” if the untapped potential of women is unlocked.Poonam Gupta, director general of National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) said, “We need to target institutional and societal causes creating the gender gaps in employment, while simultaneously making it easier, safer, remunerative, and professionally rewarding for women to join the workforce.”","Women face a ‘marriage penalty’ resulting in a sharp drop in their labour force participation.

RG Kar issue: Junior doctors' hunger strike enters 11th day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rg-kar-issue-junior-doctors-hunger-strike-enters-11th-day/articleshow/114237191.cms,"(With inputs from agency)

KOLKATA: The ongoing indefinite hunger strike by junior doctors in West Bengal, demanding action in response to the RG Kar Hospital incident, reached its 11th day on Tuesday. Despite a meeting between medical representatives and the state government, no resolution was achieved, prolonging the impasse.The situation escalated as two more doctors participating in the 'fast-unto-death' protest in Kolkata's Esplanade area fell ill, intensifying the unrest that originated from the tragic rape and murder of their colleague at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.On Monday, a critical meeting was held at Swasthya Bhavan between representatives from 12 doctors' associations and chief secretary Manoj Pant. However, the discussions concluded without any breakthrough.The hunger strike, which commenced on October 5, followed nearly 50 days of 'cease work' protests divided into two phases. The catalyst for the agitation was the horrific rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.As of Tuesday, seven junior doctors persisted in their hunger strike, with several necessitating urgent medical intervention.Pulastha Acharya, a junior doctor from NRS Medical College and Hospital, was admitted to the facility's Critical Care Unit (CCU) on Sunday night after complaining of severe stomach pain.Another junior doctor from Kolkata Medical College and Hospital, Tanaya Panja, experienced a significant deterioration in her health condition, losing consciousness and requiring immediate transfer to the medical establishment for treatment. Upon arrival, she was admitted to the CCU, where a team of doctors initiated prompt treatment.The most recent junior doctor to participate in the fast was from the ENT department of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, commencing the hunger strike on Monday afternoon.Following the unsuccessful meeting with the doctors on Monday, chief secretary Pant stated that the doctors demanded a well-defined timeline to address their concerns. However, the government maintained that such a deadline could not be provided.Pant noted that seven out of the ten demands put forth by the junior doctors had already been addressed, while the remaining three necessitated further administrative deliberation.""For the remaining three demands, they were requesting specific timelines. These are administrative decisions that the state needs to consider, so we cannot provide a deadline at this point,"" Pant said.The Joint Platform of Doctors (JPD) was invited by Pant for additional talks at the state health department headquarters. He encouraged them to cancel their scheduled 'Droher Carnival' protest on October 15.The JPD had declared the protest to show support for the junior doctors, but the government was worried that it would overlap with the state's yearly 'Durga Puja Carnival.'The junior doctors' main demands consist of justice for the RG Kar Hospital victim, the prompt dismissal of Health Secretary N S Nigam, and better workplace safety, together with further demands for a centralised hospital referral system, a bed vacancy monitoring system, and crucial infrastructure such as on-call rooms, CCTV, and adequate washrooms.Insisting on a swift and open investigation by the CBI into the alleged rape-murder at RG Kar hospital, protesting junior doctors on Monday evening marched to Raj Bhawan and delivered a memorandum to the governor's secretary.","The hunger strike by junior doctors in West Bengal reached its 11th day on Tuesday.

The six accused appears to include India's high commissioner to Canada, one of the highest ranking diplomats in India, whose diplomatic immunity Ottawa wants revoked.Meanwhile, US State Department on Tuesday confirmed that an Indian Enquiry Committee established to investigate activities of certain organized criminals is actively investigating the individual who was identified last year in the Department of Justice’s indictment as an Indian government employee who directed a foiled plot to assassinate a US citizen in New York City.US federal prosecutors last November charged Indian national Nikhil Gupta with working with an Indian government employee in the alleged foiled plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York. Gupta, who arrested in the Czech Republic in June last year, was extradited to the US and remains in custody.The US statement made no mention of the Canadian charges, but said as part of their ongoing investigations to discuss the case, including information they have obtained, the Indian team will receive an update regarding the US case. Additionally, India has informed the United States they are continuing their efforts to investigate other linkages of the former government employee and will determine follow up steps, as necessary, it added.","Canada has invoked support from its ""five eyes"" intelligence partners and G-7 nations to warn India of sanctions over allegations that New Delhi is involved in transnational hits of Khalistani terrorists on its territory. “Everything is on the table,"" Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said at a news conference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114259958,imgsize-22906,width-400,resizemode-4/114259958.jpg"

However, Jaishankar, was neither scheduled to call on Shehbaz separately nor have a formal bilateral meeting with his counterpart Ishaq Dar, who was present at the dinner, during his 24-hour stay in Islamabad.After having ruled out a bilateral meeting, both sides also played down expectations of a brief pull aside on the sidelines of the summit on Wednesday, maintaining Jaishankar’s presence in Pakistan was about the SCO, the security-oriented Eurasian bloc which counts India and Pakistan as full member-states since 2017.After the dinner, Pakistan minister of planning and development Ahsan Iqbal put the onus for a bilateral meeting on India, saying that Pakistan, as the host, can’t propose any such meeting. Asked about the exchange of greetings between Jaishankar and Shehbaz, the minister also said it was time for both sides to uphold the Lahore Declaration that Shebaz’s brother Nawaz Sharif reached with then Indian PM A B Vajpayee in 1999.There was also a cultural programme at the dinner in which a Pakistani dancer performed Bharatanatyam. Shehbaz was seated next to his Chinese and Kazakhstan counterparts at the dinner table and there wasn’t much of an exchange between him and Jaishankar during the dinner.The SCO heads of government meeting is focused on the trade and economic agenda of the organisation. Ahead of Jaishankar’s arrival in Islamabad, the government said in a statement India remains actively engaged in the SCO format, including various mechanisms and initiatives within the SCO framework. Jaishankar himself announced his arrival in a post on X, uploading photos of him being greeted by children at the airport.Jaishankar met Chinese Premier Li Qiang too at the dinner. He will address the summit on Wednesday, underlining India’s position, without naming China or Pakistan, that all member-states must respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial connectivity while pursuing connectivity and infrastructure initiatives.The government of Pakistan uploaded a video of Jaishankar’s arrival for the SCO meeting, saying “exciting discussions ahead’’. A meeting between Jaishankar and Dar remained a remote possibility though.``I don’t think there is any expectation of a breakthrough in bilateral ties during the visit by the Indian minister,’’ said former Pakistan interim PM Anwaar-ul-haq Kakar, responding to a query from ToI. Considered close to the federal government, Kakar, however, also said the visit by Jaishankar, even if for a multilateral event, could provide an opening for engagement between the 2 countries. Asked why Pakistan had not proposed a meeting, Kakar said an outreach to India could hurt the government in the elections and would provoke widespread protests by PTI supporters.India is unlikely to itself propose any sort of meeting with Pakistan during Jaishankar’s visit. As former Indian high commissioner Ajay Bisaria says, India has already taken the bold step of sending Jaishankar and the onus is now on Islamabad to use this opportunity to stabilise ties by proposing a meaningful conversation. For any improvement in bilateral ties, India would like Pakistan to first review its decision to recall its high commissioner, after India revoked the special status of J&K.",Foreign minister S Jaishankar began his visit to Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) heads of government meeting. It was the first by any Indian foreign minister in nearly a decade. He participated in a dinner hosted by PM Shehbaz Sharif for the delegates.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114262347,imgsize-1773269,width-400,resizemode-4/114262347.jpg"
'You will all die': What bomb threat posts for seven flights said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-will-all-die-what-bomb-threat-posts-for-seven-flights-said/articleshow/114256994.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seven flights received bomb threats online on Tuesday, threatening to blow up the planes, prompting security agencies to undertake counter-terrorism drills.The threats, posted on the microblogging site X, occurred a day after three international flights departing from Mumbai faced similar bomb threats, causing inconvenience to hundreds of passengers and airline staff.The messages posted on Monday were later determined to be a hoax.According to a report from PTI, the sources revealed that an X handle issued threats to seven flights on Tuesday, including an Air India Express flight from Jaipur to Bengaluru via Ayodhya (IX765), a SpiceJet flight from Darbhanga to Mumbai (SG116), an Akasa Air flight from Bagdogra to Bengaluru (QP 1373), an Air India flight from Delhi to Chicago (AI 127), an Indigo flight from Dammam (Saudi Arabia) to Lucknow (6E 98), an Alliance Air Amritsar-Dehradun-Delhi flight (9I 650), and an Air India Express flight (IX 684) from Madurai to Singapore.Following a request from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to cyber-security agencies, the X handle responsible for the threats has been suspended by the platform.An Air India Express spokesperson informed PTI that they, along with several other operators, received a ""specific"" security threat from an unverified social media handle.The X user posted, ""@AirIndiaX @jaipur_police @JprRuralPolice I placed bombs onboard of Flight IX765. The bombs will go off very soon. Blood will spread everywhere. Hurry up and evacuate, you don't have much time left.""In response, security protocols were immediately activated as per the instructions of the government-appointedBomb Threat Assessment Committee. The flight landed safely, and the aircraft will be released for operations after completing all required security procedures, according to the spokesperson.The SpiceJet aircraft landed safely at the Mumbai airport and was directed to an isolation bay as a precautionary measure. The X user threatened, ""@flyspicejet Hi. There are explosives onboard of Flight SEJ116. The bombs will go off soon. You will all die. Down to plane quickly before it's too late.""A SpiceJet spokesperson confirmed that all passengers disembarked normally, and security agencies were promptly notified. After thorough security checks, the aircraft was cleared for further operations.An Akasa Air spokesperson said that their flight received a security alert on board. The X user threatened, ""Placed explosives onboard of Flight QP1373. Which departed from Siliguri and is Landing in Bengaluru. You will all die.""The captain followed all necessary emergency procedures and landed safely at the Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru at 13:39 hours. All passengers were deplaned, and local authorities conducted the required safety and security checks before releasing the aircraft for operations.The Air India flight was also diverted to the Iqaluit airport in Canada after becoming the subject of an online security threat. The X user wrote, ""@AirIndia @DelhiPolice @CellDelhi. There are bombs onboard of Flight Al127. The bombs will soon go off. The flight departed from Delhi and is going towards Chicago. You will all die.

A spokesperson for the airline said that the safety and security of their passengers and crew is their highest priority and that they are working closely with the relevant authorities and taking all necessary precautions as per the guidelines. The Dammam-Lucknow flight landed at the Jaipur airport following its diversion and has been sent to an isolation bay, according to an official at the Jaipur airport.An Alliance Air official confirmed that all precautionary measures were being taken for the Amritsar-Dehradun-Delhi flight, which was undergoing security checks at the Dehradun airport.Air India Express sources mentioned that their Madurai-Singapore flight was awaiting approval from Singaporean authorities for landing.The suspect X handle tagged the respective airlines' and some police handles, claiming that bombs were placed on these planes, according to the sources.Four different X handles issued similar threats to three international flights originating from Mumbai on Monday. All the messages on Monday were declared a hoax after security and intelligence agencies, as well as airline and airport operators, carried out stipulated anti-terrorist security drills that are activated in case of bomb or hijack threats, the sources said.Officials said that the BCAS has sought the assistance of Indian cyber-security agencies and police to identify the person or people responsible for these threats.","Seven flights received bomb threats online on Tuesday, threatening to blow up the planes.

Quota row puts an out-of-sync Mahayuti in a tighter spot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-row-puts-an-out-of-sync-mahayuti-in-a-tighter-spot/articleshow/114263153.cms,"Jarange's jang

Tightrope walk for Mahayuti

Not easy for MVA either

Has caste buried other issues?

Protests by the Maratha, OBC and Dhangar communities in Marathwada are expected to cast a long shadow over voting patterns in the state, much like during the Lok Sabha polls. With BJP reeling from its poor performance even five months after the polls (it did not win even a single of the four seats it contested in Marathwada, and Mahayuti won just one-Aurangabad-out of the region's eight seats) party workers, wary of another defeat, were recently told by NDA chairman and Union home minister Amit Shah that the Centre would help to resolve the issue.Besides voter fatigue and anti-incumbency sentiment, the Mahayuti's poor show was largely explained by the region's dominant community, the Marathas, led by quota activist Manoj Jarange, turning their backs on the governing alliance. With internal tensions over issues like claiming credit for the Ladki Bahin Yojana already weakening Mahayuti, the ongoing quota dispute does not bode well for the BJP-led alliance, though it won't spare MVA either.Jarange has said Maharashtra should not go to the polls and the model code of conduct must not come into force until the govt declares a quota for Marathas from the OBC share. ""Marathas account for nearly 55% of the state's population. Mahayuti will face a poll debacle if it attracts the wrath of our community,"" said Jarange, who went on six hunger strikes within a year over his demand that Marathas be given Kunbi certificates to make them eligible for OBC benefits. This has riled the OBC communities, led by Laxman Hake, a former member of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission. Hake, who too resorted to hunger strikes to protect OBC reservation from ""encroachment"" by Marathas, told TOI that the Maratha stir would perhaps have the unwitting effect of uniting OBCs: ""Though OBCs form the largest community in the state, they are not united. Heavily influenced by regional politicians, instead of thinking about the community's best overall interests, they focus on the narrow minded issues of local politicians. So, our agitation is an attempt to voice the concerns of the entire community. If we unite, it will have a deciding impact.""Realising that quota protests will likely impact the poll outcome in most regions, and not just Marathwada, the govt has been on a tightrope walk on the matter. For example, the Dhangar agitation for inclusion in the ST category has compelled the govt to hold talks with everyone. Thus, in May, chief minister Eknath Shinde said the govt had ""walked the extra mile"" to grant 10% SEBC reservation to Marathas by distributing thousands of Kunbi certificates. But Marathas rejected it saying that the 10% quota is legally fragile and only reservation through OBC quota would be foolproof. This made Shinde and other Mahayuti leaders blame the opposition for not attending an all-party meet ""to build consensus"". Hake seems to have had the last word. He cornered Mahayuti saying, ""We'll ensure the victory of 50 MLAs who supported us in protecting the OBC quota. We'll inflict loss upon an equal number who colluded with the forces determined to end our quota.""MVA is keen on carrying the LS poll momentum in Marathwada but Jarange has not spared its leaders either, accusing them of letting down the community. A month ago, a group of Maratha protesters stopped NCP (SP) leader Sharad Pawar 's car in Barshi and shouted disruptive slogans during his rally. Some of them met him at his residence in Pune a day later and told him to clear his stand on the quota issue. On Oct 4, Pawar reiterated his stand that Marathas should be given reservation without disturbing the quota of other communities and said his party will support the govt if it brings an amendment and increases quotas to 75%. But Jarange insists on the inclusion of Marathas in the OBC category within the existing reservation. As for Hake, he trashed Pawar's proposal, calling it unconstitutional.Social activist and independent observer Vishnu Dhobale said caste agitation has become an easy way to establish political leadership: ""It takes attention away from common issues of public good. It will affect the poll manifestos of parties.""But state president of Sambhaji Brigade, Pravin Gaikwad, said the Maratha agitation will have limited impact on the assembly polls. ""Though caste rallies draw crowds, people don't necessarily vote on those issues as other calculations are involved. Thus, I feel the impact of the Maratha agitation will be limited. Economically, the Maratha community in Marathwada is weaker compared to those residing in western Maharashtra or Vidarbha. Therefore, the anger against established politicians is more in Marathwada, which percolates through votes.""","Protests by the Maratha, OBC and Dhangar communities in Marathwada are expected to cast a long shadow over voting patterns in the state. With internal tensions over issues like claiming credit for the Ladki Bahin Yojana already weakening Mahayuti, the ongoing quota dispute does not bode well for the BJP-led alliance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114263159,imgsize-913023,width-400,resizemode-4/114263159.jpg"

To ensure this, it would be mandatory for all such establishments to display a signboard and require all staff members to wear identification badges, he said.The law will have harsh penal provisions for those using pseudonyms or providing false information.Food outlet owners will also have to provide details of personnel employed at their establishments to the relevant authorities. The law should provide for strict action if it is confirmed that any personnel in a food establishment is an infiltrator or a foreign national illegally staying in India, CM said at a meeting to discuss the proposed legislation. The proposed law comes after UP govt faced flak for its order mandating eateries along the Kanwar yatra route to display the names of owners and staffers, with SC staying the directive.The proposed law will also make it mandatory to install CCTV cameras in the kitchens and dining areas of all food establishments for continuous monitoring, with at least one month's footage made available to the district administration upon request.Among other rules for eateries, govt is expected to enforce laws requiring those preparing and serving food to wear head covers, masks and gloves.","The new law would grant every consumer the ""right to know essential information"" about food and beverage sellers and service providers.

Threats for 10 aircraft in 1.5 days: AI & IndiGo international flights divert; AI to recover cost from pranksters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/threats-play-havoc-2-international-flights-diverted-ai-to-canada-government-promises-action/articleshow/114256881.cms,"NEW DELHI: The menace of hoax threat messages playing havoc with flight schedules and passengers continues unabated. On Tuesday, at least seven flights — including an Air India Delhi-Chicago flight that had to be diverted to a nondescript Canadian town of Iqaluit and IndiGo ’s Dammam-Lucknow to Jaipur — saw such threats after three on Monday when AI’s Mumbai-New York nonstop was diverted to Delhi for this reason.Checks revealed the four Tuesday threats — including for AI 127 Delhi-Chicago diverted flight; IndiGo’s 6E 98 Dammam-Lucknow diverted; Air India Express Jaipur-Ayodhya; SpiceJet ’s SG 116 Darbhanga-Mumbai and Akasa ’s QP 1373 Bagdogra-Bengaluru — were hoax. Threats for some of these flights were posted on X (former Twitter) from a handle — @schizobomber777 — that has been suspended now.As per protocol, after getting any threat aircraft — baggage and passengers — are thoroughly checked before being are released for next flight or continuing the journey. But on long hauls like AI’s affected nonstops of last two days, this means the same crew can’t operate the flight as they will breach their maximum duty time limitations and a fresh set of crew has to be arranged. Doing so in a remote Canadian town takes time. Providing for well over 300 passengers at a small airport that many flyers can’t even exit for hotels till alternate arrangements are made due to lack of visas is also an uphill task for any airline.Airlines are urging Govt to crack down on this menace that troubles passengers; disrupts schedules and costs a lot. Air India will “consider legal action against those responsible to recover damages incurred by the airline.”The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had this June proposed to the Union aviation ministry that people people making hoax threats to flights and other aviation-linked infra be put on no fly list. However, this deterrent is yet to be put in place. A senior aviation ministry official said: “BCAS didn’t identity the relevant law to base this move on. We will work it out.”BCAS DG Zulfiquar Hasan Tuesday sounded a stern warning to all those issuing these hoax messages. “All standard operating procedures were followed. All our flights are safe and the Indian skies are absolutely safe. We are confident of tracing all those behind these threat messages and very strict action under law will be taken against all of them. Police across the country is cooperating in ensuring this happens.” Hassan ensured air travellers amid growing threats that “there is zero risk in flying.”An airline spokesperson said about Tuesday diversion: “Flight AI127 operating from Delhi to Chicago on Oct 15, 2024, was the subject of a security threat posted online and, as a precautionary measure, has landed at Iqaluit Airport in Canada. The aircraft and passengers are being re-screened as per the laid down security protocol. Air India has activated agencies at the airport to assist the passengers until such time that their journey can resume.”“Air India notes that it, and other local airlines, have been subject to a number of threats in recent days. Though all have subsequently been found to be hoaxes, as a responsible airline operator all threats are taken seriously. The inconvenience to customers is sincerely regretted. Air India is extending all cooperation to authorities in identifying the perpetrators of such threats to ensure that they are held accountable for the disruption and inconvenience caused to passengers, and will consider legal action against those responsible to recover damages incurred by the airline,” the airline added.IndiGo said in a statement: “Flight 6E 98, operating from Dammam to Lucknow, was redirected to Jaipur due to a security-related alert. The aircraft was isolated, and all passengers were safely disembarked. Ensuring the safety and security of our customers and crew remains paramount in all facets of our operations. We are working closely with the relevant authorities, and mandated checks are currently underway. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this situation may have caused our customers and appreciate their understanding.” SpiceJet and Akasa statements also said safety is paramount for them.","Airlines are urging Govt to crack down on this menace that troubles passengers; disrupts schedules and costs a lot.

""I wonder if the initial trends (at 8.05-8.10 am) were put out (by the news channels) only to justify the exit poll predictions,"" he said.Stating that a mismatch between expectations created by exit poll predictions and actual results can sometimes lead to serious issues, Kumar said that ""the gap between expectation and achievement is nothing but frustration"".Suggesting that it was time for reflection and introspection by those conducting and disseminating exit poll outcomes, particularly the electronic media, the CEC said even though the EC does not govern exit polls under the existing statutory regime, ""there is a need to introspect and self-regulate in terms of the sample size and location surveyed, methodology, fixing responsibility in the event of survey findings not matching with actual results, and making public disclosures in the interest of transparency"".He opined that the time had come for bodies like NBDSA (News Broadcasting & Digital Standards Authority), which govern exit polls, to do some self-regulation. ""I am sure all those responsible will do self-correction,"" he said.Kumar said after setting the expectations of parties and the public regarding the result, when counting started at 8 am for J&K and Haryana, there were instances of news channels putting out leads as early as 8.05-8.10 am. ""This is nonsense. Counting begins only by 8.30 am. I wonder if the initial trends (at 8.05-8.10 am) were put out only to justify the exit poll predictions.

But still, the first set of trends are known only after 9.10 am or so,"" Kumar underlined.All the exit polls conducted in Haryana had predicted a comfortable win to a landslide for Congress. The leads shown by news channels echoed the predictions very early into the counting, sparking celebrations in the Congress camp. However, the picture started changing by 10 am, possibly as the first set of trends were uploaded on the EC website. By 10.30 am, BJP had surged ahead of Congress in terms of leads, prompting the latter to question the delay in posting of trends, and later, lodge complaints about the discrepancy in battery life of EVMs.","Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said the electronic media putting out counting leads as early as 8.05-8.10 am was ""nonsense"" He pointed out that actual counting begins only by 8.30 am, with the first set of trends emerging around 9.10am.

Quantified disability won’t disentitle a candidate from edu admissions: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quantified-disability-wont-disentitle-a-candidate-from-edu-admissions-sc/articleshow/114266864.cms,"Disability board’s negative view on candidate can be challenged: SC



NEW DELHI : In a landmark verdict meant to demolish barriers on entry of people with disability in educational institutions, Supreme Court on Tuesday held that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate from being considered for admission in educational institutions and they would be eligible for admission if Disability Assessment Board opines that the disability won't come in the way of pursuing a course of study.Rules, guiding admission to various professional courses, fix a benchmark of quantified disability and a candidate is barred from admission if the level of disability is above that. Like in the case of speech and language disability , a person with above 40% disability is not entitled to pursue MBBS study as per Graduate Medical Education Regulations. It allowed a plea of a student with 45% speech and language disability.Allowing a plea of a student with 45% speech and language disability whose dream to pursue study in medicine was blocked by the regulation despite cracking NEET , a Supreme Court bench of Justices B R Gavai, Aravind Kumar, K V Viswanathan said merely because of the quantification of the disability for speech and language at 40% or above, a candidate does not forfeit his right to stake a claim for admission to course of their choice. The court granted relief to the student after medical board told SC that his disability would not hamper pursuing medicine course.Justice Viswanathan said the decision to allow admission or not should be taken on the basis of a report by Disability Assessment Board which will specify whether the disability will or will not come in the way of the candidate pursuing the course. The court said that any decision taken by boards, which give a negative opinion for the candidate, will be amenable to challenge in judicial proceedings. The court said the boards should positively record whether the disability will or will not come in the way of the candidate pursuing the course in question and should give reasons in the event of coming to the conclusion.Justice Viswanathan said there is a need to have inclusive approach to bring differently-abled persons to social mainstream and give them opportunity to grow their potential to the fullest and reminded that the world would have been so much the poorer if Homer, Milton, Mozart, Beethoven, Byron and many more would not have been allowed to realise their full potential.Observing that it is the constitutional goal for the State to make effective provisions for securing the right to education including for persons with disabilities, the bench said an inclusive attitude will have be taken furthering the concept of reasonable accommodation recognised in the RPwD Act.",A person with above 40% disability is not entitled to pursue MBBS study as per Graduate Medical Education Regulations.

NEW DELHI: Indian government believes Canadian PM Justin Trudeau 's move to escalate matters over the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was triggered by his deposition scheduled for Wednesday before an influential commission to explain the charge that his government has been derelict in preventing China's interference in domestic politics.Top sources here maintained that Trudeau fired his fresh volley of charges, essentially a reiteration of his earlier accusations, on the eve of the appearance of functionaries of his office before the Foreign Interference Commission , which is holding a hearing into the charge of the liberal regime having failed to stop China from having a free run in Ottawa.""The effort seems to be a counter to the damning perception by manufacturing a narrative that it was India which was meddling in internal affairs,"" said a source familiar with details of multiple rounds of parleys between the two govts since last year when Trudeau first raised the alleged involvement of Indian agencies in Nijjar's killing.He also said that despite the feverish sabre-rattling, Trudeau and his security establishment, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which broke away from its protocol to go public with its accusations, have yet to produce evidence to back up their ""outrageous charge"".""Insinuations and show of righteous indignation cannot be a substitute for evidence,"" said another top source as he debunked the Trudeau regime's claim that they had shared strong evidence with India in support of their case.""In contrast, we have shared incontrovertible evidence of terrorists like Nijjar and his sympathisers using Canada as their base. We cited specific instances of crimes with dates and other details so strong that they had to acknowledge Nijjar's involvement in terror activities,"" the source said.The security establishment here also emphasised that while the proliferation of criminal gangs was an open secret and has caused concern, the Trudeau regime remained in denial mode because of the fear of annoying groups which have acquired outsized clout at a time the PM's approval ratings are declining before elections.""To present rivalries of criminals as a vast foreign conspiracy may be justified in appeasement playbook but it certainly does not qualify for statecraft,"" the source said.Sources, however, seemed keen to insulate bilateral ties from the resentment over Trudeau's conduct.

As Mumbai's real estate market flourished towards the end of the last century, so did Siddique's political career and fortunes as he built his real estate empire.By 1998, the new slum rehab policy, offering free homes to eligible families, unveiled a new frontier for several builders who unearthed a treasure trove in prime slum properties, especially in the western suburbs between Bandra, Khar and Santacruz, where the late politician had a formidable influence.Siddique was known to be intimate with the Wadhawans of HDIL , one of the trailblazers in the field of rehabilitating slumdwellers and then utilising a portion of the plot to construct luxury residential towers and commercial buildings.Among the first significant SRA projects to be executed with Siddique's assistance was Daulat Nagar slum in Santacruz West, which was redeveloped by Rakesh Wadhawan of HDIL and builder-turned-Congress politician from Rajasthan Rafique Mandelia, a close confidant of Siddique. Mandelia is worth Rs 166 crore, according to his declared assets during last year's assembly elections in Rajasthan.In 1999, Siddique contested for the assembly elections from Bandra West and won comfortably. He was now an MLA as well as a corporator. It was during this phase that he became acquainted with the workings of BMC's building proposal department in the western suburbs and knew every official in thisdepartment, which approved building plans. Market sources said the former MLA was well-informed of the facts of every new tower and slum redevelopment project in his constituency, and that no building occupation certificate could be procured without his knowledge.In 2004, Siddique registered his construction firm, Zears Developers Pvt Ltd. One of the first projects was the Link Square mall in the shopping district of Linking Road in Bandra.On 16th Road he redeveloped an old society plot and constructed a residential tower called Shiv-Asthan Heights. Near Pali Naka, Bandra, the Siddiques built a residential highrise called Maqba Heights, where the extended family resides.A luxury tower at Bandra Reclamation, 81 Aureate, located near a slum, got Siddique into trouble in 2017. The Enforcement Directorate raided him for alleged money laundering and attached 33 high-end apartments in the building. The case later collapsed and the flats were released. A Bandra builder said the former MLA's business empire would be worth ""at least Rs 15,000 crore"". ""Not many know that he had business interests in Dubai and London, too,"" he said.

History with Trudeaus

NEW DELHI: Justin Trudeau 's aggression towards India coincides with the Canadian Prime Minister's sliding popularity ratings at home and growing dissent against him, which are being seen to have enhanced the need for him to woo the politically-significant Sikh community ahead of next year's federal elections.Amid complaints over rising cost of living, a struggling healthcare system, and growing crime rate, an Ipsos poll showed that just 26% saw Trudeau as the best PM candidate, 19 percentage points below Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.This comes after two electoral setbacks. Last month, the in-power Liberal Party lost in Montreal, seen as a safe seat, just three months after being defeated in a special election in Toronto after holding the seat for three decades. To make matters worse, Jagmeet Singh 's New Democratic Party withdrew support to the minority Liberal govt days before the Montreal loss. Singh has been a supporter of Khalistan There have been calls from Trudeau's party colleagues for him to step down, as many experts are predicting that the Liberals will face the same plight as the Conservatives in the UK. Trudeau is holding on after surviving two no-confidence motions in Parliament.Canada has over 7.7 lakh Sikhs, the fourth-largest ethnic community, with a section backing the demand for Khalistan.India was always skeptical of Trudeau's policy on pro-Khalistan separatists. In 2018, PM Narendra Modi met him on the sixth day of his first official visit to the country amid a controversy over an invitation for a dinner at the Canadian high commission to businessman Jaspal Atwal who was convicted but later acquitted in a plot to assassinate a Punjab minister in Vancouver Island in 1986. While the invitation was withdrawn, Trudeau sought to distance himself from the controversy.There was, however, no change in stance as the Trudeau govt refused to clamp down on protests outside Indian consulates, some of which saw demonstrators burning the Indian flag.On the 40th anniversary of Operation Bluestar, processions in Ontario and Toronto saw floats depicting the assassination of former PM Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards in 1984. The Canadian govt refused to stop a referendum on Khalistan, which was backed by Sikhs for Justice.Relations hit a low after Trudeau alleged that ""Indian agents"" were involved in the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. The Canadian PM made the accusations soon after his return from New Delhi after the G20 Summit in Sept. India not only denied the allegations but sought concrete evidence, which Canada has refused to provide.The two sides halted negotiations for a trade agreement and India temporarily stopped processing visas as it feared for the safety of its mission staff in Canada. Over 40 Canadian diplomats were withdrawn from missions in India after New Delhi raised the principle of reciprocity in staffing.Canada also sought to include India in a probe into alleged election interference.During a meeting with Trudeau on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in New Delhi last year, PM Modi had expressed concern over anti-India activities in Canada by extremists.This is, however, not the first time that separatists have caused major friction in bilateral ties between India and Canada. Trudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau, a former PM, was accused of mishandling ties with New Delhi as Canadian authorities had failed to act against Khalistani extremists in the 1980s.Elliott had refused India's request for extradition of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a member of Babbar Khalsa, who fled to Canada after being accused of killing two cops in Punjab. An alleged mastermind of the 1985 Kanishka bombing, he was killed in Punjab seven years later.","Canada has over 7.7 lakh Sikhs, the fourth-largest ethnic community, with a section backing the demand for Khalistan. Relations hit a low after Trudeau alleged that ""Indian agents"" were involved in the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114231151,imgsize-345945,width-400,resizemode-4/114231151.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar on Tuesday questioned the practice of showing winning/losing trends 5 to 10 minutes after the official beginning of counting at 8am on election result days.""Showing winning/losing trends at 8.05am or 8.10am, which is just five or ten minutes after start of counting at 8am is nonsense,"" CEC Rajiv Kumar said when asked about the fallout of failed exit poll predictions.The CEC went on to question if these ""early"" trends are made to justify the exit poll results. ""The actual counting starts at 8.30am and the first trends are uploaded on EC website at 9.30am,"" the CEC said.""A major distortion is being created due to Exit Polls and expectations set by it. This is a matter of deliberation and introspection for the Press, especially for electronic media. In the last few elections, 2-3 things are happening simultaneously if we look at the entire canvas together...First, an Exit Poll comes - we don't govern it ... But there is a need for self-introspection, that what was the sample size, where was the survey done, how did the result come and what is my responsibility if I did not match to that result, are there disclosures - all of these need to be seen. There are bodies which govern this...I am sure the time has come that Associations/Bodies which govern, will do some self-regulation...Counting happens roughly on the third day after the elections end,"" he said.""Expectations rise from 6 pm...but there is no scientific base to this in public disclosure. When counting begins, results start pouring at 8.05-8.10 am. This is nonsense. The first counting (of EVMs) begins at 8.30 am...Are the initial trends to justify the Exit Poll?...We start putting the results at 9.30 am on the website...So, when the actual results start coming in, there is a mismatch. That mismatch can lead to serious issues sometimes. The gap between expectations and achievements is nothing but frustration. So, this issue is such that needs some deliberation,"" Kumar said.""The exit polls lead to gap between expectations and actual achievement and this can have serious implications,"" CEC Rajiv Kumar said. He hoped for introspection and self-correction by the organisations involved in exit polls and stressed the need for self-regulation.","Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar questioned the practice of showing winning/losing trends 5 to 10 minutes after the official beginning of counting at 8am on election result days.

Preposterous imputations: India slams Canada



India expels 6 Canadian diplomats



Stewart Ross Wheeler, Acting High Commissioner Patrick Hebert, Deputy High Commissioner Marie Catherine Joly, First Secretary lan Ross David Trites, First Secretary Adam James Chuipka, First Secretary Paula Orjuela, First Secretary

Diplomatic tensions between India and Canada peaked on Monday with the Centre deciding to withdraw the High Commissioner and other ""targeted diplomats and officials"", and then later expelling 6 Canadian diplomats.The announcement to recall the High Commissioner came shortly after the ministry of external affairs summoned Canada's charge d' affairs Stewart Wheeler over PM Justin Trudeau 's serious allegations against New Delhi.Also Read: India expels 6 Canadian diplomats ""The Canadian Charge d'Affaires was summoned by Secretary (East) this evening. He was informed that the baseless targeting of the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats and officials in Canada was completely unacceptable,"" the MEA said in a statement.""It was underlined that in an atmosphere of extremism and violence, the Trudeau Government's actions endangered their safety. We have no faith in the current Canadian Government's commitment to ensure their security. Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials. It was also conveyed that India reserves the right to take further steps in response to the Trudeau Government’s support for extremism, violence and separatism against India,"" the MEA said after meeting Wheeler.Also Read: Why the Trudeaus have had difficult relations with India Coming out of the MEA office, Wheeler gave a short statement to reporters: ""Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. Now, it is time for India to live up to what it said it would do and look into all those allegations. It is in the interest of both our countries and the people of our countries to get to the bottom of this. Canada stands ready to cooperate with India.""The foreign ministry's action followed the Centre's condemnation of Canada's decision to investigate the Indian ambassador and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" likely in connection with the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Khalistani terrorist .India strongly rejected Trudeau's allegations against its diplomats, calling them ""baseless"" and politically motivated. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) accused Trudeau of using anti-India rhetoric for domestic political gains, citing his past association with separatist elements.Also Read: 'Have shared irrefutable evidence', says Canadian diplomat ""The government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Trudeau government that is centred around vote bank politics,"" the MEA said in a statement.""Prime Minister Trudeau’s hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard. That his Government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters,"" it had said.Later in the evening, the Centre on Monday decided to expel 6 Canadian diplomats.They have been asked to leave India by or before 11.59pm on October 19.","Diplomatic tensions between India and Canada peaked on Monday with the Centre deciding to withdraw the High Commissioner and other ""targeted diplomats and officials"" India strongly rejected Trudeau's allegations against its diplomats, calling them ""baseless"" and politically motivated.

Pankaj Oswal , a renowned industrialist of Indian origin, has filed an appeal with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention , seeking international intervention in the alleged illegal detention of his 26-year-old daughter, Vasundhara Oswal , in Uganda .According to Oswal, his daughter has been detained without trial since 1 October, following what he claims to be ""corporate and political manipulation"", reported EU Reporter.Vasundhara, the executive director of PRO Industries , has reportedly been denied basic rights, including access to family and legal representation. Pankaj Oswal alleged that the charges against her were fabricated by a former employee, who had stolen valuables and taken a loan of USD 200,000 with Oswal’s family as guarantors.When the Oswal family refused to repay the loan, they allegedly faced false accusations aimed at evading the financial obligations. Despite the employee being apprehended in Tanzania, Vasundhara has been unjustly accused of kidnapping and attempted murder, according to her father.In his appeal to the UN, Oswal detailed the harsh conditions under which his daughter is being held, stating that Vasundhara was interrogated under degrading circumstances, held for over 90 hours without access to her family or a lawyer, and transferred between various prisons to prevent contact with her loved ones.Even after a court ordered her unconditional release, Oswal claimed that Ugandan authorities continued to detain her, adding inadmissible charges to block her release on bail.Vasundhara’s mother, Radhika Oswal, expressed her anguish in an interview, describing the situation as ""every mother’s nightmare"" and calling for her daughter’s immediate release. She emphasised the denial of Vasundhara’s basic human rights and dignity during her imprisonment.Additionally, Oswal has written an open letter to the President of Uganda, appealing for his intervention. In a further effort to secure his daughter’s release, Oswal has engaged renowned human rights lawyer Cherie Blair CBE, KC, whose office stated that Vasundhara’s treatment constitutes a breach of both domestic and international laws.The Oswal family, known for their global business ventures, has paused their plans to invest USD 150 million in a new alcohol plant in Uganda until the situation is resolved.Vasundhara Oswal, who holds a Bachelor’s degree in Finance from the University of Switzerland, has been credited with spearheading sustainability initiatives and debt reduction projects at PRO Industries. Despite her professional achievements, she now finds herself in a foreign prison, caught in what her family describes as a politically motivated case .","Pankaj Oswal, a renowned industrialist of Indian origin, has filed an appeal with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

Here's how much ransom amount Star Health hacker demanded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/heres-how-much-ransom-amount-star-health-hacker-demanded/articleshow/114178127.cms,"How the hacker stole Star Health’s data



Star Health , the largest health insurer in the country, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company has now revealed that the hacker responsible for the leak demanded a $68,000 (nearly 57.21 lakhs) ransom in August. The company noted that ""the threat actor demanded a ransom of $68,000 in an email"" addressed to its managing director and chief executive.The breach, which was first reported in September, has led to a reputational and business crisis for the company. Star Health’s shares have since declined by 11%. The company launched internal investigations and has also taken legal action against the messaging app Telegram and the hacker. The report claims that the hacker’s website continues to share samples of Star customers' data.This statement comes after stock exchanges asked Star Health for clarification over another Reuters report which claimed that the company was investigating allegations about its chief security officer being involved in the data leak.Later on, the company announced that it had found no wrongdoing by the official, Amarjeet Khanuja. However, the internal investigation stays open.The hacker exploited Telegram chatbots and a dedicated website to disseminate the stolen data and continues to share samples of customer information. In response to the breach, Star Health launched internal investigations and initiated legal action against Telegram and the hacker. The company is also collaborating with Indian cyber security authorities to address the situation.Despite receiving multiple notices from the insurance company, Telegram has refused to share information about the hacker's accounts or permanently ban them from the platform, Star Health said. The company also identified the hacker as ""xenZen"" in their latest statement.However, earlier, the Dubai-based messenger app said that it removed the chatbots as soon as it was flagged to the platform.","Star Health, India's largest health insurer, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
