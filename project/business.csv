WACE of Australia is 1st foreign government-backed board in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wace-of-australia-is-1st-foreign-government-backed-board-in-india/articleshow/121684705.cms,"NEW DELHI: After becoming the first country to establish foreign university campuses in India with the entry of University of Wollongong and Deakin University, Australia is now extending its footprint into school education, as Western Australia's WACE has become the first foreign govt-backed school board to begin operations in India, receiving equivalence from the Association of Indian Universities for its Class X and Class XII qualifications. This is the first such approval for a foreign board in India in 25 years.WACE, or Western Australian Certificate of Education, is the school-leaving qualification for students in Western Australia, administered by state's School Curriculum and Standards Authority (SCSA). WAIS, or the Western Australian International School System, is the framework through which this curriculum is delivered in international partner schools.Ange Smith, principal consultant for international education at SCSA, said the board has been running its international education programme since 1987 and began expanding its global presence more actively in 2019. ""Since then, we've worked with govt bodies in several countries to secure foreign board equivalence. India has been one of the most rigorous but rewarding. After AIU approval, we focused on identifying partner schools in India,"" she said.The board is currently operational in 16 countries.She said the National Education Policy 2020 played a significant role in shaping their entry strategy. ""We undertook curriculum mapping and found alignment with NEP priorities, especially around holistic development, skill integration and nurturing students beyond academics.""Explaining the curriculum structure, Smith said WAIS students take five subjects each in classes XI and XII, with an option to take six. English is compulsory, but only the top four ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) courses count towards the final university entrance score. ""ATAR is based 50% on final exams and 50% on school-assessed coursework. This reduces pressure and supports consistent performance over two years,"" she said.In response to a request from Indian partner schools, Smith confirmed that work is underway to introduce a 10th board exam for WAIS students in India. ""Some Indian states may require a 10th board certificate for transitions, so we are developing one specifically for this context,"" she said.Syed Sultan Ahmed, chairperson of the Association of International Schools of India, said WAIS offers a balance between accessibility and international standards. ""It sits between CBSE and Cambridge. A CBSE school charging Rs 1 - 1.2 lakh annually can adopt WAIS with a 15-20% fee increase. It opens up global pathways without requiring Rs 45 lakh fees like IB,"" he said. The first WAIS partner schools in India have been established in Bengaluru and Bidar, both in Karnataka.Ahmed said the ATAR rank helps WAIS students apply to universities globally without separate entrance exams such as the SAT or JEE. ""The ATAR consolidates certification and university eligibility. It's one system for both. Students also become eligible for a Premier's Bursary of AUD 20,000 if they choose to study in Western Australia,"" he added.The curriculum incorporates seven general capabilities: literacy, numeracy, ICT, ethical understanding, civic and social responsibility, critical & creative thinking, and intercultural understanding.",Western Australia's WACE has become the first foreign govt-backed school board to begin operations in India.

Government asks states to adhere to timelines after launch of Waqf portal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-asks-states-to-adhere-to-timelines-after-launch-of-waqf-portal/articleshow/121683840.cms,"NEW DELHI: Only properties registered as waqf with the state boards will be able to upload their details for verification and get a 17-number unique ID on the new Central Waqf Portal launched by govt on Friday. This also applies to “waqf by user” properties that existed prior to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025 coming into force on April 8.Sharing that there were over 9 lakh waqf properties in India, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju asserted that states should follow the timelines strictly and the boards must ensure that details of all waqf properties registered with them are uploaded on the portal within the stipulated 6 months.“All old properties that are in keeping with the law — titled and legitimate — will get included. Those that are illegal and without any documents will not get included. New waqf properties that get created going forward will be included in the database,” Rijiju said.According to officials, waqf properties that are not registered will need to approach their waqf boards to complete the process of registration. In the case of properties whose details are uploaded but which fail to get validated on the portal, there will be the option to approach the waqf tribunal for redressal.On what happens to properties which have supposedly been used as waqf but lack documents to prove so, Rijiju said: “Such waqf properties that do not have adequate documents but which are recognised socially and by govt and are working, we are not declaring them illegal. The issues are only with those kinds of properties which have been acquired forcefully, fraudulently, or do not have proper supportive documents or provisions. Moreover, the law does not prevent anyone from performing any religious rituals....”He, however, emphasised that going forward all waqf properties will need to fix whatever is missing in their documentation in order to come on board.On the portal, the entry of property details by the Mutawalli (caretaker) will be followed by validation by waqf boards and approval by designated govt authorities, after verification of records, to enable its entry into the ‘UMEED’ (Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act 1995) portal.For the wide-ranging details related to any property, the portal also requires the Muttawali to give a declaration before uploading them. This includes questions like “have you failed to maintain regular accounts for two consecutive years or submit for two consecutive years the yearly statement of accounts as per law; have you been convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment of less than two years; and are you part of any unlawful organisation under UAPA”.Key features of the portal include creation of a digital inventory with geo-tagging of all waqf properties, online grievance redressal system, transparent leasing and usage tracking, integration with GIS mapping and public access to verified records and reports.Pointing out that there was no stay on the law by the judiciary, Rijiju stressed that the portal in no way violates the law or the Constitution. The minister was responding to All India Muslim Personal Law Board's statement that it will challenge the legal validity of the portal in the Supreme Court where the law is under scrutiny.",Only properties registered as waqf with the state boards will be able to upload their details for verification and get a 17-number unique ID.

I will fight my way in court.”He said: “I told FM Arun Jaitley before leaving for the airport and then I flew from Delhi to London on the way to Geneva for a meeting which was fixed months ago. I told the then finance minister because I went from Parliament to Delhi airport. When this news hit the media, once again, it created a storm.People went running to Mr Jaitley. He denied meeting me. A Congress MP saw us and then said to the media ‘No, I saw them together’. Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.","Vijay Mallya says he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.

The men were held on charges of cheating and forgery, after police recovered 21 debit cards, 30 cheque books, and six PAN cards issued under different names. Their arrest followed a routine vehicle check in Surat’s Udhna area, where an associate was caught carrying fake PAN cards and firm stamps.“We found the trio had opened 165 bank accounts using documents of people who had applied for personal loans. They gave access to the criminals for cyber crimes including digital arrest, hawala transfer, task fraud, betting, stock market fraud, online cheating and OTP fraud,” Desai said.According to Desai, the accused got in touch with cyber gangs based in Cuba, Thailand, and Malaysia through the messaging app Telegram. In exchange for access to the accounts, they were offered handsome commissions.“We have so far received details of 89 of these 165 accounts from the bank.All identified accounts have since been frozen after victims lodged complaints,” Desai said.The police believe the fraudsters used a clever trick to get the bank accounts opened, approaching people applying for personal loans and taking their documents, claiming they could help secure the funds.After opening an account using those documents, they would return the papers to the applicant, saying the loan was rejected.“Since they used to give their own mobile number to get an OTP, the applicant never realised that a bank account had been opened in their name,” Desai explained.""Initially, the gang would lease out each account for a one-time fee of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 17 lakh. As their operations grew, they began charging a 3% to 4% cut of every transaction routed through the accounts. In just six months, the three accused earned Rs 10 crore from commission as the transactions in each of these accounts used to continue all day.

NEW DELHI: A new toolkit developed by The George Institute for Global Health (GIGH), India, in collaboration with Rutgers University, US and other international partners, promises to reshape India’s response to malnutrition by helping map and understand its complex food environments.The study, published in Current Developments in Nutrition, addresses how availability, affordability, and access to food influence nutritional outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India.The GIGH is an independent medical research organisation with a focus on improving the health of millions worldwide, particularly those living in disadvantaged settings. Established in 1999 and headquartered in Sydney, it operates major research centres in India, China, and the UK.Led by Shauna Downs of Rutgers and featuring Suparna Ghosh-Jerath from The George Institute, the research introduces a “Food Environment Toolbox” that includes seven practical tools such as participatory mapping and market assessments. These tools were piloted across rural, urban, and peri-urban areas in India and Cambodia.India’s food landscape is shifting rapidly, with growing market dependence not matched by better nutrition.“We developed the toolbox through an iterative process, ensuring it reflects the realities of LMICs,” said Dr. Ghosh-Jerath. The country continues to battle a double burden—widespread nutrient deficiencies alongside rising diet-related diseases. National surveys reveal severe anaemia among women and children, underscoring the need for diet quality over mere calorie sufficiency.The new toolkit could enhance key nutrition schemes like POSHAN Abhiyaan, ICDS, and the Mid-Day Meal Scheme by aligning them more closely with regional food realities. “The tools were adaptable across diverse contexts,” noted Dr. Downs, calling them a “timely step toward more effective, evidence-based nutrition policy.”","A new toolkit developed by The George Institute for Global Health (GIGH), India, promises to reshape India’s response to malnutrition.

Government to map NEETs by age in labour survey for targeted skilling push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-map-neets-by-age-in-labour-survey-for-targeted-skilling-push/articleshow/121680551.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: The Government is planning to track NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) youth by age in the labour survey for smarter skilling policies. The ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE) has successfully pushed for the inclusion of age-disaggregated NEET data in India’s flagship labour survey — the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS).Starting July 2025, the revamped survey will include new questions to better identify and support India’s disengaged youth and adult populations. Responding to the recommendations of Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge) for skill development and entrepreneurship, ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) confirmed that new PLFS rounds will include two questions: one to track whether individuals are undergoing any training, and another to record education or training attendance for the entire 0–59 age group.“We need to know who the NEETs are—not just in absolute numbers, but in terms of age brackets, vulnerability, and skill needs,” Chaudhary wrote in a letter dated February 5 to MoSPI.While the term ""NEET"" has long been used to describe those slipping through the cracks of the education and employment systems, it has rarely been dissected beyond a general statistic. This is seen as crucial for how India plans, executes, and evaluates its skilling strategies.Responding to his Chaudhary's request, Rao Inderjit Singh, minister of state (independent charge), MoSPI confirmed on May 19 that new PLFS rounds will include two questions: one to track whether individuals are undergoing any training, and another to record education or training attendance for the entire 0–59 age group. The design was cleared after consultation with expert committees and MSDE to ensure methodological consistency.According to a senior MSDE official, the reform aligns with SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth and is critical for initiatives like Skill India Digital Hub and Apprenticeship Embedded Degree Programmes.Even a 1% shift in NEET status impacts over 2.6 million youth, and now, India is set to know exactly who and where they are.","The Government is planning to track NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) youth by age in the labour survey for smarter skilling policies.

1st passenger train to Srinagar on Saturday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-passenger-train-to-srinagar-on-saturday/articleshow/121659886.cms,"LUCKNOW: Neetu Sapra has bittersweet memories of the 14 years she spent in J&K since 1997.""No quarters, peak insurgency, Kargil War - it was a roller coaster,"" she says of life in a CRPF camp in Srinagar with a two-year-old son and a railway officer husband handling a project as fraught with danger as it was technically daunting. ""On a shopping trip to Lal Chowk in 1998, we narrowly escaped a bomb blast. The USBRL shaped us as much as we shaped it.""Neetu's story is intertwined with the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) that PM Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate Friday, marking the physical bridging of what was once considered a geographical implausibility: seamless rail connectivity from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.""Wives of all railway personnel associated with USBRL would have similar stories to tell,"" says Neetu, whose husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.Sapra was posted in Udhampur when former PM H D Deve Gowda laid USBRL's foundation stone in Udhampur in early 1997. Many thought the task of carving a route through the undulating, terrorist-infested terrain was a fanciful idea.By April that year, India had a new PM in I K Gujral, and a second foundation ceremony was soon planned in Srinagar for the Qazigund-Baramulla section.Sapra recalls receiving an official note from his senior colleague Sandeep Gupta - the executive engineer assigned to lead the 13-strong technical team - to proceed to Srinagar for the July 12, 1997, event.With the odds as steep as the Pir Panjal, the team got cracking. ""Srinagar was synonymous with militancy. Nobody was prepared,"" Gupta, who retired as USBRL's chief administrative officer in Feb this year, writes in the 2009 TOI coffee table book, 'Linking Paradise: A Northern Railway Project'.""We had no choice but to dive in. This was bigger than us,"" he writes in the book, remembering how his team got by erratic phone and electricity connections and an inadequate number of vehicles.Sapra's trip to Srinagar from Udhampur to lay the ground for the foundation ceremony prepared him for what lay ahead.""Just 13km beyond Udhampur, we dodged the possibility of death by a few metres as a landslide occurred in front of our eyes. The national highway was blocked for 48 hours."" A week later, Gupta joined them, reaching Srinagar on a rickety van. A team from CRPF's 69th battalion was then occupying the railway-owned holiday home in Srinagar's Tulsi Bagh, leaving Gupta's team to cram into four dingy rooms within the complex.""We had only candles for light and hauled water in buckets from CRPF tankers,"" says Sapra, currently principal executive director in the Research Design and Standards Organisation in Lucknow.Living conditions and logistics remained a challenge throughout. The state power department refused to restore electricity to the railway facility, citing unpaid bills throughout a decade of unrest. It took several meetings with the then divisional commissioner of Kashmir, SL Bhat, for power supply to be restored. Mudassara, the PA to DoT's then general manager, intervened to provide landlines.On Nov 12, 1997, a railway survey team comprising two officers, three junior engineers and six helpers reached Nowgam (later named Srinagar railway station) on a cloudy, uneasy morning. Locals mistook them for a police raid party, causing an already tense situation to almost spiral out of control.""I had butterflies in my stomach due to sheer anxiety and fear,"" Gupta recalls in his essay.Every day, a road-opening party would set out ahead of the railway survey team to detect and defuse potential mines. After spending weeks studying topography sheets and working out other details, Gupta and Sapra drove the first two wooden pegs into the ground to mark the project's first alignment.""It felt like we had planted a dream,"" recalls Sapra.As winter took hold, the survey covered Pampore and Kakapora. The first snowfall of 1997 came on Nov 27. Work had to be halted by Dec 15. The team would return next April to resume work.""On our off days, we hunted for vegetarian food in Srinagar. However, the CRPF wasn't happy about our venturing out of the railways complex,"" reminisces Gupta.While surveying Anantnag, the team would run into surrendered militants still carrying AK-47s. ""They looked intimidating, but didn't do us harm; in fact, they seemed encouraging,"" says Gupta.By Oct 31, 1998, the Qazigund-Baramulla survey report was ready. The railway team didn't just beat the odds; they completed the task ahead of schedule.After the Baramulla-Qazigund section, Sapra and his colleagues were asked to survey the proposed Katra-Qazigund stretch. That was in 2001. The then rail minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation for this portion two years later.""During the survey, we closely observed how difficult life was for people of the Valley. Pregnant women, critically ill patients and elderly people would be brought down from hilly terrain on makeshift palanquins as there were no roads. Mules and horses were the only modes of transport to ferry goods,"" recalls Sapra.Just when things seemed to be going well, tragedy struck on June 25, 2004, when IRCON engineer R N Pundhir and his brother were kidnapped and killed by terrorists at Sugan in Shopian. ""It was a jolt. Work paused. But buoyed by local sympathy and police support, the railway men restarted with the same zeal,"" writes Bhanu Prakash, the then deputy chief engineer of USBRL, in his memoir.The first trial run in Oct 2008, from Budgam to Kakapora, was a milestone in more ways than one. A Hindu priest, a Muslim cleric and a Sikh granthi presided over prayers before the train rolled in at 30kmph. ""Locals lined the tracks and children skipped school to see the trial run. Even the cattle seemed puzzled!"" recounts Bhanu.By the time the Qazigund-Baramulla section was commissioned in 2009, tracks were ready for trains to run at speeds of up to 100kmph.Built at a cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, including a parallel highway, the 272km rail route has 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, including the world's highest, the Chenab Bridge.The rail route promises all-weather connectivity, slashing the 800km Delhi-Srinagar journey to under 13 hours.This isn't just a story of steel tracks, concrete arches and staggering statistics. USBRL is an odyssey of workers and officials fighting the elements, braving the threat of guns, and enduring separation from their families to finally ""connect"" Kashmir to the rest of India.",The Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) will be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on Friday.

'Among 2025’s biggest losses': Tesla stock crash wipes out $380billion! Trump-Musk feud deals most crushing blow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/caught-in-trump-musk-crossfire-tesla-stock-sinks-amid-feud-380bn-wiped-out-among-2025s-biggest-losses/articleshow/121687721.cms,"Tesla share price volatile after Trump-Musk feud



What’s gone wrong between Musk & Trump?



What analysts say about the Trump-Musk rift?



What's the next major deal for Tesla ?



The unlikely political marriage between US President Donald Trump and Tech billionaire Elon Musk has ended in a fiery public divorce with Tesla's shares paying the price. The fallout began after Musk openly slammed Trump’s new tax-and-spending bill on social media. In response, Trump fired back, threatening to cut off government contracts for both Tesla and SpaceX.The political clash added to Tesla's existing troubles, including slowing electric vehicle demand and Musk’s controversial ties to far-right groups.Since January, the company has lost over $380 billion in market value, making it the biggest loser among one of the major global stocks this year.As a result, Tesla is now the worst-performing large-cap stock of the year, with its market capitalisation plunging by 29.3% to $917 billion according to Reuters report. The company, which ranked eighth globally in market value at the start of 2025, has now slipped to the tenth spot.The White House has since stepped in, reportedly arranging a call with Musk to ease tensions. Despite a small rebound in Tesla shares on Friday, the broader damage appears done.However, when a reporter asked Trump about some media reports that US president has a call scheduled with Musk, Trump said, ""You mean the man who has lost his mind?"" He added that he was ""not particularly"" interested in talking to him right now.Meanwhile, Apple has also faced a tough year, falling to the third most valuable company globally. Its $2.99 trillion market cap reflects a 20% drop this year due to slowing demand in China, AI challenges, and renewed trade tensions under the Trump administration.Tesla shares plunged 14% on Thursday, wiping out over $150 billion in market value, their biggest single-day loss on record, amid a public feud between the two business men. The clash followed Musk’s sharp criticism of Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, which proposes ending the $7,500 EV subsidy by late 2025.The selloff hit broader markets, including Destiny Tech100 Inc, which holds a significant SpaceX stake, falling 13%. Short sellers gained nearly $4 billion from Thursday’s crash, the second-largest single-day profit ever, according to Ortex.However, Tesla shares recovered some ground on Friday. At 9:40 am, the stock climbed 5.2% to $299.46, after Musk appeared open to de-escalating tensions, aligning with investor Bill Ackman’s call for peace. Reports also suggest White House aides are arranging a call with Musk to cool the rift.The Thursday crash partly erased earlier gains from Tesla’s announcement of a driverless ""robotaxi"" rollout in Austin, Texas. Still, the stock closed the week down 15%, its worst weekly performance since October 2023.Year-to-date, Tesla shares have dropped 22%, making it the worst performer among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, despite remaining the world’s most valuable automaker with a market cap of about $1 trillion. Yet its valuation, 140 times projected earnings, continues to raise concerns amid growing political risks and regulatory uncertainty.Elon Musk stepped down from his role in the Trump administration last week after pressure from Tesla shareholders. While the split seemed friendly at first, things quickly turned sour.Since his exit, Musk has openly criticised Trump’s key domestic policy—particularly the new tax bill, which he called a ""disgusting abomination"" on his social media platform, X.He argued that the bill undermines cost-cutting efforts led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a team Musk was closely involved with.In response, Trump accused Musk of being upset over the bill’s removal of electric vehicle (EV) tax incentives and claimed Musk turned against him because their once-friendly relationship no longer served his interests.During an Oval Office address, Trump voiced his displeasure on Truth Social, saying: ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!""Trump claimed he had asked Musk to leave, citing his decision to remove the EV mandate. ""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!""Musk retaliated on X, claiming credit for Trump's 2024 electoral success and criticising his ingratitude. The exchange grew more hostile when Musk referenced Trump's connection to the Epstein files, concluding with ""Have a nice day, DJT!""Elon Musk’s other companies like SpaceX and Starlink—leaders in space launches and satellite internet—are now under scrutiny because of his political ties. These businesses often rely on favorable regulatory approvals, helped by Musk’s government connections.Musk, who donated $300 million to Trump’s campaign, claimed Trump’s 2024 win would depend on his support. He later criticised Trump for being ungrateful, backed his impeachment, and warned that Trump’s global tariffs could push the economy into a recession.Tesla shares have seen major ups and downs since Musk endorsed Trump last July. The stock jumped on hopes of reduced regulation for robotaxis but later dropped due to weak sales and backlash over Musk’s political involvement.Some analysts believe the Trump-Musk rift may not last long, as it could hurt both sides. ""It’s a junior high school fight where these best friends are now becoming frenemies,"" Dan Ives of Wedbush, a well-known Tesla supporter told Bloomberg.""It’s a Twilight Zone situation for all investors, because the last thing investors want to see is Trump go from a huge supporter of Musk and Tesla to a foe,"" he added.Meanwhile, most Congressional Republicans are backing Trump in the fallout. That’s a positive sign for the proposed bill, which could remove a key tax credit of up to $7,500 for buyers of some Tesla and other EV models by the end of this year, seven years earlier than planned.According to JPMorgan, if the bill passes, Tesla could lose about $1.2 billion in profit for the year.According to Paul Stanley of Granite Bay Wealth Management, the public disagreement between Trump and Musk increases Tesla's political and reputational risks.He notes that ongoing controversy could affect investor confidence and market stability. ""Given that inherent powers of the office of the presidency, I don't see how this could be anything but negative for Tesla and Musk,"" he said.Tesla faces a significant milestone with its robotaxi service launch scheduled for June 12 in Austin, Texas. This development is crucial for Musk's strategy to transform the company's focus towards autonomous vehicles and AI technology.Wedbush's Ives describes the upcoming robotaxi launch as the ""start of the autonomous vision and the next chapter of golden growth,"" whilst acknowledging Tesla as ""way oversold."" He advises investors to maintain patience.""I still believe that they stay friends and supporters of each other, but this is definitely a little white-knuckle period for Tesla investors,"" Ives added.","Tesla shares plunged 14% on Thursday, wiping out over $150 billion in market value. The selloff hit broader markets, including Destiny Tech100 Inc, which holds a significant SpaceX stake, falling 13%. Short sellers gained nearly $4 billion from Thursday’s crash, the second-largest single-day profit ever, according to Ortex.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121688378,imgsize-57478,width-400,resizemode-4/121688378.jpg"

Eminem vs Meta: Unauthorised use of music

What Meta said on the lawsuit

Grammy-winning rapper Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta accusing it of copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed by Eminem’s music publishing company, Eight Mile Style, accuses Meta of the ""unauthorised storage, reproduction, and exploitation"" of 243 of Eminem's songs across its platforms.As per the court documents seen by People, Eight Mile Style alleges that Meta's in-app features, such as ""Original Audio"" and ""Reels Remix,"" have actively encouraged and allowed users to incorporate Eminem's music into their video content without proper licensing or attribution. The lawsuit further claims that this has led to rapper's songs being used in millions of videos and streamed billions of times, resulting in diminished value of the copyrights and lost profits for the publisher.As reported by People, the lawsuit alleges that Meta has allowed its users to store, reproduce and exploit Eminem’s songs through features like Original Audio and Reels Remix, which enable users to incorporate music into their content without proper attribution or licensing.Eight Mile Style is seeking statutory damages of $150,000 per song, per platform (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), which could accumulate to the total sum exceeding $109 million. The publisher has also requested a jury trial and a permanent injunction to prevent Meta from future unauthorised use of Eminem's music.Meta has not yet issued a public comment directly on the lawsuit. However, a companyspokesperson told People that the company has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and the company has also been negotiating with Eight Mile Style. “Meta has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and an extensive global licensing program for music on its platforms. Meta had been negotiating in good faith with Eight Mile Style, but rather than continue those discussions, Eight Mile Style chose to sue,” said Meta spokesperson.","Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges



Also Read |

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success. Such resilience has been a major pillar in Nvidia's culture and Huang's own leadership style.Stephen Witt further discloses that Huang is motivated to a large extent by guilt. Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently. Witt clarifies that Huang's motivation is not mere ambition but also a combination of the fear of failure, paranoia among competitors, and the guilt of possibly disappointing others. This generates tremendous internal pressure that Huang leverages as an impetus to remain focused and drive Nvidia to its greatest heights.",Jensen Huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry.

Once political allies, Elon Musk and Donald Trump are now embroiled in a fierce and highly public feud that blends politics, tech, and personal grievance. What started as a disagreement over Trump’s sweeping domestic spending bill quickly escalated into a bitter war of words, with Musk unleashing a series of social media posts criticizing government waste and Trump retaliating with personal attacks and threats to sever federal ties with Musk’s companies. The fallout has been swift and dramatic, pulling in lawmakers, press secretaries, and even pop culture figures. Below is a detailed post-by-post timeline of how their alliance collapsed.Elon Musk criticizes Trump’s new tax and spending package, labelling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill” and a “disgusting abomination.”He claims the bill would undo all the savings achieved by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he recently served as an advisor.Trump reacts by sharing Musk’s earlier resignation from his government role, suggesting betrayal.Musk reposts claims that the majority of Republican voters want the bill “trimmed down,” adding a simple “Yes.”He shares an old Trump post criticizing GOP lawmakers for raising the debt ceiling, adding the comment “wise words.”Musk digs up another Trump post stating no lawmaker should be re-elected if the U.S. budget isn’t balanced, saying, “I couldn’t agree more.”Trump tells reporters he’s “very disappointed” in Musk after his repeated criticism and acknowledges the relationship may be over.He suggests a trimmed-down version of Trump’s legislation, posting: “Slim Beautiful Bill for the win.”Musk surprisingly supports cuts to electric vehicle incentives if it means reducing government spending.He disputes Trump’s claim that he reviewed the bill, stating he was “not shown the bill even once.”Musk posts that Trump wouldn’t have won the election without his help — a bold assertion.In a follow-up, Musk calls Trump ungrateful and shares a video of Trump praising him earlier in the year.Musk urges lawmakers to preserve green energy cuts but slash the “crazy spending increases” in the bill.He warns that the proposed bill would balloon the U.S. deficit to $2.5 trillion.In a short and pointed post, Musk calls to “Kill Bill,” referencing the proposed legislation.He starts a poll on X asking whether America needs a new political party.To counter Trump’s implied criticisms, Musk shares a video from 2021 claiming Tesla doesn't need EV subsidies to survive.In response to Laura Loomer, Musk amplifies the message that Trump only has a few years left, while he’ll be a force for decades.He posts an old quote from House Speaker Mike Johnson on debt concerns, captioning it: “Where is the Mike Johnson 2023!?”He claims that most of Congress passed the bill without even reading it.Musk shares a video of John Thune raising red flags about the deficit in 2020, asking, “Where is the John Thune of 2020??”He reposts a satirical Jerome Powell account that questions whether Musk or Trump is right.He again shares an old post from Speaker Johnson urging spending cuts, saying, “I super agree wi[th this].”In a sweeping rebuke, Musk claims the new budget plan would lead to national financial ruin.Trump says he asked Musk to leave the administration and revoked his EV mandate, blaming Musk’s behavior on that fallout.Trump suggests the federal government could save money by canceling contracts and subsidies for Musk’s companies.He refutes Trump’s framing, stating that the disagreement isn’t about EVs — it’s about fiscal sanity.In a stunning escalation, Musk posts that Trump is named in Jeffrey Epstein’s files.He follows up with ominous posts suggesting more revelations are coming.Rapper Ye weighs in on the feud, though the details of his position remain unclear.House Speaker Johnson breaks with Musk and defends the president’s budget proposal.Trump complains about Musk going public with his criticism during a crucial push for legislative approval.Musk makes a jaw-dropping statement, threatening to pull the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft from NASA use.He agrees with an X user advocating impeachment of President Trump over the spending bill.Tesla’s value drops 14% in a single day, wiping out $150 billion — a stark sign of the chaos caused by the feud.He blames Trump’s tariffs for putting the U.S. economy on the edge of recession.He posts a video showing Trump partying with Epstein, punctuated with a raised eyebrow emoji.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calls Musk’s post “an unfortunate episode” and blames his outrage on the bill excluding his favored policies.From ideological differences to deeply personal jabs, the feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has escalated beyond political commentary. What started as a policy disagreement has evolved into a cultural and political war, signaling a deep fracture between two of the most influential figures in America. And if their recent posts are any indication, this drama is far from over.","Elon Musk and Donald Trump are embroiled in a fierce and highly public feud that blends politics, tech, and personal grievance.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh's TDP-led govt has decided to amend labour laws to increase mandatory work hours from nine to 10 a day in all private firms and factories. The move is aimed attracting more investments and industries but has drawn fire from trade unions who argue that the move will turn workers into ""slaves"".Daily working hours were earlier capped at eight before being revised to nine about a decade ago.The N Chandrababu Naidu-led cabinet has cleared the latest amendments to the labour code.""Govt has decided to amend these sections as part of its Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) policy. The relaxation of rules will help attract more investments,"" said information and public relations minister K Pardhasaradhi.CPM state secretary V Srinivasa Rao condemned the move and demanded its withdrawal. ""The state is under pressure from central govt to amend rules to appease big industrialists. These amendments will only make the workers slaves,"" Rao alleged.He pointed out that the Andhra govt had taken this ""unfortunate decision"" when the entire workforce in the country was getting ready for a strike on July 9 against amendments to labour laws.Under Andhra Pradesh Factories Act, no adult worker shall be subject to work for more than nine hours in a day.The Act prescribes a half-an-hour interval after continuous work for five hours in the total slot of nine hours. Unions fear workers would end up putting in over 12 hours daily if the factory managements confine them two hours past the scheduled time.The Naidu-led cabinet has also decided to amend the rules related to overtime (OT) and night shifts. Women workers are now allowed night shifts. According to rules, employees are entitled to an additional paid holiday in lieu of the night shift. However, the facility will now be granted at the discretion of the management.The overtime schedule has also been increased to 144 hours from 75 hours. This means workers will be entitled to get additional wages in the form of overtime only after working 144 hours.The existing laws prohibit working in overlapping schedules to reduce the burden on the worker. However, Andhra govt has left the decision to the management.""Increasing work hours will impact overall health of workers and ultimately performance. It is not a wise move to force a human being to work more than the prescribed eight hours a day,"" Dr T Seva Kumar, a general physician, said.",Andhra Pradesh's TDP-led govt has decided to increase mandatory work hours from nine to 10 a day in all private firms and factories.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and his former influencer partner hired two male porn stars, who were flown across the country for “Freak Off” referring to sex parties, according to testimony in a Manhattan court on Friday.In the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, an anonymous witness, identified as ""Jane,"" informed the jury that she contacted the performers separately to join the couple’s “freak offs,” what she termed ""hotel nights"" during late 2021 and early 2022. She explained that the Bad Boys Records founder, whom she dated for three years until his arrest in September 2024, was attracted to the performers after viewing their content, New York Post reported.She described reaching out to ""Cabral"" and ""Antoine"" via Instagram, once whilst under the influence of ecstasy. She detailed their viewing of Cabral's content and subsequent discussions about his physical attributes.“We watched a few of Cabral’s videos back-to-back and we just started talking about Cabral and his size and everything” Jane said during Combs’ federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.The encounters involved intimate activities, with Jane performing whilst Combs observed.Subsequently, she engaged ""Antoine"" multiple times for similar arrangements, though the compensation details weren't disclosed.These activities were performed to gain Combs' approval, later evolving into virtual interactions. She stated that Combs requested explicit imagery from the performers.These encounters are crucial to the prosecution's case against the 55-year-old Combs, who faces potential life imprisonment if found guilty of the charges he denies.Jane's previous testimony detailed alleged abuse and coerced intimate encounters. She stated these sessions lasted between 24 to 30 hours from May 2021 to October 2023.The anonymous social media personality is expected to continue testifying for approximately five more days as the trial continues into its fifth week.","An anonymous witness, identified as ""Jane,"" told the jury that she contacted the performers separately to join the couple’s “freak offs,” what she termed ""hotel nights"" during late 2021 and early 2022.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.
