On World Health Day public health activists and doctors have expressed concern over the privatization of public health services and the handing over of district hospitals and health centres to private entities. They flagged the handing over of district hospitals to private entities in Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Karnataka. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), a network of organisations and individuals working on public health have submitted a memorandum to President Droupadi Murmu and chief ministers and health ministers of 18 states with several demands including an increase in funding for public health to 2.5% of the GDP, putting an end to privatization of healthcare services, strengthening and expanding the public health sector and ensuring food security, safe drinking water, employment, women safety and so on as major determinants of health.Recently, Jharkhand government announced that medical colleges will be opened in PPP (public-private partnership) mode in six districts including Deoghar, Khunti, Giridih, Jamtara and Jamshedpur. In Karnataka, it has been reported that new medical colleges will be established in the 11 districts without a government medical college--Tumakuru, Davanagere, Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Kolar, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Bengaluru Rural, Vijayapura, Vijayanagara and Ramanagaram. These are expected to be done in PPP mode. In Uttar Pradesh medical colleges have been established in Maharajganj, Shamli and Sambhal in PPP mode. The UP medical education department has stated that 16 districts qualify for a medical college in district hospitals in PPP mode. Madhya Pradesh floated tenders for starting medical colleges in 10 districts last year. The state also initiated the process to hand over 10 government-run trauma centres and 13 path labs to the private sector.JSA has asked for the universal implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act in all states and for implementing rate control and standard treatment guidelines in the private health sector. It also asked for medicines to be provided free at public facilities and for no tax on life saving essential medicines.","On World Health Day public health activists and doctors expressed concern over the privatization of public health services.

Becoming HC judge is tougher now: Less than 50% make it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/becoming-hc-judge-is-tougher-now-less-than-50-make-it/articleshow/120079912.cms,"‘Interviews give first-hand info about legal acumen’

NEW DELHI: For three decades, lawyers were virtually assured of becoming high court judges once their names were recommended by the HC collegia to the CJI-led three-member Supreme Court collegium. The success rate was 85-90% then, but now it has become much tougher as less than 50% of those recommended were cleared by the SC collegium, which subjected the persons, aspiring to become constitutional court judges, to a suitability test through interview/interaction, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Earlier, the SC collegium had a liberal scrutiny of antecedents by focusing only on the number of important cases argued by the lawyers and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) report detailing their reputation among the advocate community. Almost all the lawyers recommended by HC collegia — barring 10-15% who were dropped because of adverse IB reports or below par income signifying lack of practice — made it to the final list of names sent to the Centre for appointment.Such was the ease of scrutiny that little over a decade ago, the Supreme Court collegium had approved the appointment of a sitting CJI’s sister as a judge of a HC despite her annual income being less than Rs 1 lakh. Her appointment assured her of a judge’s pension.New Delhi: A month after becoming CJI, Justice Sanjiv Khanna in consultation with justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant decided to conduct personal interaction (interview) of the people recommended by HC collegia to understand their judicial outlook and suitability for judgeship in a constitutional court.This move became expedient, despite not being part of the procedure for appointment of HC judges devised by SC through two judgments in 1990s, given the increasing number of controversies created by few motor-mouth judges, some shocking judgments by HC judges and the issue of corruption.SC was forced to take suo motu cognisance of utterances of judges on public platform and judgments that gave skewed meaning to attempt to rape. The interaction/interview with aspiring constitutional court judges has reduced the success rate to below 50% in past few months.As many as 101 names were sent by collegia of 12 HCs – Andhra Pradesh, Allahabad, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Gujarat, Manipur, Orissa, Patna, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttarakhand. But the collegium comprising CJI Khanna, and Justices Gavai and Kant patiently interviewed all of them and finally selected only 49 of them as suitable for appointment as judges of the HC, which is less than 50% of the recommended names.“Thank God we started interviewing the candidates. It gives us first-hand information about not only the legal acumen and experience of the lawyers, but also their suitability for judgeship. It is tedious to interview candidates at length, but it makes the selection fairer,” collegium judges told TOI.","For three decades, lawyers were virtually assured of becoming high court judges.

No Yes

NEW DELHI: 'Make in India' is the mantra as global smartphone giants Apple and Samsung look to re-calibrate worldwide production to blunt the impact of Donald Trump's higher tariffs on China and Vietnam, when shipping to the US.Even though it is a logistical challenge with major customs and other regulatory efforts required, the issue is being addressed on an urgent basis to ensure that supplies to the US remain competitive.Also read: Flurry of exports as firms raced to beat Trump tariffs Apple, the world's biggest electronics seller, has started to use production at India's factories to ship iPhones to the US, with plans to drastically cut down exports from China. The decision is being taken as Trump has announced a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian exports to the US, while it is 54% for China, including the 34% announced last week, and 46% for Vietnam.""India's factories will be increasingly used to ship only to the US. Demand in other markets such as Europe, Latin America and even Asia will now be catered to from the China factories.

The latter had acquired the assets of Wistron and Pegatron - both from Taiwan - over the past few years. ""If Apple does not go for developing all-new production zones in locations, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, or in Brazil - all of which have US tariffs of 10% - then there will be a significant expansion of capacity in India,"" the official said.Any such move will see major investments by both Foxconn and Tatas, which could see iPhone shipments to the US grow massively from the estimated $10 billion this fiscal. A lot will, however, depend on discussions between the US with other countries.In case of Samsung, the matter is equally serious as its manufacturing set-up in Vietnam has exports of around $55 billion. ""Samsung will find it better to ship from India at a duty of 26% than export from Vietnam. While this will be a temporary measure till the Vietnamese govt negotiates with the US, it adds a lot of importance to Make in India,"" the official added.

'Will do everything to restore your dignity'

Bengal board moves SC seeking 'modification' of order

NEW DELHI: It is BJP versus Mamata Banerjee once again in battleground West Bengal. Months after the fierce faceoff over the R G Kar incident, the bitter political rivals are back on the streets - this time over the school jobs case as they try to corner each other over the loss of jobs of 25,753 teachers and staffers in state-run and aided schools in West Bengal.On April 3, a bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar found that the West Bengal School Service Commission's selection process of 2016 was based on large-scale manipulations and fraud.""In our opinion, this is a case wherein the entire selection process has been vitiated and tainted beyond resolution. Manipulations and frauds on a large scale, coupled with the attempted cover-up, have dented the selection process beyond repair and partial redemption. The credibility and legitimacy of the selection are denuded"", the apex court bench stated in its judgement.While the BJP has gone all out to corner the Trinamool government for the mess, Mamata has been quick to unleash a counter offensive. “Was there some sort of game behind the verdict? Who had played the game from behind?” the chief minister questioned while addressing a gathering of job losers at Netaji Indoor Stadium in central Kolkata on Monday afternoon. In a bid to woo the affected teachers, the Trinamool chief also made an emotional pitch as she announced that she would continue fighting for the sacked teachers as long as she is alive - even if it meant going to the jail.In a clear message to the opposition, Banerjee alleged that a “dirty game” was being played to destroy the state's education system. “A dirty game is being played by some people. One should figure out the real faces behind the masks. Many are trying to mislead people with false information,” she said.Without naming the party, Mamata lashed out at senior advocate and CPM leader Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya for initiating the legal proceedings that culminated in the Supreme Court verdict.This as the BJP MLAs mounted pressure on Mamata and accused her TMC government of corruption. Leader of opposition in state assembly Suvendu Adhikari accused Mamata's nephew of taking a bribe of Rs 700 crore.""Mamata Banerjee should go to jail. She is the main beneficiary. Her nephew took a bribe of Rs 700 crore,"" the BJP leader said at a protest of party MLAs.Bengal BJP leader and Union minister of state for education Sukanta Majumdar accused Mamata of ruining the state's education system and demanded that she be jailed. ""Mamata Banerjee has ruined the education system of West Bengal. The next 10 generations will suffer and Mamata Banerjee is responsible for this and she should be put behind bars,"" the BJP leader said.""So many people have lost their jobs. Who is responsible for this? It is Mamata Banerjee and her Cabinet. Did she ever admit that her leaders were the ones who were doing the corruption? If she were sincere, she should have thrown out those who were involved in corruption. But you are involved in this, that is why you are trying your best to save them,"" he said.Aware of the adverse fallout of the BJP's campaign, Mamata has assured full support to eligible candidates who lost school jobs and asserted that her government will ensure they don't remain jobless or have a break in service.The chief minister urged the affected teachers and staff to return to their respective schools and “voluntarily” resume duties. She assured the aggrieved teachers that she would make alternative arrangements for all deserving candidates “within two months”.“You can return to your schools and voluntarily resume teaching. You are still in service since no termination letter has been served to you yet. Our government is duty-bound to ensure that no deserving candidate loses a job. We have plans ready to ensure that the eligible candidates do not face any break in service. We will not allow them to remain jobless,” Banerjee said at the meeting at the Netaji Indoor Stadium here, where thousands of affected teachers had turned up.“I will stand by those who lost their jobs in an unjust manner. I don't care what others think. I will do everything to restore your dignity,” Mamata added.Banerjee appealed to the aggrieved teachers to “trust” the government in doing its job, and said there should be no face-offs between the “deserving” and “tainted” candidates.The chief minister also claimed that her name was being dragged into something about which she had “no inkling”, referring to discrepancies in the school job appointments. “I am ready to even go to jail if anyone wants to penalise me for standing with those who lost school jobs,” Banerjee asserted.“One should figure out the real faces from the masks because many are now trying to mislead people with false information. There is a conspiracy to break the entire education system. A dirty game is being played by some people,"" she said, in an apparent reference to the opposition BJP and the CPM.However, not all were convinced with Mamata's assurances. Some of them expressed dissatisfaction and claimed that no concrete guarantees were provided regarding reinstatement of their jobs.Meanwhile, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking 'modification' in its order annulling over 25,000 jobs in schools last week, a high-level source in the education department said here.In an appeal to the apex court, the Board's lawyer requested that either ""deserving"" candidates be allowed to attend their duties till the end of this academic year, or till a fresh recruitment process as directed by the court is completed, whichever is earlier, the source said.With assembly elections in the state next year, the opposition, especially the BJP, will continue to raise the pitch on behalf of the affected teachers. However, unlike the R G Kar incident when Mamata took a long time to meet with the protesting doctors, the Trinamool chief this time around appears to be more proactive in trying to ensure that the BJP does not steal the advantage and put her on the dock once again.(With inputs from agencies)",Mamata Banerjee says she will fight for the sacked teachers as long as she is alive. BJP MLAs mount pressure on Mamata and accuse her TMC government of corruption.

We pleaded repeatedly but were not allowed in,"" she said, describing their unsuccessful attempts to enter the examination hall.Parent Anil Kumar noted that a brief five-minute allowance from the examination centre could have prevented his daughter from missing the examination and potentially losing an academic year.Kumar expressed that while CMs and deputy CMs are temporary, the situation could have been better managed if police had communicated with the examination centre for a brief extension.Despite arriving at 8.32 am, Kumar's daughter was refused entry for being two minutes late.A parent spoke to the media, requesting Kalyan to consider arranging a re-examination for the affected students.Visakhapatnam police released a statement rejecting any link between the convoy movement and students' tardiness.""It is clear that the Deputy CM's movement through the area at 8.41 am has no connection to the late arrival of students, who were expected to report by 7 am and certainly before 8.30 am,"" the police said.The police additionally noted that examination attendance was particularly high that day.""Moreover, no traffic was blocked on the BRTS road or the service roads between Gopalapatnam and Pendurthi at any time before 8.30 am to ensure the free movement of examinees to the examination centre, which is located next to a service road,"" the police added.The Janasena founder visited the Araku constituency on Monday to meet tribal communities and initiate several road construction projects.","Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan's convoy not only disrupted the traffic but also damaged the careers of over 25 students.

NEW DELHI: The government on Monday increased the price of LPG by Rs 50 per cylinder.Union petroleum minister Hardeep Puri said that the price of cylinder will go from Rs 500 to Rs 550 for Ujwalla scheme beneficiaries and Rs 803 to Rs 853 for general users.""The price per cylinder of LPG will increase by Rs 50. From 500, it will go up to 550 (for PMUY beneficiaries) and for others it will go up from Rs 803 to Rs 853. This is a step which we will review as we go along. We review these every 2-3 weeks,"" Puri said.""Therefore, the excise duty that you have seen increase is not to go on to the consumer on petrol and diesel. That excise increase is intended to compensate the oil marketing companies for Rs 43,000 crore that they have incurred as a loss on the gas part of it,"" he added.Puri said that the hike on LPG will be reviewed after every 15-30 days.""This Rs 50 increase per cylinder will be for the Ujjwala beneficiary and overall for the non-Ujjwala beneficiary as well. This will be reviewed after every 15-30 days. In the case of petrol and diesel, if this trend remains, then the price is likely to be revised.""This comes after the government increased excise duty by Rs 2 each on petrol and diesel. According to a notification released by the revenue department of ministry of finance, the excise duty on petrol was increased to Rs 13 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 10.However, the ministry of petroleum said that the retail prices will not be effected by the hike.",The price of cylinder will go from Rs 500 to Rs 550 for Ujwalla scheme beneficiaries and Rs 803 to Rs 853 for general users.

"India 3rd largest generator of electricity from wind, solar in 2024; AI, EVs and data centres increase global electricity demand: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-3rd-largest-generator-of-electricity-from-wind-solar-in-2024-ai-evs-and-data-centres-increase-global-electricity-demand-report/articleshow/120072255.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: The constant rise in wind and solar power generation in India enabled the country to surpass Germany as the world’s third-largest generator of electricity from these sources in 2024, shows a report by global energy think-tank Ember.Though India’s generation capacity from wind and solar — 215 terawatt-hour (TWh) — in 2024 remained much lower than China, the largest generator of electricity from these sources (1,826 TWh), and the US, the second largest generator (757 TWh), it almost doubled over five years, reflecting no signs of slowing down of clean energy growth in the country despite it being a late entrant in these segments of renewables.The report released on Tuesday underlined that the increasing use of electricity for AI, data centres, electric vehicles and heat pumps is already contributing to global demand growth. “Combined, growing use of these technologies accounted for a 0.7% increase in global electricity demand in 2024, double what they contributed five years ago,” it said.The analysis found that the world reached a new milestone last year as all low-carbon sources — renewables and nuclear — provided nearly 41% of the world’s electricity generation in 2024, passing the 40% mark for the first time since the 1940s.In comparison, India generated 22% of its electricity from clean sources last year, with hydropower as the single largest contributor at 8% of the mix, while wind and solar made up 10%. “While India’s clean generation continues to grow, it remains below the global average, highlighting significant potential for further expansion,” the report said.Gobally, renewables were the main driver of overall growth, adding a record 858 TWh in 2024, 49% more than the previous high in 2022. Solar was the largest contributor for the third year running, adding 474 TWh last year. The report showed that solar was the fastest-growing power source (29%) for the 20th year in a row. Global solar generation, in fact, doubled in three years.“Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition. Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world’s ever-increasing demand for electricity,” Ember’s managing director Phil MacDonald said.The analysis also found that, despite the rise in renewables, fossil generation saw 1.4% increase in 2024 due to surging electricity demand, pushing global power sector emissions up 1.6% to an all-time high.It noted that heat waves were the main driver of the rise in fossil generation, mainly through additional use of cooling. “Without these temperature effects, fossil generation would have risen by only 0.2%, as clean electricity generation met 96% of the demand growth not caused by hotter temperatures,” the report said.During severe heat waves across the plains (April-June) last year, India’s electricity demand rose 10.4% compared to the same period in 2023. Increased air conditioning as a result of hotter temperatures accounted for nearly a third of the increase.Overall, India’s electricity demand grew by 5% in 2024. Clean generation met 33% of the increase in electricity demand, with coal meeting the majority (64%). However, this was significantly lower than in 2023, when coal met 91% of the increase.","Wind and solar power generation in India enabled the country to surpass Germany as the world’s third-largest generator of electricity from these sources in 2024.

According to the prosecution, Gupta and Kropha did not check applications in terms of coal ministry guidelines, which was a major lapse.The prosecution also alleged that they deliberately overlooked apparent discrepancies and changes in application format to favour the company. They did so despite the company claiming net worth of 28 group companies, whereas the guidelines made no mention of group firms, the prosecution alleged.Advocate Rahul Tyagi, appearing for Gupta and Kropha, countered the arguments and said they took all steps required to fairly carry out the allocation of coal blocks. Meanwhile, another court of special judge Arun Bhardwaj discharged former CBI additional legal adviser K Sudhakar, former RS MP Vijay Darda and son, and former junior Union coal minister Santosh Bagrodia from charges of corruption and criminal conspiracy in coal block allocations.","A Delhi court has discharged former coal secretary HC Gupta and ex-joint secretary K S Kropha in a coal scam case.

Amidst the ongoing global market turmoil in 2025, one billionaire who stands out in the top 15 richest persons in the world is Warren Buffett . At a time when investors around the world are reeling from the stock market crash, one billionaire whose net worth has actually grown is Buffett.According to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index data, of the top 15 richest people in the world, Warren Buffet is the only one to have seen an increase in his net worth.

From country roots to business mogul: How Taylor Swift built her billion-dollar empire

Taylor Swift has officially joined the elite club of billionaires in 2025, solidifying her status not just as a global pop phenomenon but also as a masterful businesswoman. According to Forbes’ latest World’s Billionaires list, Swift now boasts a net worth of $1.6 billion—largely thanks to her record-shattering Eras Tour and savvy control over her musical empire.While other stars like Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, and Rihanna made headlines for their ventures into beauty, fashion, and media, Taylor Swift’s rise is unique. She didn’t build her wealth through brand endorsements or business acquisitions alone—she did it with songwriting, performing, and reclaiming her artistry. Her 2023–2024 Eras Tour alone grossed over $2 billion across 149 shows in 21 countries, making it the highest-grossing tour in history.With 13 albums hitting No. 1—including “Reputation,” “Midnights,” and “1989 (Taylor’s Version)”—Swift’s music is not just topping charts but also generating massive revenue streams from sales, streaming, and licensing deals. Unlike many of her peers, Swift owns the masters of her re-recorded albums, giving her a larger slice of the financial pie than most artists ever see.Swift’s journey began in country music, but her evolution into a genre-blending global superstar came with equally strategic business acumen. Her re-recording campaign was not just a statement of artistic independence—it turned into a billion-dollar blueprint. Beyond music, Swift has leveraged her influence with precision, keeping endorsements minimal and instead turning her image into a brand of authenticity.In a testament to her character, Swift recently donated $5 million toward relief efforts for Hurricanes Milton and Helene, underscoring her belief in using wealth for meaningful impact.Even as billionaires like Kim Kardashian dominate fashion with SKIMS and Rihanna with Fenty Beauty, it’s Swift who is now being compared to moguls like Oprah and Jay-Z. Her business approach, built on integrity, ownership, and creativity, sets her apart.Also Read: Sadie Sink finally breaks silence on age-gap controversy in Taylor Swift's All Too Well short film In a list filled with actors, reality stars, and entrepreneurs, Swift remains a standout—proof that artistic integrity, combined with a relentless work ethic, can be just as powerful as boardroom deals.","According to Forbes’ latest World’s Billionaires list, Taylor Swift now boasts a net worth of $1.6 billion.

Key highlights

Soma Das, a cancer survivor and teacher, is the only one among 25,753 teachers whose job was spared after the Supreme Court upheld the Calcutta High Court's decision to scrap the appointments of the others due to a job scam.

Despite her personal relief, Soma Das expressed sorrow over the impending job losses of her colleagues, emphasizing that their struggle for employment was also her battle.

Das highlighted the failure of the School Service Commission in providing proper documentation, which contributed to the situation affecting many deserving teachers who were qualified for their positions.

KOLKATA: Under normal circumstances, Soma Das would have been happy and relieved after the Supreme Court's SSC verdict. But she is not.The cancer survivor is the sole teacher (among the 25,753) whose job is not on the chopping block after the apex court on Thursday upheld the Calcutta High Court decision to scrap appointments of 25,752 teachers. Das was exempted on ""humanitarian grounds"" both by the HC and the SC. It might be a personal relief for her, but she is not happy as two of her colleagues are set to lose their jobs.

Das, who now teaches at Modhura High School in Birbhum, told TOI over the phone.""I cracked the exam based on merit, and my name was on the merit panel.

"'Don’t sell, just hold': Jim Cramer advises investors amid swinging US market",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dont-sell-just-hold-jim-cramer-advises-investors-amid-swinging-us-market/articleshow/120068988.cms,"Jim Cramer (Pic credit X/ @jimcramer)

Market commentator and CNBC host Jim Cramer-- who warned that a potential market crash could be the worst one-day decline since 1987's "" Black Monday ,""-- urged long-term investors to stay the course amid the market turmoil caused by President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff announcement.Speaking on Squawk on the Street Thursday, Cramer advised investors to maintain their positions, emphasizing that, like during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the market would eventually recover.In 1987, US stock market plunged over 22% in a single day.“If you were OK in 2007 and 2008, it came back,” Cramer said, referencing the market’s recovery after the financial crisis, as per CNBC report.He acknowledged that it took until 2013 for investors to recoup their losses but insisted that those with a long-term outlook shouldn’t panic. “If you need your money now, such as retirees or those nearing retirement, you’re in limbo,” Cramer added, but emphasized, “Don’t sell, just hold.”Reflecting on the current market drop, Cramer described it as a ""price-to-earnings ratio lowering event,"" suggesting that the decline is offering buying opportunities for savvy investors. He said, “Once that happens, then I think you really have to start thinking, ‘That’s interesting.’ It will get there.” Cramer noted that the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio is just above 20, down from a trailing P/E ratio closer to 25.Cramer also shared a personal anecdote, recalling the advice he gave during the financial crisis. “In 2007, I went on the ‘Today’ show and said, ‘If you need any money in the next five years, you should sell.’ That was a great call,” he said.But Cramer also reflected on his later advice during the market’s recovery, when he famously bought at the “Haines bottom,” a moment credited to late CNBC anchor Mark Haines, who called the market bottom on March 10, 2009.While Cramer emphasized the difficulty of timing the market, he highlighted the danger of remembering only the sell call from such moments, not the buy call when the market was poised to rebound. ""You have to be right twice: first on the sale, and second when you repurchase at the bottom,"" Cramer cautioned.His advice remained clear: Investors should not panic, but instead, view the market’s current volatility as a potential buying opportunity in the long run.","CNBC host Jim Cramer urged long-term investors to stay the course amid the market turmoil caused by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcement.

Trump scolds China

Global markets hit hard

US stock markets joined the global market selloff on Monday, with S&P 500 plunging 4%. S&P 500 saw its poorest performance since the COVID-induced economic crisis in March 2020. Markets are experiencing dramatic fluctuations as investors evaluate the implications of President Donald Trump 's international trade policies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average demonstrated extreme volatility, initially plummeting 1,700 points before surging 800 points higher, and subsequently declining 414 points. As of 1:33 pm, GMT-4, Dow Jones was trading at 332 point below the previous closure.The S&P 500 displayed similar erratic behaviour and fell 1.3% during the first trading hour, whilst the Nasdaq composite decreased by 0.8%. These movements mirror worldwide market declines as concerns intensify regarding the impact of Trump's trade policies on global economic stability. As of 1:38 PM GMT-4 on April 7, the Nasdaq Composite is trading at 15,634.50, up 46.71 points (0.30%) from the previous close of 15,587.79. Also, the S&P 500 is at 5,072.75, down by 1.33 points (0.026%) from the previous close of 5,074.08 at 1:40 PM.The S&P 500, a crucial component of numerous investors' 401(k) retirement portfolios, has declined by over 20% from its peak established less than two months ago. Should the S&P 500 close below this threshold, the decline would qualify as what financial experts term a ""bear market"".This classification indicates a more severe downturn than the typical 10% correction that occurs annually, representing a more significant economic concern.Stock markets around the world are bleeding due to US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement, which has stoked fears of a global recession, including in the US. The downward trend drove Nasdaq into bear market territory during the previous week, with S&P 500 and Dow Jones approaching similar levels. A bear market occurs when values decrease by 20 percent from their recent highest point.Ahead of the US stock market opening, Trump asked people not to be weak. ""The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done decades ago. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a Panican (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!"" he said on social media.European and Asian markets experienced sharp declines, whilst S&P 500 index futures declined 2.7% during premarket trading. The index had fallen 17.4% from its February peak by the close of the previous week. Market analysts typically classify a decline of 20% or more from a recent peak as a bear market, according to an AP report.Crude oil prices continued their downward trend, momentarily falling under $60 per barrel, reaching levels not seen since 2021. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased by 2.4%, whilst Nasdaq futures registered a 3% decline.Trump reaffirmed his stance on reciprocal tariffs on Sunday regarding trade deficit reduction with partner nations, indicating he would not negotiate unless this issue was addressed.""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump stated, whilst his administration remained unfazed by market volatility.Whilst aboard Air Force One, he informed journalists that international leaders were ""dying to make a deal.""Also Read | Stock market crash today: It's a bloodbath!

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

“Yeah, I shouldn’t have said that.”

For the Chicago Cubs , it is a difficult spot, as their outfielder Kyle Tucker couldn’t come on board during the winter, however, now, they are stuck in a situation and are worried because Tucker could become a free agent next year.The conversation regarding Kyle Tucker’s future with the Chicago Cubs has become a big deal, and now, until Tucker signs a new contract, it will keep the team in doubt. Recently, the Blue Jays gave Vladimir Guerrero Jr. a massive 14-year, $500 million deal. Tucker could possibly leverage his situation with his team, to look for a similar opportunity.Regarding Guerrero’s recent contract, Kyle Tucker said:As for Tucker, who said that he will “see where everything goes.""Regarding questions surrounding his contract, and the deadlines he could possibly have for himself, Tucker just shrugged, as he claimed to have no clear answer and that he’s “just here to play baseball.”Meanwhile, the Chicago Cubs’ manager, Craig Counsell claims he wishes to see Kyle Tucker in the spring training next year. He said:When asked whether Tucker will be present for Spring Training session next year, Counsell said:Kyle Tucker is off to a good start in Chicago, while batting at .327 with five homers and National League-leading 16 RBIs after going 2 for 5 and driving in a run against the Texas Rangers.Also Read: Cubs Right Fielder Kyle Tucker's Opening Day Plan Includes Trying A Traditional Dish Of Japan","Chicago Cubs outfielder Kyle Tucker could become a free agent next year.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
