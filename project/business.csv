It recorded a decline only in the 'moderately dense forest' category.Released on Thursday, the physical asset accounting showed that forest cover (very dense, moderately dense and open forest) increased from 6,97,898 sq km in 2010-11 to 7,15,342 in 2021-22, adding 17,444 sq km (2.5%) in 10 years.During the same 10-year period, 'very dense forest' (VDF) increased by 19,000 sq km (from 83,502 sq km in 2010-11 to 1,02,502 sq km in 2021-22), whereas 'moderately dense forest' (MDF) decreased by 11,071 sq km (from 3,18,745 sq km to 3,07,673 sq km). The increase was also reported in the 'open forest' category from 2,95,651 sq km to 3,05,167 sq km (3.2% increase).All lands with tree canopy density of 70% and above come under VDF, whereas lands with tree canopy density of 40% and more but less than 70% are categorised as MDF. Similarly, all lands with tree canopy density of 10% and more but less than 40% come under the 'open forest' category.State-wise data shows the highest increase of 4,137 sq km in Kerala, followed by 3,122 sq km in Karnataka and 2,606 sq km in TN in the VDF category.The forest accounting was done by ministry of statistics and programme implementation adopting the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA) Framework which is an agreed international framework for the compilation of the environment economic accounts from 2018.Besides accounting the forest physical asset, it also analysed the 'forest condition' showing the status of growing stock, carbon stock, economic value and status of regeneration. The publication claimed the condition of forests has improved in terms of biomass and carbon storage, with reduced severe degradation indicating better forest health.

"On 80-yr-old's plea, SC orders eviction of his 61-yr-old son",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-80-yr-olds-plea-sc-orders-eviction-of-his-61-yr-old-son/articleshow/124138246.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a case reflective of relationship issues that are unique to today's times, Supreme Court has come to the relief of an 80-year-old man and his 78-year-old wife and ordered eviction of their 61-year-old son from two rooms owned by the man in Mumbai after he failed to provide them with maintenance, as mandated under the Maintenance and Welfare of Senior Citizens Act, 2007.The octogenarian father and his wife had moved back to their native town in Uttar Pradesh after being pushed out of the properties - one room at Yadav Chawl in Yadav Nagar and another at Raju Estate, Bengali Chawl, Saki Naka -- by their eldest son who was running a business there.In July 2023, they filed for maintenance and eviction of their son from the said properties before the tribunal concerned, which in June last year directed the man to hand over possession of both the rooms to his parents and also provide them with a monthly maintenance of Rs 3,000. The son's challenge was rejected by the appellate tribunal. He then appealed against the eviction order in Bombay HC.The HC, on April 25, allowed the son's petition on the ground that the tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to pass an order for vacation of property against a senior citizen, the son being over 60 years old. The parents moved the SC against the HC order.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta termed the Bombay high court order erroneous and highlighted that the man was 59 years old when his parents moved the tribunal under the 2007 Act, which was enacted to address the plight of the elderly and to ensure their care and protection.""Being a welfare legislation, its provisions must be construed liberally so as to advance its beneficent purpose. This Court on several occasions has observed that the Tribunal is well within its powers to order eviction of a child or a relative from the property of a senior citizen, when there is a breach of the obligation to maintain the senior citizen,"" the bench said.Asking the son to vacate the two rooms in Mumbai and hand over their possession to his parents by Nov 30, the bench said, ""In the present case, despite being financially stable, the son has acted in breach of his statutory obligations in not allowing the parents to reside in the properties owned by the father, thereby frustrating the very object of the Act.

"School dropout rates halved in 2 years, says govt report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/school-dropout-rates-halved-in-2-years-says-govt-report/articleshow/124138112.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's school system has recorded one of its sharpest gains in recent years, with dropout rates falling significantly across all levels, according to the ministry of statistics and programme implementation's (MoSPI) Comprehensive Modular Survey: Education, 2025.The survey, conducted during April-June 2025 as part of the 80th round of the National Sample Survey, shows that dropout rates have nearly halved within just two years. At the secondary level, the rate fell to 8.2% in 2024-25 from 13.8% in 2022-23. At the middle level, it dropped to 3.5% from 8.1%, while at the preparatory stage, it declined to 2.3% compared with 8.7% earlier.This sharp improvement signals a structural turnaround in retention, suggesting that more children are staying enrolled and completing schooling. Experts link the gains to govt initiatives such as expanded mid-day meals, targeted scholarships for disadvantaged groups, better infrastructure under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, and the flexibility introduced by the National Education Policy (NEP-2020).Yet the survey also uncovers a nuanced challenge around affordability. While more children are completing school, household spending on education has risen steadily.In rural India, the average annual expenditure per student on govt schools was Rs 2,639, compared to Rs 19,554 in non-govt schools. In urban areas, the difference is sharper - Rs 4,128 in govt schools against Rs 31,782 in private unaided institutions. Overall, 57% of students reported paying course fees, with the proportion much higher in private schools.This suggests that families are stretching finances to sustain education, even as retention improves. ""Improved retention is a success, but sustaining it requires keeping education affordable. Rising costs could become the next barrier, particularly for low-income families,"" said an official with the ministry of education.The steepest improvements were seen at the preparatory and middle levels, long considered vulnerable to socio-economic pressures. That these stages now show the lowest dropout levels is being read as proof that early interventions are paying off. But the secondary stage remains fragile, where adolescents face competing demands: household income, early work, and the absence of nearby higher-secondary schools.A MoSPI official noted, ""India is steadily moving towards ensuring that every child not only enters but also completes school. The challenge now is sustaining retention at the secondary stage, where aspirations often collide with financial realities.""The MoSPI report is particularly significant because it provides fresh national-level estimates after a seven-year gap, offering policymakers vital evidence for India's push towards universal secondary education and higher Gross Enrolment Ratios. Experts argue that if the current downward trend in dropouts continues, India could achieve near-universal school completion within a decade, provided affordability and access remain central to reforms.",India's school system has recorded one of its sharpest gains in recent years. Dropout rates have nearly halved within just two years. Experts link the gains to govt initiatives such as expanded mid-day meals.

Banswara ke kisaanon ne suraj ki roshni se apne khet ki takdeer badal di hai

NEW DELHI: A farmer in Rajasthan’s Banswara on Thursday left the crowd in splits, and even drew a chuckle from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he took an indirect jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ’s viral “aalu se sona” remark.The exchange took place during the Prime Minister’s interaction with beneficiaries of the PM-KUSUM scheme, an initiative to promote solar energy in farming, during his visit to Banswara. Farmers from Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka joined the event.One local farmer, praising the scheme, said his long-cherished dream had been fulfilled through the installation of a solar plant on his land. Taking a swipe at Gandhi, he added: “The quip instantly lit up the audience, sparking laughter across the venue and a smile from PM Modi himself. BJP I-T department chief Amit Malviya also shared the clip of the exchange, saying: ""Prime Minister interacting with PM-KUSUM beneficiaries in Banswara. You just can’t miss the rustic sense of humour here"".The farmer referred to a 2017 remark attributed to Rahul Gandhi. A video that went viral on social media showed an edited version of the Congress leader supposedly saying he would install a machine that could turn potatoes into gold.However, the complete video later shared by the Congress showed Rahul Gandhi claiming that the remark had actually been made by Prime Minister Modi. The shorter clip of Rahul, with only the first part, had gone viral that year.The Prime Minister lauded the farmers of Banswara for turning to solar energy and leading the way in sustainable agriculture. “,” he remarked, highlighting how the scheme is helping farmers not only grow food but also generate and sell surplus energy.The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of Anushakti Vidhyut Nigam Ltd's (ASHVINI) Mahi Banswara Rajasthan Atomic Power Project (4X700 MW) worth around Rs 42,000 crore in line with his commitment to transform India's power sector to ensure affordable, reliable, and sustainable power supply.It will be one of the largest nuclear plants in the country, supplying reliable base load energy, and will strengthen India's position in environmental stewardship and the evolving nuclear energy landscape.Mahi Banswara Rajasthan Atomic Power Project comprises four indigenous 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors with advanced safety features, designed and developed by NPCIL.","The exchange took place during the Prime Minister’s interaction with beneficiaries of the PM-KUSUM scheme.

India ‘Of Critical Importance To US’: Marco Rubio After Meeting EAM Jaishankar On Sidelines Of UNGA

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar on Thursday, in a veiled message to US President Donald Trump, said the world cannot ignore the need for a global workforce, pointing out that many countries cannot meet labour demands from their own populations.Speaking at an event hosted by Observer Research Foundation on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Dr Jaishankar said, ""This is a reality. You cannot run away from this reality,"" adding, ""Where that global workforce is to be housed and located may be a matter of political debate. But there’s no getting away. If you look at demand and you look at demographics, demands cannot be met in many countries purely out of national demographics. ”The external affairs minister's remarks come as Indian professionals face new challenges under US President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, including a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas. Indians are the largest group using these temporary work permits.Dr Jaishankar further called for a more “acceptable, contemporary, efficient model of a global workforce” that can be spread across a distributed workplace.He said the new model will see different trade arrangements between countries. “We will see, as part of this re-engineered world, we will see countries which will make decisions which they may not have made in other circumstances, countries which today will feel the desire, sometimes even the compulsion, to have new partners and new regions,” he said.The external affairs minister stressed that trade and technology will continue to reshape international relations despite uncertainties. “For all the obstacles and complications that may arise, I also think they will be countered or mitigated… it is easier to trade today,” he said, pointing to smoother physical and digital interfaces, highlighting the success of India’s digital public infrastructure, which he said other countries find more practical than western models.Dr Jaishankar further said that in today’s global environment, countries, especially larger ones, must strengthen their capacities to become more self-reliant. He argued that multi-polarity would not emerge on its own but must be actively built through national strength and experience.",Dr S Jaishankar said the world cannot ignore the need for a global workforce.

Latest Agni-Prime test-fired from rail-based launcher,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/latest-agni-prime-test-fired-from-rail-based-launcher/articleshow/124132466.cms,"India Creates History With First Rail-Based Agni-Prime Missile Test, Has a Strike Range of 2000 Kms

NEW DELHI: India successfully tested the new-generation nuclear capable Agni-Prime ballistic missile, which has a strike range up to 2,000-km, from a rail-based launcher system for the first time on Wednesday night.With the road-mobile Agni Prime already being inducted into the tri-Service Strategic Forces Command (SFC), the specially designed rail launcher will enhance the operational flexibility, survivability and cross-country mobility of this smallest and lightest among the Agni series of ballistic missiles.“The rail launcher will allow the SFC to launch on the go with a short reaction time, along with reduced visibility to enemy forces. Rail-based launchers, for instance, can escape detection by enemy satellites by hiding in tunnels,” an official told TOI.Moreover, the Agni Prime is a canister-launch missile system like the Agni-V, the country’s most formidable missile with a strike range of over 5,000-km. In such systems, the nuclear warheads are already mated with missiles in hermetically-sealed canisters.Consequently, the canisters can be stored for longer periods without adverse weather impact, are easier to handle, and can be swiftly transported through rail or road to launch from wherever required.On Wednesday night, DRDO and SFC conducted the test of the solid-propellant fueled Agni Prime “under a full operational scenario” from the rail launcher “having the capability to move on the country’s rail network without any pre-conditions”, the defence ministry said.The missile trajectory was tracked by various ground radar stations and met all mission objectives. “This successful flight test has put India in the group of select nations which have developed canisterised launch systems from on the move rail network,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.An official, in turn, said, “The system is self-sustained and is equipped with all independent launch capability features, including the state-of-the-art communication systems and protection mechanisms.”The Agni-Prime, which incorporates new propulsion systems and composite rocket motor casings as well as advanced navigation and guidance systems, will gradually replace the Agni-I (700-km) and Agni-2 (2,000-km) in the arsenal of SFC, which also has the Prithvi-2 (350-km), Agni-3 (3,000-km), Agni-4 (4,000-km) and Agni-5 ballistic missiles.While fighters like Sukhoi-30MKI, Mirage-2000, Jaguar and Rafale can deliver nuclear gravity bombs, India is also working towards strengthening its naval leg of the `nuclear triad’ – the ability to launch nukes from the land, air and sea.The commissioning of India’s third SSBN (nuclear-powered submarine armed nuclear ballistic missiles) as INS Aridhaman will now take place early next year after some delay. The first two SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, are already fully operational.With a displacement of 7,000-tonne, the third SSBN is slightly larger than the first two and will be able to carry more K-4 missiles with a strike range of 3,500-km.While a fourth submarine is under construction under the secretive advanced technology vessel (ATV) project, there is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones, as reported by TOI earlier.",India successfully tested the new-generation nuclear capable Agni-Prime ballistic missile from a rail-based launcher system for the first time on Wednesday night.

NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry cancelled Thursday the licence issued under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 to Ladakh activist Sonam Wangchuk 's NGO, Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh, over alleged violations. Wangchuk had alleged that the govt was building a case to put him behind bars.The cancellation came hours after MHA attributed Wednesday's mob violence and arson in Ladakh to the ""provocative"" speeches made by Wangchuk with references to Arab Spring-style protests and the Gen Z outpouring in Nepal.The alleged violations include depositing locally generated funds in SECMOL's FCRA account, diversion of funds for non-permissible activities, like studying the country's sovereignty, and failure to deposit the foreign funds received in the designated FCRA account.Sources claimed even Himalayan Institute of Alternatives Ladakh (HIAL) founded by Sonam Wangchuk had received foreign remittances of over Rs 1.5 crore without FCRA registration. An amount of Rs 6.5 crore was allegedly diverted to Wangchuk's private firm Sheshyon Innovation. Sources said Wangchuk had sent Rs 2.3 crore abroad during 2021-24 from his personal account, and received Rs 1.68 crore foreign funds from 2018 to 2024 in different accounts, adding that he has nine personal bank accounts of which eight are not declared.An official said HIAL has seven accounts, of which four remain undeclared; and SECMOL nine accounts, of which six are not declared. Sheshyon has three accounts of which two are not declared. Wangchuk has been receiving huge CSR funds from corporates, including PSUs, even though he criticises them, the official said.CBI, on the request of the home ministry, is now probing the alleged violations while the income tax authorities are looking into other financial irregularities.Proceedings against SECMOL began Aug 20 with the issuance of a show-cause notice which raised the depositing of Rs 3.5 lakh by Wangchuk into SECMOL's FCRA account in 2021-22. Though SECMOL clarified that Rs 3.35 lakh were proceeds from sale of an old bus in 2015, MHA noted that the FCRA return filed by SECMOL showed Wangchuk received it as foreign donation.MHA said local funds worth Rs 54,600 were deposited in the FCRA account of SECMOL by three individuals in violation of Section 17 of the Act, which the NGO said was mistakenly transferred.An additional Rs 4.9 lakh was received from foreign donors for study on topics including sovereignty, which cannot be accepted, said MHA as it ""is against the national interest"".","Union home ministry cancels licence issued under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 to Ladakh activist Sonam Wangchuk's NGO.

What Priya Kapur has argued



NEW DELHI: What began as a story of grief and loss with the sudden death of businessman Sunjay Kapur has quickly spiraled into one of India’s most high-profile inheritance battles. When Sunjay Kapur collapsed during a polo match in Windsor this June, condolences quickly gave way to courtroom drama. His sprawling empire, nearly Rs 30,000 crore, is now at the heart of a bitter feud involving his widow Priya Sachdev Kapur, his 80-year-old mother, Rani Kapur, and his children with actor Karisma Kapoor And the claims are only getting sharper with each passing day. In the latest, lawyers for Sunjay’s teenage children Samaira and Kiaan have alleged that their father’s disclosed bank accounts had already been ""wiped clean"".Priya has however moved a plea in Delhi high court to submit her late husband’s full asset list in a sealed cover or in the alternative, constitution of Confidentiality Club. She has cited fears of leaks and misuse. The court said filing the list of personal assets and liabilities in a sealed cover may be ""problematic"" since his two children with former wife and actor Karisma Kapoor have a ""right to question the assets disclosed.The judge has directed Priya to file a complete disclosure of Sunjay’s assets and liabilities as of June 12, the day of his sudden death.Sunjay Kapur, chairman of Sona BLW Precision Forgings (Sona Comstar), was among India’s leading auto component tycoons. His profile extended beyond boardrooms: his marriages, first to designer Nandita Mahtani, then to actor Karisma Kapoor, and finally to fashion entrepreneur Priya Sachdev, kept him firmly in the public eye.The 53-year-old industrialist died suddenly on June 12 in Windsor, England, after collapsing mid-match at the prestigious Guards Polo Club. He reportedly swallowed a bee during the polo match that triggered a fatal heart attack.At the heart of the dispute is Sunjay Kapur’s estimated Rs 30,000 crore estate, comprising shares, properties, business holdings, and family trusts.Following his death, the division of assets became a legal and emotional battleground between his widow Priya, his two children with Karisma Kapoor (Samaira and Kiaan), his mother Rani Kapur, and Priya’s own child, all seeking their fair share.The matriarch of the family and widow of late industrialist Surinder Kapur, founder of the Sona Group. After her son’s passing, Rani publicly questioned Priya Sachdev Kapur’s control over Aureus Investment and opposed her appointment to the company’s board. In a letter dated July 24, she voiced strong concerns about how affairs were being managed following Sunjay’s death.: Samaira and Kiaan are Sunjay and Karisma’s children. Both live with their mother in Mumbai. Samaira and Kiaan Raj have challenged Sunjay's purported will and sought shares in his assets reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore. Priya, meanwhile, informed the court that they have already received Rs 1,900 crore from the family trust.: A year after his divorce from Karisma, Sunjay married model-turned-entrepreneur Priya Sachdev. The couple has a son, Azarias. Priya has positioned herself as the defender of both her late husband’s legacy and her son’s rightful share in the estate, but her moves have drawn resistance from both Rani Kapur and Sunjay’s children with Karisma.Sunjay Kapur’s death triggered a flurry of legal manoeuvring. In July, Sona Comstar held its Annual General Meeting (AGM), brushing aside an emotional plea from Rani Kapur to delay the proceedings.Rani Kapur, in a letter, had asked the board to postpone the AGM by two weeks. Her reason? The family was still reeling from Sunjay’s death and critical decisions about control and legacy were being rushed through behind her back. In her letter to the board and shareholders, Rani called the AGM ""insensitive,"" accusing unnamed individuals of exploiting the family's tragedy to ""wrest control"" of the company and install their preferred nominees.Sona Comstar, however, didn’t blink. In a sharply worded response, the company said the AGM was conducted in ""full legal and regulatory compliance."" It dismissed Rani Kapur’s objections, stating that she hadn’t been a shareholder ""since at least 2019.""The inheritance battle reached the Delhi high court as Karisma Kapoor's children filed a plea seeking their rightful share.At the heart of the suit is a disputed will dated March 21, 2025, which leaves Sunjay’s entire personal estate to his widow Priya Sachdev Kapur. The children have contested the will, calling it ""forged, fabricated, and surrounded by suspicious circumstances.""According to the plaint, Sunjay never disclosed the existence of such a will during his lifetime, and neither Priya nor any other family member mentioned it until after his death. The filing alleged that Priya’s conduct demonstrated ""without a doubt: that the document has been fabricated.""The children have sought partition of assets, rendition of accounts, and a permanent injunction restraining Priya from selling or encumbering the estate. They also flagged a lack of transparency, telling the court they do not have complete information about their father’s assets at the time of his passing in June 2025.Priya Kapur has denied the allegations and her lawyers have argued that there is enough evidence to show the will in question was created and executed much before her husband's death.Kapur's lawyers have also disclosed that assets worth around Rs 1,900 crore have been transferred to the plaintiff siblings and that Karisma Kapoor and Sunjay Kapur’s marriage culminated in a bitter divorce after which she was ""nowhere to be seen"".The court will resume the hearing on the matter on Friday.","Sunjay Kapur died suddenly on June 12 in Windsor, England, after collapsing mid- match at the prestigious Guards Polo Club.

While the association claimed the sum was the sale proceeds of an old bus purchased with FCRA funds and thus rightly deposited in the FCRA account, the government noted discrepancies between the transaction details in its returns and the actual bank credits, calling the explanation “untenable.”Authorities also flagged that in FY 2020-21, local contributions amounting to Rs 54,600 from three individuals were credited to the FCRA account instead of the local account, a violation admitted by the association as an “inadvertent” error.Further, SECMOL received Rs 4.93 lakh from Swedish organisation Framtidsjorden for youth-awareness programmes on migration, climate change and food security. While the NGO said the funds were used strictly for educational purposes, the ministry observed that part of the grant involved “study on sovereignty of the country,” which cannot be funded by foreign contributions under Section 12(4) of the Act.""We received RS.4,93,205/- from framstidjorden for educational program for youths under the FE project for creating awareness among youth on issues such as migration, climate change, global warming, food security and Sovereignty and organic farming through different workshops and trainings. The funds were utilized stricty in line with the organization's objectives and for the specific purposes for which they were allocated. Hence, all these activities were educational and there was no violation,"" association replied.The ministry also pointed to a Rs 19,600 foreign donation returned to a donor during the Covid lockdown and a Rs 79,200 deduction from staff stipends that was recorded as food-fee receipts instead of disbursed salaries, which it said reflected poor accounting and possible violations of Sections 18 and 19.""AND WHEREAS, in view of violations as enumerated above u/s 8(1)(a), 17,18,19 and conditions of registration under section 12(4)(f) (i) of the Act, the FCRA registration certificate of the association is liable to be cancelled in exercise of power u/s 14 of the Act,"" the statement read.""NOW THEREFORE, considering the facts and position narrated in preceding paras, the Competent Authority, hereby, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14(1) of the Act, cancels with immediate effect the FCRA Certificate of Registration No. 152710012R granted to the association ""Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh,"" the statement added.The CBI 's investigation, based on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs, began about 10 days ago when CBI officials visited the institution in Ladakh, PTI reported.Reacting to the MHA's statement, which had blamed him for provoking mob violence, Wangchuk stated that he is prepared to be arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).""To say it was instigated by me, or sometimes by Congress, is to find a scapegoat, rather than addressing the core of the problem, and this will lead us nowhere. They may be clever in making somebody else a scapegoat, but they are not wise. At this time, we all need wisdom rather than 'cleverness' because youths are already frustrated,"" Wangchuk told PTI over the phone.The activist, who has been leading the peaceful agitation for statehood and constitutional safeguards for Ladakh, also raised concerns over his personal safety.""I see they are building up a case to bring me under the Public Safety Act and throw me in jail for two years,"" he said, adding, ""I am ready for that, but Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than free Sonam Wangchuk.""Over CBI probe on his institute for alleged FCRA violation, Activist Sonam Wangchuk told ANI, ""In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk.""""A day later (after Leh protests), the Home Ministry of India issued a press release naming Sonam Wangchuk in it and blaming him... I had received a notice about a CBI inquiry stating that your organisation received foreign funding even when it did not have FCRA. We did not get FCRA because we don't want funds from abroad. United Nations team wanted to take our Passive Solar Heated Building to Afghanistan, and for this, they gave us a fee. We also got fees with tax from Switzerland and Italy organisations for supplying knowledge to them about our artificial glaciers...We are getting I-T summons. In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk,"" he added.The investigation coincides with recent unrest in Ladakh, where the protest turned the violent protests that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 over demands for statehood and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The protest took a violent turn with the BJP office and several vehicles set on fire and hundreds of people taking to the streets.The region experienced its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday, with youth groups engaging in arson and vandalism at the BJP headquarters and Hill Council, including burning vehicles. Law enforcement had to use teargas to control the situation.","The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh.

Yes, to ensure fairness and safety No, existing rules are enough





CHANDIGARH: A 73-year-old grandma, who lived in US for 30 years, ""did everything right, worked, paid tax, and never missed any immigration check date"" is heartbroken after being deported in cruel manner — denied access to even her medicines on flight and once handed a plate of ice as food during her detention.""After living there for so long, you are suddenly detained and deported this way, it is better to die than to face this. In such a situation, one should not live,"" Harjit Kaur said with anguish. Choking up while speaking to TOI on Thursday evening, she said: ""Look at my feet, they are swollen like cow dung cakes. I neither got medicine nor am I able to walk.""Kaur landed in New Delhi on Thursday afternoon and was on her way to her sister's house in Mohali when she narrated her ordeal to TOI. A native of Pangota village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago after her husband, Sukhwinder Singh, passed away.She lived in the San Francisco Bay area and worked at a cloth store in Berkeley till Jan this year when she had to quit because of complications from her knee surgeries.Kaur was taken into custody on Sept 8 during a routine check-in with immigration officials.Her asylum applications had been turned down, with the last rejection in 2012.Kaur was moved to Mesa Verde IC Processing Centre in Bakersfield. ""Despite the outrage over my detention and sympathy for me, the authorities in the US were simply unmoved,"" she said.She was flown from Georgia to Armenia and then to New Delhi, along with 132 others, many of whom were Punjabis, she said. She was the only one not shackled and handcuffed. ""I was the oldest, you see,"" Kaur said.Her lawyer in the US, Deepak Ahluwalia, put out a video narrating the 60-70 hours before her deportation flight to India. ""She was not given a bed and had to share a holding room. There was a concrete bench. She was made to sleep on the floor with a blanket. She was unable to get up when she would lie down because she had double knee replacement surgery.""Ahluwalia added, ""She would ask for food so she could take her medicines. Those requests were ignored. Not that she wasn't fed at all. She was given a cheese sandwich. When she asked again to have something or even water to take her medication, she was given a plate of ice. She explained she had dentures and could not eat them. The guard told her — ‘that's your fault'.""Kaur was even denied a shower the entire time, said the lawyer. ""Prior to the flight on Monday around 7pm, she and other detainees were given wet wipes and told to just clean up before they boarded. Throughout this entire ordeal, no food,"" he said.Ahluwalia said an officer was apparently going to cuff and shackle Kaur as they ""usually do on the plane,"" but another officer said not to because of her age. ""The point I am trying to make here is how a 73-year-old grandmother with no criminal record was treated. And everyone can keep saying she had a final order of removal and she was asked to leave. ICE has suggested in their response to media articles that she had exhausted all her appeal options. That's correct. What's completely incorrect is that she chose to stay here when her case was denied or the last appeal option ran out.""Kaur is heartbroken that she could not even bid a proper farewell to her home in the US. ""I couldn't go back even once to take care of my belongings, which were lying the way I left them,"" she told TOI.Now back in India, she said she was ""unwell"" and would stay with her sister in Mohali for the time being. ""Let's see what is in store for my life,"" she said.Kaur has all sympathy for those who were deported with her. ""They spent lakhs to go there. Some of them had spent 10 months to a year in detention and now return empty-handed. They were in distress as they had sold their land to reach US,"" said the elderly woman.Kaur's younger brother, Kulwant Singh, a farmer in Pangota village, told TOI that he and the entire family would take care of her.""We were able to get a travel document by ourselves and were trying to negotiate with ICE attorneys and US govt for her to depart on a commercial flight. That's all we were asking for,"" Ahluwalia said.""We had asked to release her for even 24 hours. You can put ankle monitoring, or do whatever you need to, but give her a chance to say her goodbyes and take care of what she needs to take care of, and she will depart from San Francisco on Monday. We had attached the flight ticket, but they stopped responding. And around 2am on Saturday, without notifying the attorney or anyone else, they took her from Mesa Verde and drove her to LA in handcuffs,"" he added.Ahluwalia said that a separate complaint would be given on the way Kaur was treated during her deportation. Kaur said whatever her counsel said in the video was true.Kulwant Singh, the younger brother, said that Harjit was second among four siblings. Their eldest brother Jasbir Singh passed away. ""It's sad the way she has been deported. She has been separated from her family. Now, I and our other family members will take care of her in Punjab, "" said Singh.","Harjit Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago after her husband, Sukhwinder Singh, passed away.

"What did Sam Presti say about the Los Angeles Clippers' controversy?

Sam Presti addresses L.A. Clippers allegations, tactfully avoids a direct comment

NBA investigates Clippers’ alleged salary cap circumvention involving Kawhi Leonard and Steve Ballmer

The NBA allegedly might punish the Los Angeles Clippers by requiring them to forfeit future draft picks as part of its ongoing investigation into the team's suspected salary cap violations. Amidst all this, the Oklahoma City Thunder’s general manager Sam Presti opened up about the whole situation. For context, the Oklahoma City Thunder acquired Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and several draft picks from the Los Angeles Clippers in July 2019 in exchange for Paul George, which is how Sam Presti became associated with the team.Recently, in light of the Clippers' cap circumvention allegations, Oklahoma City Thunder GM Presti opened up about the whole thing during a press conference. He said:“I'll leave this open-ended, but there's a guy who's been in a league a long time. He's seen a lot, anything you'd like to say on the allegations against the Clippers for the caps of the division. I, look, I thought I might get asked this, and I understand the question, but you know, I really don't feel comfortable talking about that. I just don't want to, I just don't want to comment on that…”He further said:“No one's ever given us a hand up in the standings. There are no built-in advantages, geographical climate, coastal economic bases, or in-state tax law start benefits. Whatever we want, we've had to make it happen. In this case, making it happen means having the discipline and the humility to turn the page and push ourselves forward…”Presti then added:“This approach fits us best, because in Oklahoma, we are builders. We're not guardians. We're not guarding or defending the past. That's over and it's ours. We are pursuing our future in whatever comes next. So we have the opportunity to be a really, really good team again.He finally concluded:“But it's not going to happen by imitating ourselves or trying to create a specific outcome. If we want to pursue excellence, we have to let go of last year and start again, turning every page, stacking every day with no guarantees, and of course, no silver platters. Just our state motto to remind us who we are, what we stand on, and what we're about…”Presti wasn't the only one who spoke about the entire dispute. The Athletic’s John Hollinger said that the Thunder would reportedly continue to receive the best selection compensation in 2027, while the Clippers would forfeit their pick swap, according to a veteran NBA executive.By giving Kawhi Leonard $28 million in the guise of a ""no-show"" endorsement deal with the now-bankrupt company, which was partially financed by Steve Ballmer, the L.A. Clippers have allegedly attempted to circumvent the NBA salary cap regulations.According to a source, the NBA has engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a law firm based in New York, to look into the claims. The claim suggested that Leonard, a star for the Los Angeles Clippers, signed an endorsement contract with a now-defunct environmental company in order to help his team and its billionaire owner, Steve Ballmer, get around the salary cap.Ballmer is further accused of orchestrating Leonard's purported no-show job in order to pay him more than the NBA salary cap would permit. According to the league, this would be extremely illegal if the allegations of salary-cap circumvention turn out to be accurate.Also read: $54m carbon cloud: Pablo Torre uncovers mysterious Los Angeles Clippers payments reportedly linked to Kawhi Leonard","Oklahoma City Thunder GM Sam Presti opened up about the L.A.

Poll Should the details of Sunjay Kapur's assets be made public or kept confidential? Made Public Kept Confidential

Here's what happened





NEW DELHI: Priya Sachdev Kapur has moved the Delhi high court seeking permission to file details of her late husband Sunjay Kapur’s assets in a sealed cover.The plea has been filed in the partition suit by Bollywood actor Karisma Kapoor and Sunjay Kapur’s two children, Samaira and Kiaan Raj, who are seeking a share in their father’s estate.The court had earlier directed Priya, Sunjay’s third wife, to provide a list of his assets.Justice Jyoti Singh made the observation while hearing an application moved by Sunjay Kapur's wife Priya Sachdev Kapur, seeking permission to file the list of his personal assets and liabilities in a sealed cover with the parties to be bound by confidentiality, or in the alternative, constitution of Confidentiality Club.Read also: Listing Sanjay Kapur's assets in sealed cover may be problematic: Delhi HC ""Allowing the application may be problematic for the simple reason that as the alleged beneficiary of the estate, they (Karisma's children Samaira Kapur and Kiaan Raj Kapur) have a right to question the assets disclosed. So, tomorrow if they have to verify and go about asking what has happened, if they are bound by this confidentiality club, how will they ever defend their case?"" the judge askedSenior Advocate Shyel Trehan, appearing for Priya, told the court that the asset details contained sensitive information and urged that only two pages be placed under confidentiality.“As far as I am concerned, this is a lot of information to be in public,” Trehan submitted, adding that while she was willing to share the documents with all parties, they should remain confidential.Meanwhile, the plaintiffs’ counsel contended that “banks have been wiped off, there is nothing left in the bank account,” and argued that information about properties could not be hidden.“In so far as property is concerned, the world should know at large that they don’t have to deal with those properties.It’s a proceeding in rem. Here they are producing a Will in written statement. Otherwise, it is a citation in public. How much will go in sealed cover? Then they say given NDA. How will I verify?”, the counsel said.The court will resume the hearing on the matter on Friday.In her plea, Priya has sought permission to submit a list of Sunjay Kapur’s movable and immovable assets in a sealed envelope, citing cybersecurity risks and potential misuse of sensitive financial details.She has further proposed that all parties — including Karisma Kapoor’s children and Sunjay’s mother, Rani Kapur — sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before accessing the documents. Alternatively, she suggested forming a “Confidentiality Club” restricting access to designated advocates and representatives.The application follows the court’s September 10 order, which directed Priya to file a comprehensive statement of Sunjay Kapur’s assets and liabilities as of June 12.At that hearing, Justice Jyoti Singh had also issued summons, set timelines for pleadings, and ordered that the purported Will of Sunjay Kapur — currently in Priya’s custody — be submitted in a sealed cover.The partition suit filed by Samaira and Kiaan Raj, through their mother Karisma Kapoor, seeks division of the multi-crore estate, rendition of accounts, and a permanent injunction against Priya and other family members. The next substantive hearing is scheduled for October 9, when the court will consider the plaintiffs’ plea to restrain the defendants from selling, alienating, or encumbering estate properties.During earlier hearings, Senior Advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, for the children, questioned the authenticity of the Will, alleging it was forged and produced under “suspicious circumstances,” including its sudden disclosure at the Taj Hotel and the executor learning of it just a day before. He stressed that the unregistered Will had never been revealed to the family despite repeated assurances from Sunjay Kapur about his children’s financial security.On the other hand, Senior Advocate Rajiv Nayar, for Priya, argued that the children were already beneficiaries of family trusts and had recently received Rs 1,900 crore. “It’s not as if these people are left on the streets. I am a widow with a six-year-old child. For 15 years, they were nowhere to be seen,” he said.Sunjay’s mother, Rani Kapur, represented by Senior Advocate Vaibhav Gaggar, also raised objections, claiming her rights under the family trust were undermined after Priya’s marriage. Expressing concern for her grandchildren, she told the court, “There’s something unholy going on. I am 80 years old and concerned for my grandchildren. Despite repeated mails, I never received a copy of the Will.”","Priya Sachdev Kapur has moved the Delhi high court seeking permission to file details of her late husband Sunjay Kapur’s assets in a sealed cover.

Mark Zuckerberg’s failed bid for TikTok





Shou Zi Chew, the Singapore-born CEO of TikTok, today leads one of the biggest competitors to Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta. But few know that at the start of his career, Chew actually worked for Zuckerberg. After earning an economics degree from University College London and later pursuing an MBA at Harvard Business School, Chew spent a summer internship at Facebook (now Meta), then an up-and-coming social media startup.After his brief stint in California, Chew moved through major financial and tech hubs including London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. In 2015, he joined Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi , playing a key role in the company’s public listing three years later as its chief financial officer. His work at Xiaomi positioned him as a rising executive in Asia’s fast-growing technology sector.Shou Zi Chew’s career took a sharp turn in 2021, when he joined ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Initially appointed as CFO, he was later named CEO of TikTok the same year, while briefly holding both roles. Under his leadership, TikTok surged past 1 billion users globally, including an estimated 150 million in the United States, making it one of the few major platforms outside Zuckerberg’s reach.TikTok’s rise has long frustrated Meta. According to reports, Mark Zuckerberg tried to acquire Musical.ly in 2016, a lip-syncing app that later merged into TikTok after ByteDance bought it for $800 million. Meta’s own rival app, Lasso, failed to gain traction and was shut down in 2020.As TikTok’s influence grew in the US, so did the scrutiny in Washington over the app’s Chinese ties. Chew has appeared before US lawmakers to defend the platform from allegations of being a national security risk due to its Chinese ownership. During a 2023 hearing, he drew contrasts with Facebook’s own track record, saying: “American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security. ”Zuckerberg has also voiced concerns about TikTok’s control by a foreign government but has also warned that banning the app could set a precedent for restricting online platforms.","Shou Zi Chew is the Singapore-born CEO of TikTok, one of the biggest competitors to Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta. Chew spent a summer internship at Facebook (now Meta), then an up-and-coming social media startup. He moved through major financial and tech hubs including London, Singapore, and Hong Kong.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124091259,imgsize-27376,width-400,resizemode-4/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew.jpg"
"Tech layoffs: Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle and Intel among companies that have cut jobs in 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-salesforce-oracle-and-intel-among-tech-giants-that-have-cut-jobs-in-2025/articleshow/124085478.cms,"Microsoft 's plan to layoff 9,000 employees



Intel may cut over 5,000 jobs



Salesforce staff headcount reduces to 5,000



Google lays off contract workers

Oracle is cutting jobs across US, India, Canada and Europe

Donald Trump announces H-1B visa fee hike







The tech industry continues to be impacted by a wave of layoffs in 2025, following a significant number of job cuts last year. According to the independent tracker Layoffs.fyi, more than 150,000 jobs were eliminated across 549 companies in 2024. This trend has carried into the new year, with over 22,000 workers already facing job reductions across the tech sector. According to a report by TechCrunch, 16,084 of these cuts occurred in February alone.As companies increasingly adopt AI and automation, this ongoing series of layoffs highlights the human impact of rapid technological change and the potential consequences for innovation across the industry. Here are some of the tech giants that have cut the maximum number of jobs this year.Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a plan to cut 9,000 employees, which represents under 4% of its global workforce. This is the latest in a series of reductions for the company this year, following cuts of less than 1% in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June.Chipmaker Intel is reportedly firing more than 5,500 employees across various US states, according to company filings.The tech giant had previously estimated a lower number of cuts, but has now stated the reduction is part of a plan to eliminate 24,000 to 25,000 jobs by the end of 2025. Intel stated the move is ""designed to create a faster-moving, flatter and more agile organization.""Salesforce has laid off another 4,000 employees from its customer support division, reducing its headcount in that department from 9,000 to 5,000. This reduction comes as the company focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), with AI agents now reportedly handling about one million customer conversations. The layoffs occurred despite the company reporting strong financial results.Google has also been affected by the layoff wave, with more than 200 contract workers laid off by GlobalLogic, a firm specialising in handling Google's AI rating projects. These contract workers reportedly believe they were used to train AI models that could eventually make their jobs redundant.US cloud service provider Oracle is continuing its large-scale job-cut drive across its global workforce. The latest round affected at least 254 employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a company filing. Reports also indicate that workers in India, Canada, and parts of Europe have been impacted, including 101 employees in Seattle.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order that significantly increases the fees for H-1B visas, a move that can shake up hirings in the tech industry. The fee for new H-1B visas has been hiked by to $100,000, a measure aimed at discouraging major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta from hiring foreign workers.For Indian IT professionals, who have long relied on H-1B sponsorships for US jobs, this new policy presents a dual crisis: fewer available positions and substantially higher barriers to entry. According to the new order, the increased fees and rules will not apply to current H-1B visa holders or those seeking to renew their visas; they will only impact future applicants.","Over 22,000 workers already facing job reductions across tech sector.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Divorce trends in Kuwait : Rising cases and new patterns





Marriage and divorce numbers: Contrasting realities in Kuwait





Ministry of Justice steps up family support and prevention efforts





Raising awareness and inter agency cooperation in Kuwait









Between January and July 2025, Kuwait witnessed a significant number of divorces among its citizens, with detailed statistics revealing new patterns in family dynamics. Despite these rising divorce figures, marriage rates remain robust. In response, the Ministry of Justice has implemented improved mediation strategies aimed at preserving family cohesion and addressing underlying social challenges.New data from Kuwait’s Ministry of Justice highlights 222 cases of khula (divorce initiated by wives) recorded between January 1 and July 31, 2025. Notably, 287 Kuwaiti women divorced before consummation of their marriages in the same period, outnumbering those who divorced after cohabitation. This suggests a shift in marital dissolution patterns, where many separations occur early on, even before couples fully start married life.Additionally, 439 cases involved Kuwaiti husbands divorcing one wife while remaining married to one or more other wives, reflecting complexities in polygamous family structures that still exist in the country.Despite the rising divorce figures, marriage rates among Kuwaitis remain strong.The Ministry of Justice reports a total of 5,993 marriages between Kuwaiti nationals in the first seven months of 2025. Over 75% of these marriages involved Kuwaiti citizens on both sides, underscoring the continued social importance of marriage in Kuwaiti society.However, divorces are not limited to recent marriages. The statistics reveal a total of 2,666 divorces during 2025 involving couples married in previous years. This indicates that many dissolutions happen after longer periods of marriage, pointing to challenges that affect families over time rather than only during the initial stages.In response to these developments, a responsible source at the Ministry of Justice confirmed the recent adoption of an enhanced framework aimed at reducing divorce rates. Central to this effort is the strengthening of marital reconciliation centers across Kuwait.These centers now operate with a multidisciplinary team comprising sociologists, family counselors, and religious scholars who actively engage with couples to mediate disputes before they escalate into divorce. Their role is to provide guidance, conflict resolution, and counseling tailored to the social and cultural context of Kuwaiti families.Beyond mediation, the Ministry emphasizes broad inter-agency collaboration to educate newly married couples about critical social risks. A key focus is raising awareness about the impact of drug abuse on families, a factor increasingly recognized for its potential to destabilize marriages and harm children.Officials also highlight the importance of informing couples about the social and psychological consequences of divorce, aiming to promote healthier family dynamics and reduce the strain on individuals and society.","Between January and July 2025, Kuwait recorded 2,666 divorces, including 222 khula and 287 pre-consummation cases.

"Goody bag of unnecessary pills: Indian-origin Dr Neil K Anand, who treated 9/11 patients, sentenced to 14 years in prison",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/goody-bag-of-unnecessary-pills-indian-origin-dr-neil-k-anand-who-treated-9/11-patients-sentenced-to-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/124133089.cms,"Dr Neil K Anand has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for medical fraud after years-long trial that he earlier called David vs Goliath legal battle with the US government.

Blank prescriptions pre-signed by Anand



Anand disputed allegations, said he treated victims of 9/11, was US Navy's physician







Indian-origin doctor Neil K Anand who was convicted for US health care fraud earlier this year has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for pushing his patients to accept goody bags of sedatives that they did not need so that he could get insurance money. The 48-year-old Pennsylvania doctor was also ordered to pay over $2 million in restitution and over $2 million in forfeiture.Layers of irregularities were uncovered in the investigation as apart from forcing patients to take medicines that they did not need, he pre-signed prescriptions where his interns, with no license to prescribe medicines, wrote controlled substances.According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Dr Anand conspired to submit false and fraudulent claims to health plans provided by Medicare, the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Independence Blue Cross (IBC), and Anthem, for “Goody Bags” of medically unnecessary prescription medications, which were dispensed to patients by in-house pharmacies owned by Anand. In total, Medicare, OPM, IBC, and Anthem paid over $2.4 million in reimbursements.To entice patients to take the unwanted Goody Bags, Anand also conspired to distribute oxycodone outside the usual course of medical practice and without a legitimate medical purpose. Unlicensed medical interns wrote prescriptions for controlled substances using blank prescriptions that were pre-signed by Anand. As part of the scheme, Anand prescribed 20,850 oxycodone tablets for nine different patients.After learning that he was under investigation, Anand concealed the proceeds of the fraud by transferring approximately $1.2 million into an account in the name of a relative and for the benefit of a minor relative.Dr Anand and his family disputed the allegations and said his compassion for patients was unfairly criminalized. He treated victims of 9/11 attacks in New York City in 2001 and then enlisted in the US Navy as a physician.“The law has spoken for now, but the deeper questions remain: What is healing? What is justice? Where’s the line between mercy and misconduct?” Anand said. US District Judge Chad F Kenney said he believed Anand had grown to be motivated by greed and illicit profits and not the needs of his patients. “For you, their pain was your gain,” Kenney said. “You were not focused during this period on treating your patients.”Dr Anand was charged in 2019 and as his trial went for years, several groups on social media claimed that he became a victim of government propaganda and sought support. ""The government is using artificial intelligence and manipulated data to prosecute me for treating chronic pain patients, turning tools meant to help into weapons against doctors,"" Dr Anand wrote earlier in a blog seeking support.",Indian-origin doctor Neil K Anand was convicted for US health care fraud earlier this year.
