The woman claimed that she decided to quit her job as she felt homesick after being ""engulfed by negativity"". Apart from her daily tussle with auto drivers, she recounted one particular incident when she called BESCOM office to complain about a power cut.She was asked to speak in Kannada, no Hindi and English, the woman claimed.""I was working in Bangalore for 1.5 years. Married in Punjab, I wore chooda for the entire 1 year as it is a part of my tradition. It was clearly evident I was from North India,"" Shaani Nani posted.""What a harassment it was to commute in auto from flat to office and back. The audacity of local auto drivers to strike a conversation on why I was in Bangalore when I belonged to North, if I was learning Kannada, asking if I like anything apart from weather, asking for more money as I was newly married and pretending not to understand a word when I would talk in Hin/Eng,"" she added.""Once I called BESCOM to complain about power cut, the guy ended the call saying 'No hindi, no English, only Kannada'.

""It was your choice. Yes, jingoism towards non kannada tends to be high there, no harm in trying to adjust and learn a bit of local language. What the auto drivers do is wrong, absolutely.

Karnataka Reservation Bill: Karnataka government puts job reservation bill on hold amid massive backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-holds-job-reservation-bill-amid-massive-backlash/articleshow/111814898.cms,"Karnataka job quota

: What is the contentious bill?

Andhra Pradesh versus Karnataka over quota

The Karnakata government has decided to put the controversial job reservation bill on hold for the time being facing massive pushback from industries. Chief minister Siddaramaiah said the bill will be revisited and the future course of action will be decided in the coming days. ""The bill approved by the cabinet to provide reservation for Kannadigas in private sector organizations, industries and enterprises has been temporarily put on hold,"" the chief minister issued a statement on X.The Karnataka State Employment of Local Candidates in the Industries, Factories and Other Establishments Bill, 2024 was passed in the Cabinet meeting on Monday.It said any industry, factory or other establishments shall appoint 50 per cent of local candidates in management categories and 70 per cent in non-management categories.If the candidates do not have secondary school certificates with Kannada as a language, they would have to pass a Kannada proficiency test, the bill stipulated.The Kannada-must provision drew flak from industry leaders as they argued that Bengaluru will lose skilled talent if such a bill is adopted. Another genius move from Govt of Karnataka. ""Mandate LOCAL RESERVATION & APPOINT GOVT OFFICER IN EVERY COMPANY to monitor. This will scare Indian IT & GCCs. Short sighted,"" Assocham co-chairman RK Mishra said.Karnataka's move is similar to a bill introduced by the Haryana government, mandating 75 per cent reservation in private sector jobs to residents of the state. It was, however, struck down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on November 17, 2023.A bill enforcing 50 per cent reservation for administrative posts and 75 per cent for non-administrative posts for Kannadigas in private industries is the bone of contention.Initially, the government was defensive about the move of prioritizing the Kannadigas as Siddaramaiah said the government does not want the Kannadigas to be deprived of job opportunities in the state. ""We are a pro-Kannada government. Our priority is to look after the welfare of the Kannadigas,"" Siddaramaiah said.With the industries expressing concerns that they may have to shut shops in Karnataka if Kannada becomes a qualifier for jobs, Andhra Pradesh minister Nara Lokesh did not miss the opportunity to try to lure away the industry honchos.""We understand your disappointment. We welcome you to expand or relocate your businesses to our IT, IT services, AI and data center cluster at Vizag. We will offer you best-in-class facilities, uninterrupted power, infrastructure and the most suitable skilled talent for your IT enterprise with no restrictions from the Government. Andhra Pradesh is ready to welcome you. Please get in touch!"" Nara Lokesh posted.Karnataka minister Priyanka Kharge replied to Lokesh and asked whether the minister does not want Andhra Pradesh companies to employ Andhra people.""Karnataka has always excelled in the most sector due to our consistent relationships and consultative approach with industry leaders, advisory bodies, and consortiums in drafting policies and schemes. As with previous initiatives, this draft bill will include recommendations from our industry partners,"" Kharge wrote.""Our goal is to develop a global workforce using local talent, while also encouraging global investments and creating employment opportunities.""""By the way, wouldn’t you also like to ensure that every company invested in Andhra Pradesh employs deserving, trained and skilled individuals from Andhra Pradesh? Dear @nasscom, be rest assured, we will not do anything that will not withstand legal scrutiny.

Strategy switch: Agencies now must share narco info,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strategy-switch-agencies-now-must-share-narco-info/articleshow/111845111.cms,"NEW DELHI: As part of its crackdown on narco-smuggling , govt on Thursday announced a switch to a ""duty-to-share"" protocol to make agencies exchange crucial information on drug trafficking .Union home minister Amit Shah emphasised that profits generated from narco-smuggling mark the ""most serious security threat"" as he called for a rigorous review of financial investigations into drug cartels at the state level and advocated establishment of joint coordination committees in states to ensure the involvement of central agencies and finance ministry.The agencies involved in the anti-drug trafficking effort have so far worked on ""need-to-know"" principle: a scheme where one agency could use its discrimination to determine what and how much to share with others and which carried the risk of important information remaining siloed, allowing the nimble footed and shrewd traffickers room to peddle the contraband.Addressing the meeting of Narco-Coordination Centre (NCORD) in Delhi, Shah said, ""Our agencies have traditionally adhered to a need-to-know policy. However, it is imperative that we now transition to a duty-to-share approach. We must ensure that anti-drug initiatives permeate every unit at the state and district levels, thereby accelerating their implementation."" He called upon central agencies to initiate suo moto cases to dismantle international narco-cartels. ""We must also ensure that not a single gram of drugs enters Bharat or is transported to other countries via Bharat,"" he asserted, emphasising that profits from trafficking are used to fund terrorism against the country.","Home minister Amit Shah emphasised that profits generated from narco-smuggling mark the ""most serious security threat"" He called for a rigorous review of financial investigations into drug cartels at the state level.

Lack of intelligence contributing to casualties in J&K anti-terror ops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lack-of-intelligence-contributing-to-casualties-in-jk-anti-terror-ops/articleshow/111845106.cms,"NEW DELHI: The lack of good “human intelligence” and “signal intelligence” continues to lead to higher casualties among the security forces in counter-terror operations in the Jammu region , where terrorists well versed in military-style ambushes are taking advantage of low troop density due to the relocation of forces to the China front.After a review of the terror surge in the south of the Pir Panjal range by a flurry of meetings, which included a PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security on Thursday, officials said “additional Army and central police forces as well as technology” are now being deployed in the Jammu region but it would take some time for the situation to stabilize.“It is a huge area, with a tough mountain and jungle terrain along with caves and other hideouts. There are around 35-40 battle-hardened terrorists active in the Jammu region, who are operating in small teams. Intelligence inputs say most of them are of Pakistan-origin and belong to the Jaish-e-Mohammed,” a senior officer said.The motivated terrorists, armed with modern weapons, ammunition and encrypted communication equipment including Chinese-origin “ultra-sets”, have caused a series of setbacks to the Army in the Jammu region in six to seven attacks this year alone.The latest attack being the one in Doda on Monday in which four soldiers, including a captain, were killed. In some cases, the terrorists have even released videos of the bodies of soldiers being mutilated after the ambushes.Overall, the security forces including the Army have lost around 125 personnel in J&K since 2021, with at least 52 of them being killed in the Jammu region. “Pakistan has clearly shifted the focus of terrorism from the Kashmir Valley to the Jammu region. Earlier, terrorist activities were largely restricted to the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch but have now spread to other places like Reasi, Doda, Bhaderwah, Kathua and Udhampur as well,” another officer said.The Army’s shifting of specialized counter-insurgency troops, including the “Uniform Force” of the Rashtriya Rifles, from the region to eastern Ladakh after China’s multiple intrusions into eastern Ladakh in May 2020 has led to a major operational and intelligence gap there.“The humint ( human intelligence ) from the locals and others has virtually dried up. It takes time and sustained effort to build a humint network, which is critical for counter-insurgency operations,” the officer said.Moreover, many terrorists have also begun to use specialized ultra-sets and other highly encrypted telecom equipment, which are tough to intercept, since last year. “So, the absence of credible humint is compounded by the relative lack of sigint ( signal intelligence ) as well,” he said.“Local politics has also alienated a section of the Gujjars and Bakarwals, who act as eyes and ears of the security forces. Pakistan is exploiting all this, having kept the terror training infrastructure on its territory and PoK intact,” he added.It also seems that the security forces have largely failed to draw tactical lessons from the ambushes laid by terrorists in the Jammu region, which has easier infiltration routes from across the border as compared to the Kashmir region.","Terrorists well versed in military-style ambushes are taking advantage of low troop density due to the relocation of forces to the China front.

The inner chamber had three wooden almirahs, one steel almirah, two wooden chests, and one iron chest. Those were opened and the ornaments were transferred in the same order they were into the strongroom,” said Biswanath Rath , chairman of a 16-member committee set up by the govt to oversee the repair and inventory of the Ratna Bhandar.According to temple administration’s chief administrator Arabinda Padhee, the committee members neither inspected nor viewed the articles, which were stored inside small boxes in the chests and almirahs.“We shifted the valuables as such to the new storewells and didn’t check up nor see the items,” Padhee said, reiterating that the inventory of the articles will be conducted only after the completion of the repair and restoration by ASI.The temple administration said ASI would soon start the renovation of the outer and inner chambers. The Ratna Bhandar supervisory committee will move the govt, seeking permission for the ASI to carry out laser scanning of the walls and ceilings of the two chambers.The committee members refuted claims of any tunnels or secret chambers inside the Rath Bhandar, dismissing such discussions as unfounded and gossip.","Valuables stored in the inner chamber of Ratna Bhandar of Puri Jagannath temple were on Thursday shifted to a temporary strongroom set up inside the shrine.

Monetisation of assets will take place to pay off the liabilities. In the interim of monetisation of assets and some bonds getting due, the sovereign guarantee bonds stand good. Government of India stands behind those bonds and there will be no default.”Speaking on the sidelines of the India Mobile Congress curtain-raiser event here, Scindia said despite delays, people should have “national pride” and patience in waiting for the upgradation as it is being done on indigenous technologies and not something which is sourced from foreign vendors.“Develop a sense of national pride… The easy for us would have been to pick up technologies (from global vendors), and do what others do. But we feel that India must not be just a supplier of services, but also of products. So, we chose the harder way, and decided to develop the India 4G stack ourselves.”A consortium of Tata-run Tejas and TCS and public sector C-DOT has been working on the complex technologies to develop 4G and 5G telecom infrastructure that will be deployed on BSNL and MTNL networks. “Let me guarantee. We are on track to deploy one lakh RANs (radio access networks) towards this effort.”Scindia said efforts of the govt have been to develop technologies within India which will be used not only for domestic use, but also for exports. “From hardly anything a decade back, export of telecom equipment last year was to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.”The minister also said that the govt wants to be a facilitator in enabling the growth of the sector, against acting as a regulator. He said after leapfrogging and witnessing rapid growth in 5G, India is now working to be a leader in the development of 6G technologies. “A country that followed the world in 4G, walked with it in 5G, will now lead when it comes to 6G.”Scindia said that India is now working on encouraging the development of apps and solutions for 5G that would be deployed in rural areas.On cybersecurity, the minister said that as India develops on the digital front, there is a looming threat on the front of cyber security. “Wars today are not only fought on land, but also on the cloud. It is important to protect the country, the citizens, and businesses when it comes to cybersecurity.”","Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said turnaround efforts of state- run telcos are being monitored on a daily basis.

Violence-affected families of Tripura voices appeasing politics of government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/violence-affected-families-of-tripura-voices-appeasing-politics-of-government/articleshow/111842868.cms,"AGARTALA: Amid severe discontent among the victim families of ethnic conflict last week in Tripura’s Gandatwisa sub-division for non-action against the accused persons of arson, the administration has been pushing pictures to portray normalcy, which triggered reactions.The homeless families raised their voices against the administration on Thursday alleging it played a partial role.The government has announced a compensation package of Rs 93,000 for each of the 165 victim families who lost homes and hearths, shops, and valuables, and now have taken shelter in Gandatwisa HS School as refugees.Sushanta Debnath, a small businessman in a local market who lost almost everything in the arson and looting spree alleged, that the college student Parameshwar Reang (21) was beaten up in a distant village from the town for a different reason in the presence of security personnel; he was electrocuted while running away from the spot and unfortunately, he died in the hospital.Police arrested four of the accused persons involved in the crime. But with that reference, displaced Brus of Mizoram who were given settlements in nearby areas carried out targeted selective attacks on the shops and houses of surrounding localities on July 12 at midnight. They initially looted the shops and set them on fire and later when the people out of fear, they looted the houses and set them ablaze.The miscreants had blockaded the roads of police and fire service before launching arson and police were prevented by a group of Brus. Most surprisingly, police were also watching the fire flame from a distance not resorting to any action against the people who stopped their roads and arson the houses and shops, Debnath alleged and added, “Even after a week of the incident, none of them were arrested, instead now threatening us of legal action since we protested.”He further stated, “We 165 families residing in the area since time immemorial with the local tribal families. Even when the insurgency was at a peak, we did not face any problems rather got protection from the local tribals but as soon as Bru settlements came up, everyday people were facing trouble like theft incidents, ethnic clashes, and crimes.”“We have built up properties with our hard-earned money over decades, but for no reason within an hour, everything was reduced to ashes. The scale of loss varies from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 50 lakh but the government is offering us less than a lakh of rupees as compensation. All our dreams end in the relief camp now where we are getting minimum ration, no substantial amenities, water supply, and electricity. Moreover, the government is appeasing the criminals,” Debnath mentioned.This government is playing the politics of blatant appeasement to create illusory goodwill for votes. The entire violence and chain of events on the incompetence and partisanship of police and administration, alleged another victim Chandan Chakraborty.“Nobody tries to verify the fact that Parameshwar Reang had tried to save the life of a mentally retarded boy, his neighbor, from the clutches of four other drunken youths; when Parameshwar himself was threatened he fled but unfortunately he stumbled and fell on a generator and got electrocuted; we arranged to send Parameshwar to hospital, bearing expenses but the news was spread reversed,” said Chakraborty.“Ignoring our issues, police and district administration have been posting some crafted photographs of the market to show the normalcy but the reality is different. The boy who couldn’t sleep without a fan and the day didn’t start with a good breakfast, is spending nights on a bare floor and mosquito bites. None of these photographs didn’t get the attention of the administration,” pointed out another victim Dilip Saha.Meanwhile, Director General of Tripura Police Amitabh Ranjan said, a specific case has been lodged against certain ‘vested’ interest individuals involved in the protest in Gandatwisa. Efforts are underway to arrest them and to a large extent, normalcy has been restored.","The government has announced a compensation package of Rs 93,000 for each of the 165 victim families who lost homes and hearths, shops, and valuables.

‘Should have alerted us’

BENGALURU: A 28-year-old youth, who was allegedly humiliated and threatened after the scooter he was riding in under the influence of alchohol brushed against a car near Doddanekkundi on June 30, ended his life a day later in east Bengaluru.The deceased is Srishail M Dhanak , a resident of Kundalahalli and office assistant in a private firm near Doddanekkundi.His scooter was taken away by the car owner after threatening him that he would not return it until he paid for the damage to the car. Srishail’s family was clueless why he took the extreme step on July 1.The family, on July 12, received a phone call from Mahadevapura traffic police, who asked them to bring Srishail to the station as a software engineer, Shreyas MP , wanted to lodge a complaint against him in connection with an accident .On visiting the station, Srishail’s brother and father learnt about the humiliation he had to face with regard to the accident and suspected that the trauma had pushed him to take the extreme step. Srishail’s father filed a complaint against Shreyas and others on July 13. HAL police have registered a case under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita-2023, Section 108 (abetment to suicide ).Srishail lived with his parents in a rented house. His parents had gone to their hometown of Kalaburagi to attend a function late last month. Srishail didn’t report to work on July 1 and his phone remained switched off. His office reached out to one of his family members. His brother-in-law went to Srishail’s house only to find him hanging.According to police, Srishail met a colleague in Chinnappanahalli on June 30 and he was returning home after partying when the accident occurred. The family maintained that Srishail didn’t have any issues to end his life. The family took the body to their hometown after postmortem and completed the final rites. Since the family was in shock, they didn’t give a thought about his scooter he had purchased only six months earlier. Srishail’s elder brother Ashok MD said: “On July 12, we found Srishail’s electric scooter at the station. Shreyas had taken his scooter after the incident.”Shreyas had recorded a 30-second video in which he was seen shouting at Shrishail alleging that he was drunk, but he didn’t record the whole incident, Ashok said.“Shreyas wanted to settle things at the traffic police station, but we didn’t agree as he was at fault for taking our scooter and keeping it with him for 12 days. My father and I went to the accident spot and spoke to a few people, including the security guard of a nearby apartment. They informed us that Shreyas and Srishail were at the spot for almost 30 minutes. They told us that Shreyas was demanding money and threatening him. We realised my brother ended his life because of the incident. It was the first scooter my brother had bought with his earnings,” he added.A police officer said: “Shreyas made a mistake by taking the scooter and keeping it with him. He should have lodged a complaint by noting down the registration number or alerted us from the spot. He tried reaching Srishail on his mobile number on July 1. As his phone was switched off, he traced his office with the help of a parking sticker on the scooter. He came to the station to lodge a complaint on July 8. We asked him to bring Srishail’s scooter immediately. But he turned up only on July 12.”If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in need of emotional support, call suicide-prevention helplines — Arogya Vani: 104, Sahay Helpline: 080-25497777","Srishail M Dhanak was allegedly humiliated and threatened after the scooter he was riding in under the influence of alchohol brushed against a car near Doddanekkundi on June 30.

Delhi-Mumbai Expressway: Delhi-Mumbai Expressway Delayed Again: Full Completion Expected by October 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-mumbai-expressway-completion-delayed-to-2025/articleshow/111793066.cms,"NEW DELHI: You have to wait for more than a year to drive non-stop from Delhi to Mumbai. Govt’s flagship Delhi-Mumbai expressway is likely to be fully operational by the end of next year. The project has been delayed in Gujarat due to land-related issues , sources said. The work for two ‘packages’ of 62 km in Gujarat was bid out only in Nov 2023. While work could start in April this year on one of the packages, construction on the other stretch began this month.Though govt had set the initial deadline to complete the entire project by Jan 2023, there have been several extensions and the last revised target had been set for March 2024, which too now has been breached.Sources said it takes at least one and a half years to build any stretch. The corridor was divided into small ‘packages’ for faster execution. Officials said all the remaining issues relating to the land availability are being sorted out.So far, around 630 km out of the total 1,386 km has been opened for traffic and that too in different stretches. For example, the Sohna-Dausa-Sawai Madhopur (293 km) has been opened to traffic; another stretch between Jhalawar-MP/Gujarat border (245 km) has been operational. Officials said that they are confident that the first section of the country’s longest expressway from Sohna to Vadodara (845 km) is set to be fully opened for traffic by March 2025. Subsequently, other sections, including the three links to JNPT in Mumbai, Jewar Airport in Uttar Pradesh and DND Flyway in Delhi would be opened to traffic.“Non-availability of land is the biggest hurdle in the execution of road projects. The state govts concerned need to take proactive steps to ensure land acquisition is completed and required patches are handed over. It’s far more important when we are building greenfield or new alignment highways and expressways,” said a former NHAI official.In fact, last year, the road transport and highways ministry, in a written reply submitted in Rajya Sabha, had said that the NHAI had awarded the work for construction of a 35-km stretch of the expressway corridor in Valsad district in Gujarat costing Rs 3,633 crore and another 27 km stretch in Navsari district for Rs 2,287 crore. In both cases, the construction had not started.The expressway passes through seven states. TOI has learnt that while almost entire stretches falling in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have been completed, the progress is abysmally slow in Gujarat. Officials said, now since work has started in all packages, they are confident of the entire expressway becoming operational by Oct next year.",The project has been delayed in Gujarat due to land-related issues.

NEW DELHI: The upcoming Union Budget 2024-25 , scheduled for presentation on July 23rd, holds immense significance for the future of school education in India. Experts and stakeholders have high expectations for the government to unveil transformative reforms that address longstanding challenges and propel the system towards greater equity, quality, and future-readiness.Stakeholders in the education sector are voicing their expectations for substantial reforms and increased investments in school education.From addressing infrastructure needs to enhancing digital learning capabilities, the budget holds the promise of shaping a more inclusive and robust education system.Experts and educators are hopeful that the government will prioritize education spending and implement policies that foster innovation, accessibility, and quality in schools. The following key demands and expectations outline the sector's hopes for transformative measures that can propel India's education system forward.A central expectation is a significant increase in budgetary allocation for the Department of School Education and Literacy. This will be crucial for strengthening the foundation of the system. Experts anticipate a renewed focus on key schemes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS), ensuring better infrastructure, learning materials, and nutritional support for students across the country.Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of PW and Chair of the India EdTech Consortium (IEC), emphasizes the need for GST exemption on educational expenses for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. He argues that students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low Income Group (LIG) families should receive 100% GST exemption on all educational expenses, including test-prep courses and job-oriented skill courses. ""The current 18% GST rate is prohibitive for families with limited resources, hindering access to quality education,"" Maheshwari stated. He calls for a government mechanism to make education more affordable and clear exemptions, particularly concerning student housing.Increased budget allocation for education is a significant expectation. Maheshwari has always maintained that ""the Union budget should serve as a catalyst for education, aiming towards a more optimal allocation of at least 6% of GDP."" Current spending on education has hovered between 2.5% to 3%, which falls short of meeting the sector's growing needs. A higher allocation would support the establishment of new K-12 schools, enhance educational infrastructure, and improve overall educational outcomes across the country. This is crucial for fostering innovation and expanding educational opportunities in underserved communities.Aarul Malaviya, Founder of Zamit, underscores the significance of digital infrastructure in modern education. He asserts that the upcoming budget presents a critical opportunity to bolster digital learning capabilities in schools. Malaviya explains, ""It is imperative to allocate funds for improving internet connectivity, providing modern devices, and equipping teachers and students with essential digital skills."" Enhancing these aspects will enable interactive and personalized learning experiences, leveraging technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Such investments are pivotal for preparing students to thrive in a digital-first world and ensuring equitable access to quality education.Kanak Gupta, Group Director of Seth M. R. Jaipuria Schools, stresses the importance of investing in teacher training and professional development. Comprehensive teacher training programs and continuous professional development are essential for enhancing teaching quality and adapting to evolving educational methodologies. Gupta says, ""The budget should prioritize substantial investments in upgrading digital literacy among educators and fostering innovative teaching practices."" This initiative will empower teachers to effectively integrate technology into classrooms and cater to diverse learning needs, ultimately enhancing educational outcomes nationwide.Shridhar Venkat, CEO of The Akshaya Patra Foundation, highlights the need for inclusive education policies and support for children with special needs. He praises the interim budget's focus on nutrition and education initiatives, including the Sampoornata Abhiyaan and PM POSHAN, and hopes these will be reinforced in the final 2024-25 Budget. Venkat elaborates, ""There is a critical need to expand programs that integrate children with disabilities into mainstream education, providing them with necessary nutrition and educational support to thrive."" The budget should maintain or enhance allocations to ensure comprehensive support for children with special needs, bringing out-of-school children to mainstream education and ensuring no child is left behind due to hunger.Praveen Singh, CEO of AASOKA by MBD Group, advocates for lowering GST rates on educational products and services to enhance affordability. Singh argues, ""Reducing the GST slab from 18% to 5% on educational products and services is crucial for making quality education more accessible to all segments of society."" This reduction will alleviate financial burdens on students and parents, encouraging greater participation in educational programs and enhancing the adoption of modern learning resources.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

US announces $203 million in new aid to war-torn Sudan amid major humanitarian crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-announces-203-million-in-new-aid-to-war-torn-sudan-amid-major-humanitarian-crisis/articleshow/111849558.cms,"UNITED NATIONS: The US ambassador to the United Nations announced nearly $203 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Sudan on Thursday but warned that the money is not a ""panacea"" and urged other countries to fulfill their financial pledges to address what she called ""the world's worst humanitarian crisis.""World leaders pledged more than $2.1 billion in humanitarian aid for Sudan at a donors conference in Paris in April, but US envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield said only about a quarter of the promised funds have been received three months later.The northeastern African country descended into chaos in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the country's military and a notorious paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces , exploded into open fighting in the capital of Khartoum.The devastating conflict has spread, especially to western Darfur, and has killed more than 14,000 people and wounded 33,000 others, according to the United Nations. It has also created the world's largest displacement crisis, with more than 11 million people forced to flee their homes.Thomas-Greenfield said Thursday's contribution raises total US humanitarian assistance to Sudan to $1.6 billion since September 2023, making the United States Sudan's largest single donor.""We hope this new round of aid serves as a call to action for others to follow,"" she said.The ambassador said the additional $203 million will go toward food supplies, shelters, schools and health services, as well as cash assistance to refugees to help pay their rents. The funds also will help neighboring countries, where over 2 million Sudanese refugees have fled, she said.The US mission to the UN said Thomas-Greenfield briefed UN diplomats on the hunger crisis in Sudan, where a record 25 million people face acute food insecurity and 755,000 people face famine in the coming months, according toa recent report by the UN global network monitoring the threat of famine.Human rights experts working for the United Nations said both sides have used food and starvation as a weapon of war.Thomas-Greenfield recalled her visit to a hospital in Chad run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders: ""Children were so weak they lacked the energy to even cry.""Global humanitarian aid organization Mercy Corps recently estimated that nine in 10 children suffer from life-threatening malnutrition in central Darfur, where the World Food Program has delivered aid in recent months after facing challenges negotiating access with armed groups.Thomas-Greenfield said the US will continue diplomatic efforts to hold perpetrators of the violence accountable and reach a peace agreement between the warring parties.Last week, representatives of the two sides arrived in Geneva for separate talks with the UN secretary-general's personal envoy, Ramtane Lamamra, about protecting civilians through possible local cease-fires.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said late Thursday that Lamamra and his team have continued engaging separately with each of the delegations throughout this week on humanitarian assistance and protection of civilians. He said the talks are expected to conclude Friday.They marked the second attempt at deescalation after talks in Saudi Arabia's port city of Jeddah broke down at the end of last year.",The US ambassador to the United Nations announced nearly $203 million in additional humanitarian assistance.
