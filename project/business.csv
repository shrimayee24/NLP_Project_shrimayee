Sign of four: GRAP to squeeze Delhi further

Also read:

NEW DELHI: The toxic haze hanging over NCR for past few days intensified on Sunday and Delhi’s average Air Quality Index deteriorated to the season’s worst of 441 at 4pm, well into the ‘severe’ zone, compared to 419 a day earlier. By 6pm, it had surpassed 450, reaching the ‘severe plus’ category, prompting Commission for Air Quality Management to impose the fourth and most extreme stage of Graded Response Action Plan in NCR from 8am on Monday.CM Atishi posted: “Physical classes shall be discontinued for all students, apart from Class 10 & 12. All schools will hold online classes till further orders.” Grap-4 also gives an option to central and NCR govts to shift to work-from-home for employees.GRAP-IV is clamped when the poison in the air reaches ""emergency' levels with AQI surpassing 450 (on a scale of 500). It primarily focuses on vehicular restrictions to reduce pollution. Under stage 4, entry of non-emergency trucks into Delhi has been barred for non-BS 6 compliant light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered outside Delhi, and BS-4 and below diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles in Delhi. The exemption earlier granted to construction and demolition (C&D) activities in linear public projects such as highways, roads, flyovers, over bridges, power transmission, and pipelines has now been removed.Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that the AQI rapidly surged through the day, as visibility remained poor. Delhi's AQI was 421 at 9am, which spiked to 452 at 6pm and further increased to 468 at 10pm. This was the fourth 'severe' day of the month. Before this, the AQI briefly remained in the 'severe plus' band on Nov 13 when it went up to 454 at 9pm. However, as CPCB considers the day's AQI at 4pm, Delhi on Sunday recorded an AQI of 441, the second highest this year after 447 on January 14.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, ""This is happening because of the combined impact of the deepening of winter inversion and trapping of high local and regional pollution. We need urgent measures to slow down further loading of pollution from the key sources.""The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 stood at 25.2% on Saturday, according to the Decision Support System.No respite from toxic air is expected in the next few days. ""The average AQI for Delhi is expected to remain in the adverse range owing to heavy fog, variable winds, highly unfavourable meteorological and climatic conditions. Forecasts from IMD/llTM indicate a likelihood of the AQI of Delhi to particularly remain in the higher end of the 'severe'/ 'severe+' category in the coming days,"" said CAQM.The measures under GRAP-IV are in addition to the preventive/restrictive actions mentioned under Stage 1 to 3, already in force. Though the ban on construction and demolition activity came into force on Nov 15 under stage 3 of GRAP, linear public projects were included in the exemption. However, the commission on Sunday banned C&D activity in linear public projects.CAQM said govts in Delhi and NCR to take a decision on allowing public, municipal, and private offices to work at 50% strength and the rest to work from home. Centre govt may take an appropriate decision on permitting work from home for employees in central govt offices. ""State govts may consider additional emergency measures like the closure of colleges/educational institutions and closure of non-emergency commercial activities, permitting the running of vehicles on an odd-even basis of registration numbers etc,"" said commission in its order.The Met department said mainly smog conditions with wind speed less than 6kmph from the northwest direction prevailed over the region in the forenoon on Sunday. Winds below 6kmph are unable to disperse pollutants.The lowest visibility on Sunday was 500 metres at Palam between 8.30am and 9am, while it dipped to 300m at 7am at Safdarjung, which is the city's base station, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). Even during the day, with sunlight staying faint, visibility remained low throughout the entire day. A maximum visibility of 900m was recorded at Palam at 5.30 pm and 800 metres at Safdarjung at 2.30 pm.By 11pm at night, visibility at Palam had dropped precipitously to 150m.Even the maximum temperature dipped to 27.2 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. It was the season's lowest maximum temperature. The minimum temperature stood at 15.9 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.IMD has issued an 'orange' alert for very dense to dense fog on Sunday night or Monday morning.","The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 stood at 25.2% on Saturday, according to the Decision Support System.

80-year-old who lives alone in a Uttarakhand ghost village is an unlikely film heroine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/80-year-old-who-lives-alone-in-a-uttarakhand-ghost-village-is-an-unlikely-film-heroine/articleshow/115395647.cms,"Film set 6km away, Devi worried about leaving buffalo alone

PITHORAGARH: Hira Devi, 80, is an unlikely film heroine from one of Uttarakhand's ghost villages, Gadtir, which has several empty houses because of migration. The octogenarian, who is illiterate and has lived in the mountain village most of her life, recently got a chance to star in 'Pyre', a film inspired by a story similar to her own, which will have its world premiere on Tuesday (Nov 19) at the 28th Tallinn Black Nights International Film Festival in Estonia.When she was invited to attend the festival, Devi had one concern - leaving behind her constant companion, her buffalo, since the-re is no one in the village to care for it.Produced by filmmaker Vinod Kapri, 'Pyre' tells a poignant love story of an elderly couple in their 80s. It is the only Indian entry selected in the 'Official Competition' category at the prestigious festival held annually in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.The film (Pyre) is based on a true tale from a village in Munsyari. Filmmaker Vinod Kapri wrote the screenplay and dialogues in 2018 after getting to know the story from a friend. Sudhir Rathor, a member of the production team, said they wanted to cast local villagers for the lead roles and were looking around the area to see who could fit the bill.Padam Singh, a former Army man from Munsyari and a regular performer in local Ramlilas, was cast as the male lead. While scouting around for the female lead, Kapri met a few local women carrying fodder from the forest who recommended Hira Devi for her cheerful and expressive nature and ability to sing.Initially, Devi was hesitant to take up the role as the filming location was 6km away from her home, and she didn't want to leave her buffalo alone for too long.A widow, she lives alone in the village and says that her buffalo serves as her primary companion. Her daughter is married and resides in Barani, while her two sons work in Delhi. She eventually agreed after her elder son, who was acquainted with Kapri, convinced her to go ahead.When the film was selected for Tallinn festival and she was asked if she could attend the premiere, Devi once again hesitated, with her primary concern being the buffalo again. However, with persuasion from the filmmakers, she asked her daughter to care for it in her absence.On Sunday, after her daughter arrived in the village, Devi, along with Kapri and Padam Singh, left for Tallinn to represent the film on the global stage, happy that the animal will be well cared for in her absence.","Hira Devi, 80, is an unlikely film heroine from Uttarakhand's ghost villages, Gadtir.

The bill proposes that holders of certain offices of profit will be exempted from being disqualified from becoming, or being, members of Parliament (MPs).The bill has incorporated certain recommendations made by joint committee on offices of profit (JCOP), then headed by Kalraj Mishra in the 16th Lok Sabha. The committee has suggested that MPs nominated in various flagship schemes and programmes, such as Swachh Bharat Mission , Smart City Mission and Deen Dayal Upadhyay-Grameen Kaushalya Yojana, should be saved from incurring disqualification.The ministry said the 1959 Act was enacted to declare that certain offices of profit under govt shall not disqualify the holders thereof for being chosen as, or for being, an MP. The JCOP undertook a comprehensive review of the Act and submitted recommendations, which included comprehensive definition of 'offices of profit'; insertion of provision to resolve the conflict between the Act and certain other statutes; omit the obsolete entries in the schedule; and amend the Act in a time-bound manner.""Keeping in view of the aforesaid recommendations of the JCOP, it is felt by the legislative department to repeal and re-enact the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959. Accordingly, ""A draft bill has been prepared on lines of the recommendations made by the JCOP,"" the law ministry said. Besides rationalising section 3 of the existing Act, doing away with negative list of offices provided in the schedule, the draft bill proposes to remove conflict between the existing Act and certain other statutes, which have a provision for not to incur disqualification.The draft bill also proposes to omit section 4 of the existing law relating to ""temporary suspension"" of disqualification in certain cases, and in its place, empower the central govt to amend the schedule by issuing a notification.","Law ministry has invited comments on draft legislation Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Bill, 2024.

This is pinching margins of companies such as Delhi-NCR's IGL, Mumbai's MGL and Adani Total Gas , which operates in Gujarat and other markets, as they are making up the shortfall with costlier gas from new fields or imported LNG (liquefied natural gas).Technically, govt doesn't control CNG or PNG prices. But, an upward revision in CNG prices, which impacts auto, taxi, bus and transport operators, at this point is politically untenable for Centre in view of assembly polls in Maharashtra and Delhi that are served by MGL and IGL, which are promoted by govt-run oil firm.People in the know told TOI a senior ministry official checkmated operators at a recent interaction by asking the executives to prove claims of loss by sharing their cost break-up, which they declined. This prompted the official to hit back, saying, ""How is it IGL posts a net profit of Rs 1,748 crore on a revenue of close to Rs 16,000 crore in 2023-24. That is a margin of 11%. MGL had a profit of about Rs 1,300 crore on a revenue of Rs 7,000 crore. Contrast this with Indian Oil Corporation, also a retailer. It posted its best-ever profit of Rs 39,617 crore on a revenue of Rs 8.7 lakh crore, implying a margin of 4.5%.""The official said they should be able to absorb the small increase in operating costs from their ""hefty"" margins.

Delhi Airport issues advisory for passengers as smog reduces visibility

Despite Delhi's air quality index (AQI) hitting a severe level of 428, Delhi Airport assures passengers that flight operations remain normal. Low visibility procedures are in effect, and travelers are encouraged to contact their airlines for the latest flight updates. The India Meteorological Department predicts stronger winds will improve air quality to a 'very poor' level.

Watch: Ghazipur landfill vanishes! Season's first fog deepens smog in Delhi, lowering visibility

Delhi woke to its first thick fog of the season, reducing visibility to zero in some areas and shrouding landmarks like the Ghazipur landfill. This severely impacted air travel, with flights diverted from Delhi Airport due to near-zero visibility. The fog also aggravated respiratory issues for residents already grappling with 'severe' air quality, as reported by the IMD and CPCB.

BATHINDA: There was little respite in air quality in Punjab on Friday as compared to the previous day — amid visibility at the lowest ebb — even as smog and fog remained comparatively for less time in the morning.The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for fog on Saturday.Though it was less hazy than Thursday, the sun was not visible throughout the day.For most part of the day, the AQI stayed under the ‘poor’ category and ‘moderate’ at times.Zero visibility was recorded at Amritsar and Chandigarh airports till 8.30 am.The visibility was recorded at 10 metres in Patiala, 50 metres in Halwara and Faridkot, 100 metres in Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Ludhiana.The worsening air quality is forcing people to remain indoors which is also impacting the election campaigning in Barnala and Gidderbaha.A number of functionaries, belonging to different political parties, said they had to reach out to people at their doorsteps or business establishments with very few people attending public meetings amid worsening air quality.The activity time in the day has shortened as the day starts after 9am and thick smog or fog starts descending early in the evening especially in the rural and outer areas.Advisories have been issued asking older people to avoid venturing out.Commuters have been asked to travel during the day and reach their destinations early in the evening.","Air quality index (AQI) hits a severe level of 428 in Delhi.

Bangladeshi 'infiltrators' poll pitch leaves Jharkhand district on edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladeshi-infiltrators-poll-pitch-leaves-jharkhand-district-on-edge/articleshow/115393589.cms,"PAKUR: A little over three decades ago, Ashraful Sheikh was tilling land in Malpahar in Pakur district of then undivided Jharkhand when he fell in love. So did Jharna Marandi, an Adivasi, who lived there. ""Mohabbat hoye gechhilo amader (We fell in love),"" said Ashraful, who married Jharna, now pradhan of Nartanpur village.Jharna and Ashraful married following Adivasi customs , she never changed her surname, did not convert to Islam. While he offers namaaz five times a day and keeps roza during Ramzan, Jharna follows tribal customs.In nearby Kasila village in Pakur, Sanat Marandi didn't know what to do with his large tract of land. He did not have the wherewithal to put it to use, neither could he sell it as tribal land is non-transferable under the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act. Then, like many others, he found a middle path - to give away a part of the land for a lower price - known as 'Daan Patra' (gift deed) transfer. Shabbir Sheikh, a resident of nearby Sangrampur, ""bought"" a piece of land from Sanat and is running his business.Sanat continued to remain the legal landowner as his land is non-transferable and deposited annual rental to the govt, which in turn is paid to him by Shabbir.As Pakur, which is closest to the Bangladesh border in Jharkhand, heads to polls on November 20 amid a high-pitched campaign revolving around ""ghuspethiyas"" (infiltrators) crossing the border to ""grab land, livelihoods and even Adivasi women"", Jharna, Ashraful, Shabbir and Sanat have suddenly become Pakur's poster boys, the face of what residents called an age-old parampara that is now a part of the social fabric of Santhal Parganas and is also taking care of the region's socio-economic crisis.The issue, which has both NDA and INDIA bloc trading charges and counter charges in Pakur, a Muslim-dominated district which has a history of Mughal settlement, seems to have left residents in pain.""We follow Islam, we speak Bangla and are historically too poor to own any landed property. But we are not Bangladeshis,"" said Muzaffar Sheikh, who runs a mobile phone repair shop in Kasila. Hindus and tribals echo the sentiment.There's fear too after Muslims reportedly pelted Hindu homes with stones in the Taranagar-Ilami area of Pakur in July, after a Muslim boy was beaten up by a mob following reports that he had recorded a video of a Hindu girl and had intended to upload it on social media. The incident found mention in Lok Sabha, with BJP MP from Godda Nishikant Dubey saying Hindus have begun fleeing the area.While allegations of infiltration fly high and thick, locals say people from Bangladesh, who have valid visas, come to India to buy stuff cheap or meet relatives.

""The last such attempt was nine months ago,"" he said. Singh said people are more interested in smuggling goods than crossing the border to settle. ""People from both countries live close to the border, and they have to venture across the fence sometimes, but we keep their identity cards at the checkpost,"" Singh added. ""Allegations of infiltration and branding locals as foreigners are tearing apart the centuries-old, close-knit social fabric,"" said former MLA Aquil AkhtarKey NDA partner AJSU Party, which has fielded its candidate in Pakur, did not include the issue of infiltration in its manifesto.","Pakur, closest to the Bangladesh border in Jharkhand, heads to polls on November 20.

House panel on OBCs likely to push for 'equivalence of posts',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-panel-on-obcs-likely-to-push-for-equivalence-of-posts/articleshow/115394493.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a key parliamentary panel preparing to nudge Centre to ""correct"" the ""flawed"" implementation of "" creamy layer "" for OBCs in certain categories, the focus is set to fall on protracted absence of "" equivalence of posts "" which is at the root of the controversy.Sources said the panel on OBC welfare is likely to push government to ensure ""equivalence"" across its institutions. ""Equivalence of posts"" refers to categorising posts in PSUs, banks, universities, etc, as Group A, B, C, D, like in the government.BJP government had in 2017 announced with much fanfare that ""equivalence"" will be established across government departments and bodies, pending since 1993. But it is understood there is no news about ""equivalence"" having been done by most of the bodies, besides perennial disagreements about ""equivalence"" letters issued by states.Also, while department of public enterprises (DPE) and department of financial services (DFS) did come out with ""equivalence"" for central PSUs and banks in 2017, the categorisation has been mired in controversies.It now emerges that the parliamentary committee , in a special report on ""rationalisation of creamy layer in employment of OBCs"" submitted in March 2019, had questioned ""equivalence"" done by the two key departments.""The committee (members) have felt reverberations of dissatisfaction being experienced on account of 'equivalence' established both by DPE and DFS. The public opinion is, by and large extent, against it. They, therefore, recommend that equivalence set by DFS and DPE should be revisited in letter and spirit of expert committee report and DoPT OM of 1993,"" it noted. However, the government later defended it in the action taken report (ATR) to the committee.The government includes ""salary"" in computing ""income"" of candidates of PSU background, which is contrary to 1993 OM of DoPT that lays down that ""income"" will not include ""salary"" & ""agricultural income"". The panel wants to reiterate that formula for calculating ""income"" for ""creamy layer"" cannot be changed for any category. Also, the panel is mulling a ""model form"" at the national level for determining ""income"" so that errors and subjectivity of implementation could be stubbed out.In its 2019 report, the panel had termed the practice as discriminatory, even citing the judgements of Madras and Delhi HCs, that had slammed Centre over the issue.","""Equivalence of posts"" refers to categorising posts in PSUs, banks, universities, etc, as Group A, B, C, D, like in the government.

"Amid global race, India tests its first hypersonic missile",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-global-race-india-tests-its-first-hypersonic-missile/articleshow/115394765.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant development amid the frenetic race among China, Russia and the US to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, India has tested its first long-range missile that is manoeuvrable mid-flight and flies over five times the speed of sound to evade enemy missile defence systems.The hypersonic missile, designed to carry various payloads for ranges over 1,500km, was ""successfully flight-tested"" from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha at 6.55pm on Saturday, a defence ministry official said.The missile, which flew at Mach 6 speed, was tracked by various range systems deployed in multiple domains. ""The flight data obtained from down range ship stations confirmed the successful terminal manoeuvres and impact with high degree of accuracy,"" the official added.Describing it as ""a historic moment and stupendous achievement"", defence minister Rajnath Singh said the flight-trial has propelled India into a group of select nations that has the capability to develop such ""critical and advanced military technologies"".Former DRDO chairman G Satheesh Reddy told TOI the missile is ""a gamechanger"" with multiple applications in Army, Navy and IAF. ""A missile of this range with hypersonic velocities will provide a decisive edge to India.""The missile, with the speed of a ballistic missile as well as the manoeuvring capability of a cruise missile, of course, will have to be fine-tuned with several tests over the next few years before it is ready for production and deployment. The naval version will be geared towards destroying enemy warships at long ranges with pinpoint precision, an official said.With their capability to defeat existing missile and air defence systems due to super-fast speeds, high-manoeuvrability and low altitudes of flight, hypersonic weapons have become a major focus area for major military powers. The two main types of hypersonic weapons are cruise missiles that are powered by air-breathing engines or ""scramjets"" during their entire flight and ""glide vehicles"" that are launched atop ballistic missiles before gliding to their targets at speeds over Mach 5.China and Russia are ahead of the US in designing aerodynamically manoeuvrable hypersonic weapons for use with nuclear warheads. In July 2021, for instance, China's test of a nuclear-capable missile carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle and warhead had sent shockwaves around the globe.In June 2019, DRDO for the first time tested a hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV), which was to serve as a crucial building block in the development of long-range hypersonic weapons. But the flight trial failed.A second test in September 2020 was successful to the extent that the scramjet-powered ""cruise vehicle"" or HSTDV flew for 22-23 seconds at Mach 6 speed after separation from the ""launch vehicle"" of solid rocket motor of an Agni-I ballistic missile at 30km altitude. While another HSTDV test was conducted in Jan last year, trials of a much longer duration are needed on this front, as reported by TOI earlier.Parallelly, there was a plan to develop a hypersonic version of the already-inducted conventional (non-nuclear) ramjet-powered BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which fly at Mach 2.8 speed with a 450-km strike range, developed with Russia. But this will be an expensive proposition and is not on the cards at present, an official said.","India has tested its first long-range missile that is manoeuvrable mid-flight and flies over five times the speed of sound.

The devastating blaze claimed the lives of 10 newborn babies - three girls and seven boys.According to witnesses, the overheated oxygen concentrator leaked oxygen, accelerating the spread of the flames. ""We are examining other safety lapses, and another team from a different department is looking into management negligence,"" chief fire officer Raj Kishore Rai said, while emphasising the need for better safety measures, such as the inclusion of two doors - one for entry and one for exit - in wards.The ward, designed to accommodate 18 babies, was reportedly overcrowded with 49 infants at the time of the fire. The infants were suffering from conditions such as jaundice and pneumonia.To maintain optimal conditions, equipment like warmers and monitoring devices were running continuously. This placed additional strain on the equipment and led to the fatal overheating. Experts said these devices require periodic shutdowns to prevent overheating, a protocol that was allegedly overlooked by administrators of the govt-run hospital.The autopsies, conducted by three specialised teams of doctors and pathologists, confirmed that all the infants suffered over 80% burns and died within minutes.

The city's air quality index (AQI) was 179. Some areas in Mumbai recorded higher pollution levels.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai woke up to a foggy and hazy Sunday morning, with thick mist enveloping the city and significantly reducing visibility. As of 9am, the Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded by SAFAR-India stood at 179, placing the city in the 'moderate' zone.While this level of pollution is generally not a concern for the majority, people with respiratory conditions, including asthma and heart disease, may experience breathing discomfort.In various parts of the city, the AQI varied, with some areas recording notably higher pollution levels. For instance, the AQI in areas such as Fire Station Malad (276) and BMC Shastri Garden Worli (250) fell into the 'poor' category, while areas like Chembur (55) remained relatively cleaner.The heavy fog reduced visibility to less than 500 meters in some locations, causing high-rise buildings to appear camouflaged in the mist.Despite the poor air quality, many Mumbaikars continued their morning routines, with joggers and walkers seen on Marine Drive, moving through the dense fog.Meanwhile, Delhi faced an even graver air quality situation, with the capital’s AQI soaring to 428 as of 8:00 am, placing it firmly in the 'severe' category. This toxic blanket of smog, caused by a combination of local pollution and stubble burning in neighboring states, left residents struggling with poor visibility and heightened health risks. The capital has been battling high pollution levels in recent weeks, and with air quality in the 'severe' range, concerns over public health continue to mount.As Delhi grapples with worsening air quality, residents have raised alarms over the dangerous impact of continued pollution.

CBSE also coming up with reward system for teachers

NEW DELHI: With learning gaps increasingly being linked to ineffective teaching practices in schools, CBSE plans to launch an 'assessment centre' by June next year to address the challenge, focusing on aligning teaching with student outcomes, elevating education quality, and improving student evaluation.Findings of studies, such as the education ministry's National Achievement Survey, Annual Status of Education Report, and CBSE's Structured Assessment for Analysing Learning, unanimously agree on one point: that the fault of dissatisfactory teaching in schools lies with teachers. The studies have been repeatedly revealing ""significant"" learning gaps and achievements between board scores and actual skills as well as indicating that students are increasingly relying on external assistance like private tuitions or coaching for academic preparation.The way you assess will shape the way you teach, CBSE chairperson Rahul Singh said about the initiative that will directly impact 15 lakh CBSE teachers and is likely to assist teachers from state board schools as well.On the issues pointed out by different studies, he said the proposed centre is a response to these concerns. It aims at supporting teachers in designing effective assessments that not only evaluate academic performance, but also identify individual student competencies. ""The assessment centre will develop state-of-the-art tools capable of creating question papers, administering assessments, scanning responses, and tracking individual student progress. Teachers will have personalised pages on the platform to design assessment items of varying difficulty, tailored to evaluate multiple competencies.""To foster innovation and motivation among educators, CBSE will introduce a reward system for teachers who develop high-quality assessment items. This initiative also seeks to address the challenges faced by teachers in Tier-3 cities, where salaries are often limited between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000.One of the core goals is to instil a sense of healthy competition within classrooms. Teachers will receive training to ensure that their assessment methods drive better teaching practices. The tools for preparing question papers, as well as the assessment tools will also be opened to teachers of other educational boards for free use.","CBSE also coming up with reward system for teachers who develop high-quality assessment items.

'A British Trump' and bureaucratic reforms



India's role in global geopolitics



Praise for Modi and India's economic reforms



Critical view of Europe's economic stagnation



Trump's return to the White House



Global power shifts



Looking ahead



Former British Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss on Saturday called for sweeping reforms in the United Kingdom, including tackling issues within the country's powerful bureaucracy and fostering a movement similar to the ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) campaign in the United States.Speaking at the HT Leadership Summit 2024, Truss said the UK needed a "" British Trump "" to bring about transformative change and addressed various geopolitical and domestic issues.Truss, who served as the UK’s prime minister for 49 days in 2022, said, ""Frankly, I think we need a British Trump. The question is who that individual might be."" She highlighted the need for reforms to reduce bureaucratic resistance, particularly in forging trade deals with India and the US. She argued that entrenched bureaucratic interests were holding the UK back by keeping it tethered to European regulations.""So what I am interested in is how we can create a movement, like the MAGA or Tea Party movements in the US, that leads to significant change,"" Truss said. However, when asked if she would take up such a role, she responded humorously, ""I have already put my fingers in the fire and had them severely burnt.""Truss emphasised India’s growing importance on the world stage, describing it as the ""world’s largest democracy"" with a ""huge leadership role to play in the future of geopolitics."" She expressed optimism about the potential for a stronger India-UK relationship and hoped that the two countries would finalise a free-trade agreement.""This is absolutely a relationship of equals. Both sides will need to make concessions to get the deal done, but the opportunities in technology, defence, and agriculture are immense,"" Truss said. She also praised India’s role in the Quad alliance alongside the US, UK, and Japan, especially in countering the growing influence of China.Commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s historic third term in office, Truss called it a ""massive achievement,"" especially in a global environment where incumbent governments have struggled to retain power. ""It is a testament to the economic reforms taking place in India, and it shows people believe the country is heading in the right direction,"" she added.Truss was critical of Europe’s economic trajectory, lamenting that ""our continent is sinking."" She cited the UK’s GDP per capita as lagging behind the US and advocated for the UK to fully sever its ties with EU regulations to foster growth and innovation.She predicted that dissatisfaction with economic stagnation in countries like France and Germany would lead to major political changes across Europe within the next decade. ""The Trump revolution we are seeing in the US is coming to Europe,"" Truss remarked.Praising US President-elect Donald Trump, who recently won a second term, Truss said his leadership marked a ""revival of US strengths."" She predicted that Trump’s policies and the growing dissatisfaction with left-wing establishments would inspire similar changes in the UK and Europe.Addressing the shifting global power dynamics, Truss expressed concern over the rise of authoritarian regimes, citing Iran, Russia, and China as examples. However, she distinguished India from these powers, describing it as a democracy committed to the rule of law and free speech.""I would distinguish though between India and China. India is a democracy, India wants to see the rule of law protected and free speech,"" Truss said.As the UK continues to navigate its post-Brexit path, Truss underscored the importance of embracing bold reforms and building stronger international partnerships, particularly with India and the US. ""With the Trump presidency , there is an opportunity to reshape how international relations work,"" she said, highlighting India’s potential to play a pivotal role in global debates.","Former British Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss called for sweeping reforms in the UK.

President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller , known for his strong stance on immigration, as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration. Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed the appointment on Monday, congratulating Miller on X, calling him “another fantastic pick by the president.” Miller has been one of Trump’s closest aides since his first presidential campaign and was a senior adviser during Trump’s first term. He has played a central role in many policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including the 2018 family separation policy.Additionally, on Sunday, Trump announced that former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan would serve as the administration’s “Border Czar.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared that Homan would oversee border security , including the Southern and Northern Borders, as well as maritime and aviation security. Homan, a longtime ally of Trump, is also being considered for the role of Secretary of Homeland Security. Trump praised Homan’s expertise in border control, stating he would also oversee deportation policies.Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. According to a Forbes report, the Trump administration’s stance has often been at odds with economic consensus, which suggests that high-skilled immigrants and international students benefit the US economy. The administration worked to decouple study in the US from work opportunities, particularly through H-1B visa restrictions, making it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to stay and work in the U.S. after graduation. The Cruz-Sessions bill, which reflects Miller’s influence, proposed significant barriers for H-1B visa holders, requiring them to work abroad for 10 years before qualifying to work in the U.S., and setting a high minimum salary of $110,000. The bill also sought to restrict Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students, a policy that was nearly eliminated by a Trump administration regulation.Homan and Miller are anticipated to work closely in the upcoming administration to implement these restrictive immigration measures, with Homan overseeing border control and deportation, as well as maritime and aviation security.Miller argues that the H-1B program can lead to American worker displacement and wage suppression. During Trump’s first term, policies were introduced under Miller’s influence to tighten H-1B regulations, including raising denial rates and narrowing the definition of “specialty occupation,” reducing the positions eligible for H-1B workers.These potential changes may discourage U.S. companies from hiring Indian tech talent, limiting opportunities for those seeking employment in the US.Stephen Miller, born on August 23, 1985, in Santa Monica, California, was raised in a Jewish family with a conservative ideology that influenced his early political views and career choices.Miller attended Duke University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Duke, he became a prominent conservative voice on campus, frequently contributing to publications and engaging in political debates. His early career included positions as a press secretary for U.S. Representatives Michele Bachmann and John Shadegg, where he developed a strong foundation in political communication.In 2016, Miller joined Donald Trump’s presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor. After Trump’s election, he took on the role of senior advisor for policy and White House director of speechwriting from 2017 to 2021. Miller played a significant role in crafting Trump’s major speeches, including the inaugural address, and was instrumental in shaping the administration’s stringent immigration policies. He was one of the chief architects of the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and the family separation policy aimed at deterring illegal immigration at the U.S. border.Following Trump’s first term, Miller founded America First Legal , an organization dedicated to advancing conservative legal principles and challenging policies of the Biden administration. Through this platform, Miller continued to impact public policy, focusing on immigration and national security, key areas of his earlier work.In November 2024, after Donald Trump’s re-election, Miller was appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy in the White House. In this role, he is expected to oversee the administration’s policy agenda, especially concerning immigration and national security.Miller is married to Katie Waldman, former press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence. The couple has three children. Throughout his career, Miller has been a divisive figure, gaining praise from supporters for his unwavering conservative principles and facing criticism from opponents for his hardline stance on immigration and involvement in controversial policies.Miller’s career has been marked by several controversies. In 2019, leaked emails revealed that he had promoted articles from white nationalist sources, sparking public criticism and calls for his resignation. Despite these incidents, Miller has retained significant influence within conservative political circles.","President-elect Donald Trump has appointed longtime adviser Stephen Miller as the deputy chief of policy for his new administration.

Could Prince Harry inherit the throne? Nostradamus prediction suggests it's possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/could-prince-harry-inherit-the-throne-nostradamus-prediction-suggests-its-possible/articleshow/115367820.cms,"Prince Harry (Picture credit: Reuters)

A new interpretation of Nostradamus's predictions has suggested an unexpected twist in the line of succession to the British throne. Mario Reading , an expert on Nostradamus, the 16th-century astrologer, has claimed that Prince Harry could become king, potentially replacing his father, King Charles .Reading's 2005 book examines Nostradamus's 447-year-old writings and connects them to current events. The book accurately predicted Queen Elizabeth II's death in 2022 based on cryptic poems written in 1555.Analysing Nostradamus's line, ""a man will replace him who never expected to be king,"" Reading questions whether this excludes Prince William from the line of succession. He proposes, as quoted by Daily Star, that ""Prince Harry, by process of default, becomes king in his stead. That would make him King Henry IX, aged just 38,"" if the Prince of Wales cannot assume the throne.The book also draws attention to Simon Dorante-Day, an Australian man claiming to be the son of King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla.Dorante-Day finds the Nostradamus prediction intriguing, saying, ""It's certainly food for thought, because the prediction makes it clear that someone out of left field would replace Charles as king. I can see why some people would think I fit the bill.""Reading interprets one of the poems mentioning ""King of the Islands"" as referring to a diminished Commonwealth, with King Charles ruling over a smaller realm. The expert also suggests that King Charles's age and potential public disapproval might lead him to abdicate.""Prince Charles will be in his 70s when he takes over the throne, but the resentments held against him by a certain proportion of the British population, following his divorce from Diana, Princess of Wales, still persist,"" Reading asserts, as quoted by the Daily Star. He further speculates that, due to King Charles's age, he might choose to abdicate in favor of Prince William.While Reading's interpretations are based on centuries-old predictions and open to debate, they provide a captivating glimpse into the possibilities surrounding the future of the British monarchy.","Mario Reading's 2005 book examines Nostradamus's 447-year-old writings.

Responding to a video of Lula da Silva’s comments, Musk shared laughing emojis and commented, “They are going to lose the next election.”The exchange comes amid an ongoing clash between Musk and Brazilian authorities, which has reached a boiling point in recent months.

The social network also faced penalties for not appointing a legal representative in the country, a requirement under Brazilian law.The legal saga between Musk and Brazil began in 2024, when the country’s Supreme Court ordered X to comply with local moderation rules. Musk, however, resisted these directives, calling them censorship and even labeling Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who issued the orders, a “dictator.” The platform’s refusal to follow these orders led to a month-long suspension in Brazil in August, which severely impacted X’s operations in Latin America’s largest market.In October, Brazil's Supreme Court allowed social media platform X to resume operations after Elon Musk’s company complied with court orders to moderate content and appoint a local legal representative.X had been suspended since August 2024 for failing to adhere to Brazilian regulations regarding hate speech and misinformation.

'Non-functional CCTV'

Sole survivor stable but cannot speak

What the investigation revealed

Citizens urge authorities to increase patrols

NEW DELHI: Six young lives, including three women, died in a high-speed collision at ONGC Chowk in Dehradun early Tuesday. The MUV they were traveling in rammed into a container truck, leaving the vehicle mangled.The sole survivor, 25-year-old Siddhesh Agrawal, is in stable condition but cannot speak.The victims, aged 19 to 24, included Guneet Singh, Kamakshi Singhal, Navya Goyal, Rishabh Jain, Atul Agrawal and Kunal Kukreja. They were returning from a party hosted by Siddhesh at his residence.Following the gathering, the group decided on a late-night drive, which ended in the fatal crash.Around 1:30am., the MUV, reportedly speeding at over 100 km/h, approached the busy ONGC Chowk.CCTV footage shows the MUV speeding at over 100 km/h and attempting to overtake a luxury car before misjudging the distance and slamming into the truck. The impact was so severe that the MUV's roof was torn off, killing six on the spot.Three of the deceased were students at a private university and one was an engineering graduate.The accident’s precise details remain partially unclear due to non-functional CCTV cameras at ONGC Chowk, offline after a ransomware attack. Dehradun Smart City Limited (DSCL) confirmed that out of 536 cameras in the city, 134 remain non-operational, including the one crucial to this case.Local authorities and police have cited the group’s excessive speed as the primary cause of the crash. The container truck driver fled the scene, though officials suggest he wasn’t at fault.Police investigations have also revealed that the MUV was being driven with an air of casual disregard for traffic norms, a pattern seen among many young drivers in the region.Read more: 'Non-functional CCTV' hampers probe into deadly Dehradun crash; FIR against unidentified person Police are consulting legal experts to determine potential actions in a tragic car crash that claimed six young lives, including three women and left one survivor, Siddhesh Agrawal, critically injured.Siddhesh, the sole survivor, is currently hospitalised with a severe head injury and remains unable to provide a statement.Preliminary investigations have revealed that the accident occurred when a speeding multi-utility vehicle (MUV) collided with the rear left section of a container truck, a blind spot for large commercial vehicles. Authorities have found no fault on the part of the truck driver.Complicating the legal process, the car’s owner, who was driving at the time of the crash, also lost his life in the incident. Police are exploring legal options in the absence of complaints from the victims' families.According to the initial investigation, the MUV, likely a new vehicle without number plates, was traveling from Ballupur Chowk towards Garhi Cantt when it was overtaken at high speed by a luxury car.In an attempt to catch up, the MUV driver accelerated. Meanwhile, a container truck was crossing the intersection at a steady pace.Misjudging the timing, the MUV driver believed they could clear the intersection before the truck passed. However, the speeding MUV collided with the truck’s rear left side, resulting in the fatal crash.In the wake of the accident, citizens are urging authorities to increase patrols near pubs and bars and establish more checkpoints to deter drunk driving.“There should be strict penalties for violators, regardless of their status or influence. Authorities must enforce measures against speeding, ensure helmet usage, and address the issue of multiple riders on two-wheelers. Pub and club owners should also be held responsible if intoxicated patrons leave their premises and attempt to drive,” said Radha Chatterjee, a member of the citizens’ forum.The forum has also advocated for the introduction of 'designated drivers' in Dehradun and has formally written to the director general of police, urging the immediate adoption of these safety measures to prevent further accidents.In response to public pressure, the administration has taken some steps to improve safety. The liquor licence of a five-star hotel on Mussoorie Road, which had been extended to allow 24-hour service, has now been rolled back to its original schedule.","Six young lives, including three women, died in a high-speed collision at ONGC Chowk in Dehradun early Tuesday.

“We’re all being introduced to Netflix”: Jerry Jones emphasized NFL's desire to increase business with the streaming giant in the future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/were-all-being-introduced-to-netflix-jerry-jones-emphasized-nfls-desire-to-increase-business-with-the-streaming-giant-in-the-future/articleshow/115351544.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Jerry Jones stated that the NFL plans to increase business with Netflix

The loss by the Dallas Cowboys over the Philadelphia Eagles could be remembered through a viral moment when glare from the windows of AT&T Stadium caused an incomplete pass from Cooper Rush to CeeDee Lamb. Owner Jerry Jones denied the existence of the problem, going further to lash out at reporters and say that the stadium should be pulled down and that a new one should be constructed.Jerry Jones appeared on the K&C Masterpiece on Friday morning before the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight at AT&T Stadium and his Cowboys' Monday night game against the Houston Texans. Topics include the fight, his Cowboys, whether he's a proponent of the idea that the NFL should play an 18-game schedule, and Jason Witten being an NFL head coach someday.Jerry Jones' stadium hosted the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson event streamed by Netflix on Friday night, ensuring no sun exposure for fighters. Jerry emphasized the NFL's desire to increase business with Netflix, which will partner with the streaming giant for the first time on Christmas Day. “Worldwide coverage with Netflix,” Jones said. “We’re all being introduced to Netflix. We’re so excited in the NFL about Netflix becoming a huge part of our future. This tonight gives us a chance to go to forty, fifty million people and do it from right here.”A similar but distinct deal could be done with Netflix, which could very well obtain rights bundles in the near future. It would focus on more international games, primarily staged in Europe. The NFL hopes to see more international games at 16 in the next five years. The American league's regular season will comprise 18 games. This may be the best time for the million domestic viewers and possibly more around the globe for a Netflix package.Also Read: ""What the f--- is Jerry talking about?”: Travis and Jason Kelce talked about the Jerry Jones vs Sun war at AT&T Stadium Fight fans were shocked by the call to draw the 'curtain' inside AT&T Stadium, especially in apparent contradiction to the claims Netflix wanted the opposite of the mega fight pitting Jake Paul against Mike Tyson. The decision runs contrary to the assertion by owner Jerry Jones that the stadium had been designed to counter sunlight issues that tend to blind his side during home games. According to Jones, Netflix was keen on letting the light in on Friday night, contrary to protests by his players.",Jerry Jones appeared on the K&C Masterpiece on Friday morning before the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight at AT&T Stadium and his Cowboys' Monday night game against the Houston Texans.

PNC Infratech Cut to Hold at ICICI Securities; PT 307 rupees

And, finally..

CLSA and Citi are taking opposite stances on Indian equities . CLSA reversed its tactical overweight on China while raising exposure to India, saying the South Asian nation is least likely to feel the heat from potentially higher tariffs when Donald Trump takes office as US President. The brokerage also pointed out that India offers a relative oasis of forex stability and the recent stock declines have made valuations attractive. Citi isn’t as optimistic. The brokerage recently downgraded Indian stocks, citing concerns about weaker earnings momentum.Foreign investors have sold over $13 billion of Indian equities since October, but local institutions acted as counter-balance with heavy buying. Interestingly, this hasn’t made a big dent in the cash levels of local mutual funds, according to Elara Capital. In October — the worst month for local shares in four years — the total cash reserves across all mutual fund plans fell by just 6.5 billion rupees to 1.68 trillion in October. The reason: a flood of cash into ETFs and index funds, as investors scrambled to ‘buy the dip,’ helped local institutions keep their powder dry.Hindustan Aeronautics bounced off its June lows after posting a mixed bag of quarterly earnings — profit beat estimates, but revenues fell short. While defense stocks are no longer the rage they were at the start of the year, retail investors are not giving up hope on HAL. The 12 billion rupees ($141 million) in outstanding margin-financed positions attests to that. Institutions, however, have been cool to the stock for a few quarters now. Still, analysts at Jefferies see it as a good bet during a market decline, thanks to its strong order book.Office space leasing is gaining traction, even as concerns about a slowing economy linger. The demand is being driven by finance companies and co-working businesses. According to Nuvama, factors like the growth of global capability centers and rapid conversion of special economic zones to non-SEZs have fueled gross leasing activity in the latest quarter.

HYDERABAD: A male tiger, aged between six and eight years, from Kinwat in Maharashtra has entered the core area of the Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) in Nirmal district , Telangana, triggering excitement and concern among locals. The tiger, believed to be in search of a mate, was sighted in various parts of the district over the past month.Initially spotted in Boath mandal forests in October, the tiger later moved through the forests of Kuntala and Sarangapur mandals.Its journey brought it across the Hyderabad-Nagpur NH-44 highway today, where it was sighted again within the Kawal Tiger Reserve. Chief wildlife warden Elusing Meru confirmed that the tiger is now moving toward the Tiryani area of the reserve.The tiger’s movement marks a significant event for KTR, which has struggled to sustain a resident tiger population .Despite being the 41st tiger reserve in the country, created in 2012, and spanning 893 sq km of core area with an additional 1,120 sq km buffer zone, KTR has yet to see permanent habitation by tigers.The reserve has instead witnessed temporary visits by migrating tigers, with the most recent stay being a migrant tiger in the Kaddampeddur range in 2022.However, KTR’s efforts to sustain a tiger population have been marred by challenges, including the poaching of two tigers in 2018.

This is Baldvin, the CEO.

For those of you who did not show up to the meeting this morning, consider this your official notice: you're all fired. You failed to do what you agreed to, you failed to complete your part of the contract, and you failed to show up to the meetings you were supposed to attend and work for.

I will cancel all agreements between us. Please return anything you have, sign out of all accounts, and remove yourself from this Slack immediately.

I gave you an opportunity to make your life better, to work hard, and to grow. Yet, you have shown me that you don't take this seriously. Out of 110 people, only 11 were present this morning. Those 11 get to stay. The rest of you are terminated.

Get the fuck out of my business right now.

Another commented “I guess these 99 were the ones really working, not having time for some bullshit corporate-talk meeting with the CEO.”“Dayum!
