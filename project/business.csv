Who was

CV Raman

Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was born on November 7, 1888, in Tiruchirappalli.

His father, a lecturer in mathematics and physics, provided him with an academic environment from an early age.

In 1902, he enrolled at Presidency College, Madras, and graduated with a BA in 1904, securing the first rank and a gold medal in physics.

He earned his MA degree in 1907 with highest distinction.

Raman's initial research in optics and acoustics—the two fields he dedicated his career to—began during his student years.

At that time, pursuing a scientific career was not considered the most viable option, so in 1907, he joined the Indian Finance Department.

Despite his official duties, he continued experimental research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in Calcutta, where he later became Honorary Secretary in 1919.

In 1917, he accepted the newly endowed Palit Chair of Physics at Calcutta University.

After 15 years at Calcutta, he moved to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, serving as a professor from 1933 to 1948. In 1948, he became the Director of the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, which he founded and funded himself.

In 1926, he established the Indian Journal of Physics and served as its editor. He also played a key role in founding the Indian Academy of Sciences and became its president.

and became its president. In 1930, Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the 'Raman effect.'

He was honoured with the Bharat Ratna in 1954.

in 1954. On November 21, 1970, at the age of 82, he passed away in Bangalore.

India celebrates National Science Day on February 28 each year to honor Sir CV Raman's discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928.This year's theme, 'Empowering Indian youth for global leadership in science and innovation for Viksit Bharat,' highlights the crucial role of young minds in advancing India's scientific and technological progress.In 1986, the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) recommended that February 28 be declared National Science Day by the Government of India. Since 1987, it has been observed annually to honour the discovery of the Raman Effect and foster a scientific mindset across the nation.","India celebrates National Science Day on February 28 each year to honor Sir CV Raman's discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928.

India and

Australia

are fast turning into indispensable partners in the Indo-Pacific, buoyed not just by the success of the Quad grouping but also increasing cooperation in areas like education, defence, people-to-people contact and trade. Australian High Commissioner

Philip Green

sat down for a roundtable with TOI editors on a range of issues, including the return of Donald

Trump

as US prez. Edited excerpts:

Students staying back, and undocumented people

Skilled migration

Australian universities in India and mutual recognition of degrees

Bilateral ties

Scope of a full trade pact

Anti-India extremists in Australia

Adani’s Australia coal project

Trump’s treatment of allies

Future of Quad

Anti-India extremists in Australia

The Australian government and people are very unsympathetic to people who want to arrive without documentation. We have made a huge effort over the last 10 years to virtually remove that as a possibility and... that has helped undergird the support for the regular migration programme.The Australian High Commission in New Delhi is the largest offshore visa processing unit worldwide. We issued halfa-million visas last year [including] about 50,000 students, and about 1,00,000 people for skilled migration. Australia has retained for India the right of people to remain after their study. The length of stay for Indian nationals, as agreed in the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, is as follows:●Bachelor’s degree (including honours) – 2 years●Bachelor’s degree (with first class honours in STEM, including ICT) – 3 years●Master’s (coursework, extended and research) – 3 years●PhD – 4 yearsThe flow of migration between India and Australia continues at a good rate and is very much supported in our society. But there are some areas where, frankly, I’d like to see more. I’d like to make it easier for Indian nurses and other healthcare professionals to make their way to Australia. That’s an area where we have a deficit and you have something of a surfeit.The way in which we think about it is that we have global rules which allow for people to migrate on the basis of skills. Indians tend, more than others, to meet those criteria.Two foreign universities have opened a branch in India and they are both Australian — Wollongong and Deakin . They’re both more than fully subscribed. One more Australian university, University of Western Sydney, has announced that it will open a campus here in Noida. I’m very confident that we will be announcing more Australian universities opening campuses in India before too long.On recognition of degrees, that’s a university-to-university province. And it would not be normal for one university to recognise a whole slate of degrees from another university. What is really good is what is called articulation, when typically somebody does a year or two here in India and then transfers and does a year or two in Australia and gets a degree from both of those universities together. And I think that’s where the future lies.I came here with a mandate from our PM to drive [our relationship] as far and fast as we possibly could. And we’ve had good progress over a year and a bit that I’ve been here. From our perspective, there are three fundamental drivers behind this bilateral relationship: the first is strategic alignment. We see India as indispensable to framing a balance in our region that is sustainable.The second is our economic complementarity. India is the fastest growing big economy in the world. We confidently predict it’ll be the third biggest economy by 2030. [That’s] of particular interest to us... because we’re neighbours [and also] a highly complementary economy. We naturally produce the sort of things that India will need for the next generation of its growth. Energy is obvious. Minerals, especially critical minerals, and skills and training.You will have seen how successful we have been in attracting students from all around the world. And Indians particularly. Now, over 1,30,000 Indians are studying in Australia.The third driver of our relationship is what we describe as a human bridge. The fact that there are now a million people of Indian origin who live in Australia. We’ve only got 26 million on the continent. It’s the fastest-growing ethnic group in Australia. Indian languages are the fastest-growing language group in Australia.The first phase of our trade agreement is going very well and that has given us greater reason to want to conclude a second phase. Part of that would be in order to strengthen the supply chain in important inputs like critical minerals... and encourage our investors and yours to take a bigger interest in each other’s countries. A part of that would be for us to be able to provide a greater degree of cooperation with the Indian agriculture sector.Australia is a democracy and we take the right of peaceful protest very seriously. And people who live in our country are entitled to take their views to the public domain so long as, and only so long as, that doesn’t involve violence or some form of intimidation of other communities. The bit of it that I’m most closely involved in is the protection of Indian diplomatic and consular agents and their premises... and I am confident that our agencies are doing a really good job.The coal project is doing fine for us. It’s producing coal that’s being shipped to India. My dealings with the group have been very largely in the field of renewable energy. We want people to take an interest in our renewable sector. We have a target of 82% of our grid being green just by 2030. That’s up from about 35% just at the start of this govt. Investors from around the world are looking at Australia as an opportunity.I don’t see evidence of the US turning inward. PM Modi was the fourth major leader and there are many others who’ve made their way to the US in the few weeks since President Trump was inaugurated. It was evident President Trump was going to bring a different sort of character to his domestic and international dealings. And that’s the way it is.Our focus is on the Quad continuing to signal that these four democracies [Australia, India, Japan, US] are prepared to expend substantial effort to maintain an order in our region which is free and open and prosperous and resilient. Areas where we will be as active or more active in the future will include maritime domain awareness, critical technology and, particularly, undersea cables, and in fields like responding to humanitarian and other disasters in the region.trade agreement is going very well and that has given us greater reason to want to conclude a second phase.

Ekta ka Maha Kumbh: The dawn of a new era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ekta-ka-maha-kumbh-the-dawn-of-a-new-era/articleshow/118614664.cms,"At Maha Kumbh

The Maha Kumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand Mahayajna of Unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh (Maha Kumbh of Unity) in Prayagraj since January 13.On January 22, 2024, during the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti — devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, Gods and Goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur , a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolized the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit.For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose — taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence.This Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning, and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale.The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Maha Kumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters.I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters — everyone found a way to reach the Sangam.It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of India’s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Maha Kumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving it and are committed to carrying it forward.The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Maha Kumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Maha Kumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society.What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come.More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh.Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh.If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.For thousands of years, the Maha Kumbh has strengthened India’s national consciousness. Every Purna Kumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardh Kumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created move ahead with the times.After 144 years, in this Maha Kumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for India’s development journey. That message is Developed India – Viksit Bharat.At this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Maha Kumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of India’s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India.Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement had identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am gladdened to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India.From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, India’s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, “Maa Ganga has called me.” This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Maha Kumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers.I know that organizing such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see Janata Janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people.Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh , I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Ji , the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Maha Kumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold.The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian.The physical form of the Maha Kumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Maha Kumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come","The Maha Kumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence. It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of India’s youth. It sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118614676,imgsize-811135,width-400,resizemode-4/118614676.jpg"

Poll How Can Universities Better Prevent Student Harassment? Awareness And Support Programs Stricter Policies And Enforcement

DEHRADUN/PITHORAGARH: In a corner of Bhubaneswar, a hostel room has been emptied. Its door, indistinguishable from the others lining the corridor, remains locked. Inside, the personal touches that once marked the space are gone, leaving no trace of the young woman who aspired to build a future there. Yet, beyond these walls, the name Prakriti Lamsal resonates. In Odisha, where students are protesting. In Kathmandu, among Nepal 's student communities, within govt offices and the PMO.Days after Prakriti's death, her father, Sunil Lamsal, searches for answers while holding onto his belief that India will deliver justice for his daughter. ""Since the era of Ramayan, both countries have maintained the roti-beti ka rishta,"" he told TOI over the phone from Kathmandu on Wednesday. ""I cannot be in Odisha for the entire duration of the probe, but I am confident that the Indian govt will do what it needs to.""Also read: Nepal human rights body seeks probe into KIIT-Bhubaneswar student death The roti-beti ka rishta — a bond of livelihoods and marriages that has long blurred the borders between Nepal and India — has long tied the people of the two countries, Lamsal said, repeating, as if to emphasise a hope. Prakriti, 20, was one such daughter. A third-year computer science student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), she had left her home in Bhairahawa, 5km from the Indian border at Gorakhpur, to pursue a future in India. She had told them she'll be back as an engineer.The Lamsals had first heard of KIIT through university-led events in Kathmandu. Prakriti's cousins, Anurodh and Siddhant, were also students there; she and Anurodh in computer science, Siddhant in mechanical engineering. Like many international students, she arrived with ambitions — big but not uncommon. A degree. A job. A better life for her family, especially her little brother she doted on.There were two things, Lamsal said, Prakriti cared about the most: becoming an engineer and looking after her nine-year-old brother, Prayas. She adored him. ""She wanted to get him into the best school, to shape his future. She was shy, but always willing to help others. A bright career has been cut short. I have lost my daughter — she wanted to set an example for others to follow. Those responsible should not go unpunished.""Also read: How a Nepali student’s death sparked chaos at Odisha’s KIIT Prakriti had always been quiet, a little reserved, Lamsal said. But at KIIT, she had spoken up. Twice. She had filed two complaints against a fellow student, alleging harassment. The university responded by calling in both students for ""counselling"". But her family was never informed. ""No action was taken,"" Lamsal said. ""A firm action could have saved her.""On Feb 16, two hours before her death, Prakriti called her mother. They talked about studies, family matters. Nothing seemed amiss. ""There was no indication of the anxiety she was carrying,"" her father said. A few hours later, the family got the news.Afterwards, the community of 1,500-odd Nepalese students at KIIT erupted in protests. More than 500 students were allegedly asked to vacate their hostels following the unrest. The Nepalese embassy stepped in, sending officials to assess the situation and provide support. ""If it weren't for them (the students), this may never have come to light,"" Lamsal said.When Nepal's PM K P Sharma Oli spoke to Prakriti's parents on Tuesday, he promised them what little could still be given: attention, intervention, the weight of Nepal's diplomatic and legal resources. ""This news has deeply saddened me. It has brought grief to all of us. We cannot change what has happened. It was an unfortunate event… An investigation is underway,"" he told them over the phone. He placed his faith in Indian authorities. He assured the family that justice would be done.Prakriti's father listened, stifled sobs, then spoke. ""Many Nepali children are studying in India. We do not want such incidents to recur. Our govt must take proactive steps in this matter,"" he said. He thanked the PM, but it was not just gratitude — it was a warning, a plea. Oli repeated what he had said: ""Nepal is watching this case.""There was another phone call. Nepal's foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba spoke to Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi. She used different words but asked for the same thing — an ""impartial investigation, legal action, accountability"". Nepal's National Human Rights Commission, too, sent its own request, urging its Indian counterpart to investigate Prakriti's death and ensure that it would not become just another case file.""We are waiting, watching,"" Lamsal said. ""Nepal is too.""","Prakriti Lamsal, 20, was a third-year computer science student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology.

'I am a born Hindu': Shivakumar's response to critics in party. Should Congress be worried?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-am-a-born-hindu-shivakumars-response-to-critics-in-party-should-congress-be-worried/articleshow/118608323.cms,"Shivakumar vs Siddaramiah in Karnataka

Why should the Congress be worried?

NEW DELHI: Is the Congress staring at a crisis in yet another party-ruled state? Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar 's holy dip at the Maha Kumbh and his visit to Sadhguru 's ashram for Mahashivratri celebrations, where home minister Amit Shah was also present, have raised the hackles of some Congress leaders triggering a row that may leave the grand-old-party worried.Shivakumar has reacted strongly to criticism over his ""spiritual"" pursuits from a section of the party - with one senior leader invoking Rahul Gandhi's name to attack the Karnataka Congress leader.In a hard-hitting post on X, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary PV Mohan targeted Shivakumar's Coimbatore visit and wrote: ""Thanking for an invitation from someone who mocks RG (Rahul Gandhi), the hope of the nation & aligns with RSS's narratives, while serving as a president of a secular party, it misleads party workers. It is conviction rather than compromise (that) ensures the party's growth. Otherwise, it damages the core.""When asked about objections to his visit from within the party, a combative Shivakumar said: ""I am a Hindu. I am a born Hindu and I will die as a Hindu but I love and respect all religions. Our Congress president's name is Mallikarjun Kharge . Who is Mallikarjuna? It's Shiva only. Should he change his name?""""Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha Foundation came and invited me (for Shivaratri celebrations in Coimbatore). He is from Mysuru. He is a great man and I admire his knowledge and stature but there are many who criticise him,"" he said.The Karnataka deputy chief minister also had good things to say about the Maha Kumbh organised by the Yogi Adityanath government.""My experience regarding Maha Kumbh was very good. I appreciated the way they organised it. It is not a small job. There might be some problems here and there. Trains may have caused problems. I don't like to find faults. It is very satisfactory,"" Shivakumar said.Earlier, responding to allegations of cozying up to the BJP, Shivakumar had called it a conspiracy against him and had invoked Sonia Gandhi to silence his critics.""The Congress party has the doctrine of taking everyone together. Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Indira Gandhi have done the same. I have seen Sonia Gandhi celebrating the Ugadi festival. She has adopted Indianity rather than us. We have such leadership,"" he said countering criticism.In 2023 Shivakumar had lost out to Siddaramaiah for the chief minister's post in a very tight race after Congress's emphatic victory in Karnataka assembly elections. After days of persuasion, he settled for the post of deputy CM while retaining the position of state president. At that time there were reports of a power-sharing agreement under which Shivakumar would have got the top post after two and a half years. However, there was no official confirmation of this.While Shivakumar's supporters have made regular claims about the rotational CM deal, the Karnataka Congress strongman has backed Siddaramaiah to the hilt, especially when the chief minister faced all-round attack over the MUDA land scam. But the fact remains that Shivakumar was a strong claimant for the top post and would want some assurance from the party leadership on it going forward.The Congress did well in the bypolls held last year winning all the three seats where elections were held. Recently the Karnataka Congress president held a meeting with those candidates who had lost the last elections to prepare a blueprint for their victory in 2028. This was perhaps a clear indication of his desire to lead the party in the next elections.It is in this context that Shivakumar's spiritual pursuits could be a message to the party leadership.The Congress has already suffered in several states due to leadership tussle and has even lost its governments.In Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia campaigned vigorously for the Congress in the lead up to the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls in 2018. Following Congress's win, Kamal Nath was chosen as the chief minister. But Kamal Nath couldn't complete his five-year term and had to step down as the chief minister after Scindia and 22 Congress MLAs resigned from the assembly and moved to the BJP.In Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda took complete control of the Congress campaign and in the process several senior leaders were sidelined. Kumari Selja, a prominent Dalit face of the party, objected to this dominance and stayed away for most part of the campaign.In Rajasthan, bittter leadership tussle between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot made headlines for long. Gehlot refused to accommodate Sachin and his supporters. Eventually, Pilot revolted against Gehlot and was on the verge of quitting the party. However, Priyanka Gandhi then intervened and persuaded him to stay back. The faction-ridden Congress eventually lost the assembly elections to the BJP.In Assam, having led the Congress's campaign successfully in 2011, Himanta wanted to be the chief minister. He was seen as the successor to then chief minister Tarun Gogoi. But then came Tarun Gogoi's son, Gaurav Gogoi, on the political scene disrupted the handing over of the baton.Himanta resigned from the Gogoi Cabinet in July 2014, citing ""family-centric"" politics. He joined the BJP and campaigned for the party for the 2016 assembly polls. The BJP came to power in Assam that year and Sarbananda Sonowal was made the chief minister. Five years later, in 2021 when BJP won again, Himanta was made the chief minister.Clearly, the Congress would not want another state to slip away from its hands because of leadership tussle. While Shivakumar may have needed the support of 113 MLAs to become the chief minister in 224-member assembly, he will need the backing of far less number of MLAs to destabilise the Siddaramaiah government.", DK Shivakumar's holy dip at the Maha Kumbh and his visit to Sadhguru's ashram for Mahashivratri celebrations have raised the hackles of some Congress leaders. One senior leader invoked Rahul Gandhi's name to attack the Karnataka Congress leader.

India looks to formalise defence cooperation with EU in Indo-Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-looks-to-formalise-defence-ties-with-eu-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/118609765.cms,"While PM Narendra Modi and visiting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will look to boost ongoing efforts for an India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), both sides are also likely to discuss ways to formalise defence and security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. This is of particular interest to India as it encourages the EU to become more involved in the region, in favour of freedom, transparency and a rules-based order.As the EU leader landed Thursday, describing India as a friend and a strategic ally, government sources here said the visit had been in the works for the past 6 months, or since both leaders were re-elected last year, and has nothing to do with the EU’s strained alliance with the US under President Donald Trump. On her third visit to India, von der Leyen is accompanied by the EU College of Commissioners.According to Indian authorities, the visit will see significant progress in efforts to ramp up cooperation in areas like technology, particularly AI, green energy, space and defence, even if no major agreement is signed after the meeting that will be followed by a joint statement. Modi’s engagement with von der Leyen and the second meeting of the India-EU Trade and Technology Council during the visit is expected to clear the path for the India-EU summit later this year.Ahead of the talks, official sources here said the EU is showing interest in defence cooperation with India in the Indo-Pacific and the 2 sides have had “informal coordination” between their forces so far. “We might have discussions to formalise this cooperation,’’ said a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity. EU adopted an Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021, and has since worked to enhance its engagement with like-minded countries in the region, but it’s often seen as lacking coherence.Significantly though, in 2023, it appointed a military adviser in India for the first time. According to the Indian government, India and EU are strengthening their defence cooperation under the EU co-funded Enhancing Security Cooperation In and With Asia (ESIWA) programme and it’s expected to come up for further discussions on Friday. They have also conducted joint naval exercise in the past, like in the Gulf of Guinea in 2023In an interview to TOI ahead of her arrival, von der Leyen sought a reinforcement of the EU’s defence and security cooperation with India, saying it will work with India and other countries to uphold the rules-based order in the region. While discussing Europe’s focus on Ukraine, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has on several occasions accused the West of looking the other way when the same order was under stress in the Indo-Pacific.Modi and von der Leyen will also discuss recent developments related to Ukraine, particularly Trump’s talks with Russia to end the war in which he didn’t involve either Europe or Ukraine. The EU leader is expected to engage India on the issue, while briefing Modi about her visit to Kyiv this week, Indian officials here reiterated India’s position: both parties must resort to dialogue and diplomacy as no solution can be found on the battlefield.On Friday, the 2 sides will have a plenary session that will be chaired by von der Leyen and Modi, while the College Members will also meet their counterparts individually. According to the EU, India is its largest trading partner, with trade in goods valued at €124 billion in 2023.","EU adopted an Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021, and has since worked to enhance its engagement with like-minded countries in the region.

Mohalla clinic interactions lasted barely 1 min: CAG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mohalla-clinic-interactions-lasted-barely-1-min-cag/articleshow/118611510.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

NEW DELHI: Doctors at AAP's much-vaunted mohalla clinics were spending less than one minute on consultations with a majority of the patients visiting them. Many of these clinics didn't have basic medical equipment such as pulse oximeters, glucometers, X-ray viewers, thermometers and blood pressure monitoring devices.These startling facts have been revealed in a CAG audit report on revenue, economic, social and general sectors and PSUs.The audit has revealed that 18% of the clinics that were evaluated were non-operational for periods ranging from 15 days to 23 months, primarily because of unavailability of doctors, resignations and de-empanelment. The audit found that 41 of 218 clinics across four districts - North East, South, South West, and West - remained shuttered when the evaluation was carried out. Medical services were significantly affected as 70% of patients who visited the mohalla clinics between Oct 2022 and March 2023 received less than one minute of consultation.The report has also raised serious concerns about the availability of medicines as 74 clinics that were reviewed were found to have failed to maintain complete stocks of the 165 medications listed in the essential drug list (EDL).Supply chain difficulties were particularly evident in medicine distribution with frequent unfulfilled or partially completed orders from suppliers. The audit noted that numerous EDL medicines were either not procured by the central procurement agency or not delivered by vendors despite orders having been placed. Delayed deliveries, ranging from three to six months, further disrupted the clinics’ ability to provide timely care.CAG observed that laboratory services were completely unavailable across Delhi’s clinics from November 16, 2022, to December 14, 2022, with no alternative testing arrangements. After 10 years of AAP’s rule, only 53% of the planned mohalla clinics were established with just 38 facilities added in their second term, falling short of their healthcare goals. AAP administration’s 2015 promise of establishing 1,000 clinics to improve healthcare accessibility remained unfulfilled. The CAG report flagged significant project delays.Despite a budget allocation of Rs 35.16 crore for constructing primary health centres between 2016 and 2023, the administration used only 28% (Rs 9.8 crore) of the allocated funds. By March 2023, directorate general of health services, Delhi govt, had established only 523 clinics, well below the 2017 target of 1,000 clinics.The report has revealed significant deficiencies in essential facilities across numerous mohalla clinics. Out of 81 clinics assessed, various shortcomings were identified: 10 operated without potable water supply, 24 lacked air-conditioning for proper storage of medicines and injections while 21 had no toilet amenities. Six clinics functioned without proper examination tables, 29 were found without fire extinguishers and 12 were inaccessible to differently-abled persons.Furthermore, 20 clinics failed to provide privacy screens for patients during consultations. CAG has pointed out that DGHS had issued an order on Feb 26, 2018, mandating quarterly visits by chief district medical officer’s (CDMO) teams to all mohalla clinics in the district. In Dec 2019, DGHS directed CDMOs to inspect at least one clinic monthly, verifying 10% of OPD entries through patient contact numbers.The monitoring teams were tasked with checking staff punctuality and reviewing various registers, including pharmacy indent, stock and balance, OPD, laboratory and daily consumption. Additional focus areas included proper medicine usage and ensuring all prescriptions carried authorised signatures and stamps from empanelled doctors. The monthly visit reports were to be submitted to the state nodal officer. The audit revealed that only 175 inspections (1.5%) were completed against the required 11,191 inspections of 218 clinics in selected districts between March 2018 and March 2023.","Doctors at AAP's much-vaunted mohalla clinics were spending less than one minute on consultations.

Another brick in union wall: 'Harassed' Kerala owner to shut kiln,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-brick-in-union-wall-harassed-kerala-owner-to-shut-kiln/articleshow/118611931.cms,".

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Trade unionism has dropped a brick on Left-governed Kerala's claim to ease of doing business, with a 57-year-old woman kiln owner in Parassala on the brink of winding up her venture after even a high court order failed to protect her from harassment at the hands of headload workers.Pushpakumari and her husband Thankappan A, a retired state transport corporation employee, have been running the kiln at Chenkal - ""brick"" in Malayalam - for around six years. She alleges that a group of headload workers owing allegiance to CPM-affiliated CITU and Congress-backed INTUC have been obstructing the business in a bid to extract what she says are unreasonable wages.The couple, hailing from Pazhayakada near Thirupuram, recently moved Kerala high court against the unionised workers and obtained an order barring them from disrupting operations at the kiln. The court also directed police to provide protection to the owners and their business.Pushpakumari said little had changed despite the court's intervention, forcing her to contemplate giving up on her kiln. The defiant workers allegedly tore a copy of the court order in front of police. Last Tuesday, they allegedly didn't allow Pushpakumari's regular staff to work.""Not all headload workers create such problems; it is just a group of men with several criminal cases against them. Our employees load 1,000 bricks for Rs 480, receiving an extra Rs 30 as a bonus. The headload workers demand Rs 800 and more,"" she said.Pushpakumari said several orders were cancelled due to delay in delivery caused by the unionised workers.""The court ruled in our favour, but the workers are politically influential, and even police advised us to compromise for the sake of the business. Some of the more aggressive workers threatened to kill us."" Police said the dispute would be resolved soon. ""We have warned the trade union workers not to create any problem,"" an officer said.Kerala organised a global investor summit recently, where chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan promised to remove all obstacles for industrialists and arrange all facilities required for a start-up ecosystem to thrive. Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan, too, extended support in the interest of the state's economic growth.","Pushpakumari and her husband Thankappan A, a retired state transport corporation employee, have been running the kiln at Chenkal for around six years.

"In North India, short winter doesn't always lead to searing summer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-north-india-short-winter-doesnt-always-lead-to-searing-summer/articleshow/118612415.cms,"Representative image

Does an early end to winter imply that summer is likely to be a scorcher? TOI analysed 54-year temperature data for north India to find that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a hotter than usual month of April.

NEW DELHI: Winter has ended early in north India and February in Delhi is set to be among the three warmest in the last 15 years. So, does the early conclusion of winter indicate a long and scorching summer ahead? Contrary to the general view, data from past years shows that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a searing summer in north India.TOI analysed monthly average maximum temperatures in north India since 1971 and picked the 10 warmest months of Feb during this period. In five of these years, the corresponding months of April were indeed warmer or significantly warmer than normal but in the other five, April temperatures were either close to normal (four years) or below normal (one year).These two months were chosen for the analysis because Feb is the last month of winter in north India, while April marks the beginning of full-blown summer conditions in the region. March is usually a month of transition.""There is no direct one-to-one relationship between temperatures in Feb and April. Temperatures in these two months depend on multiple factors, including largescale signals such as presence of El Nino (or La Nina) and synoptic features such as the frequency, intensity and duration of western disturbances,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general of India Meteorological Department Trends in recent years exemplify the absence of a link between temperatures in Feb and April. In 2023, north India experienced record heat in Feb but April was cooler than normal. Feb that year was the warmest since 1901, with the average maximum temperature 3.5 degrees above the mean during 1971-2024.However, April that year turned out to be the coolest in eight years, with average maximum temperatures nearly 1 degree below the mean during 1971-2024.The reverse happened in 2022. April of that year in north India was the hottest on record, while temperatures in Feb were close to normal.""In the years when a strong El Nino (or La Nina) prevails, there can be a link between temperatures in the two months. This year, however, we have a weak La Nina that's not expected to influence temperatures,"" Mohapatra said.Another factor that's increasingly playing a role in making both months hotter in general is climate change. ""The past couple of decades have been the warmest on record. So, because of climate change, the probability of any month being warmer than in the past is high,"" said the chief of IMD, which is scheduled to release its forecast for the months of March, April and May soon.","TOI analysed 54-year temperature data for north India to find that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a hotter than usual month of April.

SC lists riders for arrests by GST and Customs staff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-lists-riders-for-arrests-by-gst-and-customs-staff/articleshow/118611897.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Customs and GST authorities had the power to carry out arrests but could not do so without adhering to the safeguards provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for personal liberty of the accused.Writing the main opinion, CJI Sanjiv Khanna said the safeguards penned in the Arvind Kejriwal vs Enforcement Directorate judgment relating to arrest under Prevention of Money Laundering Act would apply to arrests under Customs and GST Acts . The court introduced safeguards for those facing charges under these Acts.The SC said officials could not take custody of people for alleged violation of the two laws without informing them of the grounds of arrest and laying out ""reasons to believe"" that he had committed an offence under these revenue laws. It also said a person who apprehended arrest was entitled to seek anticipatory bail .A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices M M Sundresh and Bela M Trivedi found force in the argument of the petitioners that assessees were compelled to pay tax as a condition for not being arrested and said this was unacceptable and violative of rule of law.""We would observe that in case there is a breach of law, and the assessees are put under threat, force or coercion, the assessees would be entitled to move courts and seek a refund of tax deposited by them. The department would also take appropriate action against the officers in such cases,"" the bench said.Importantly, the bench upheld amendments in 2012, 2013 and 2019 to the Customs and GST Acts classifying certain offences as cognisable and non-bailable while rejecting the challenge to their validity by as many as 280 petitions. It also upheld powers of Customs and GST officials to summon an assessee while clarifying that mere summoning did not make the person an accused.“The challenge to the constitutional validity, as also the right of the authorised officers under Customs and GST Acts to arrest, are rejected and dismissed with elucidation and clarification on the pre-conditions and when and how the power of arrest is to be exercised,” it said.Reading in the entire arrest procedure under CrPC, along with additional safeguards created by SC judgments, into Customs and GST Acts, the bench said as these two laws didn’t come with complete codes on search and seizure, and arrest, provisions of CrPC would apply unless expressly excluded.Writing the main opinion, CJI Khanna said safeguards it had penned in the Arvind Kejriwal vs ED judgment relating to arrest under PMLA would apply to arrest procedures under Customs and GST Acts. Customs and GST officials now must follow the following procedure — a. The officer must have material in his possession (to effect arrest); b. Based on such material, the authorised officer should form and record in writing, ‘reasons to believe’ that the person to be arrested is guilty of an offence punishable under the concerned Acts; c. The person arrested, as soon as may be, must be informed of the grounds of arrest — and also the doctrine of proportionality (mere questioning will serve the purpose or is arrest essential).SC said, “Courts may employ this fourpart doctrinal test in their examination of the legality of arrest as arrest often involves contestation between the fundamental right to life and liberty of individuals against the public purpose of punishing the guilty.” The bench said unbridled exercise of power to arrest without warrant (for cognisable and non-bailable offence, the police must obtain an arrest warrant from court) could result in arbitrariness and errors in decision-making and such errors made by Customs and GST officials could lead to a frustration of constitutional and statutory rights of the arrested person.",Customs and GST authorities had the power to carry out arrests but could not do so without adhering to the safeguards provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) The court introduced safeguards for those facing charges under these Acts.

NEW DELHI: The health ministry has issued a warning against prolonged use of earphones and headphones, suggesting that these devices, whether wired or wireless, should not be used for more than two hours daily. If used for this duration, frequent breaks should be taken during listening sessions.In a letter to all states/UTs for further dissemination to the public, director general of health services Dr Atul Goel said recent studies have shown prolonged and excessive exposure to loud music and other sounds through personal audio devices can lead to irreversible hearing damage. ""Evidence has shown there is a temporary shift of hearing acuity (ability to hear and distinguish sounds) after prolonged use of an earphone/headphone or ear plug, which is generally a high-frequency hearing loss that is not easily noticeable in day-to-day life,"" he said.""If unsafe use of earphones/headphones/earplugs is prolonged and persistent, this shift of hearing acuity can be permanent and result in permanent hearing loss. Certain individuals may also develop a persistent ear ringing or buzzing noise called tinnitus because of prolonged unsafe use,"" the senior official said.The young population, Goel said, is at a higher risk due to unsafe listening practices. The rise of online gaming culture is also putting children at risk of exposure to the impulse of high decibel sounds, he added.""Once hearing is permanently impaired, normal hearing will never be restored by hearing aids or cochlear implants. Further, persistent tinnitus from a young age can lead to diverse psychological issues including but not limited to depression,"" he added.","The health ministry has issued a warning against prolonged use of earphones and headphones.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin Thursday alleged that attempts by BJP-led Centre to impose Hindi were only a facade and that the real intention was to spread Sanskrit.In his third letter to DMK cadres hitting out at Centre for its alleged plans to impose Hindi, Stalin contended that wherever a three-language formula was adopted, Hindi-Sanskrit had taken precedence. If TN too adopts such a formula, it will end up advancing BJP's Sanskritisation agenda, Stalin alleged.According to him, over 25 languages like Maithili, Braj, Bundelkhandi, Bhojpuri, Avadhi, Kannauji, Garhwali, Kumaoni spoken in various north Indian states were destroyed by Hindi-Sanskrit. Since Tamil fought against direct invasion, BJP wants to impose Hindi-Sanskrit through NEP, he claimed. ""Neither Hindi nor Sanskrit can ever destroy the greatness of Tamil. Fascists have always targeted a people's language and culture to erase their identity,"" Stalin said. He said the fact that Tamil survived without being corrupted by north Indian languages makes it a thorn in the flesh for those in power, forcing them to change their tack.Stalin said Sec 4.17 of NEP clearly promoted Sanskrit at all education levels, relegating Tamil and other languages to secondary status. Only in Sec 4.18, Tamil is mentioned. ""Even that says languages, including Tamil, shall be taught only in addition to Sanskrit.""""Push for a monolithic Hindi identity is what kills ancient mother tongues.

"Science unified Ganga’s three separate streams, restored river’s course",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/science-unified-gangas-three-separate-streams-restored-rivers-course/articleshow/118607566.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maha Kumbh 2025 will be remembered for many things, but one engineering marvel stands out — the unification of the Ganga’s three separate streams into a single, cohesive flow. Through a 2.5-kilometre dredging project , the river’s course was restored, reclaiming land equivalent to 1,000 tennis courts. This first-of-its-kind intervention expanded the Mela premises by 22 hectares, ensuring better organisation and accessibility for millions of devotees.The Ganga had previously shifted its course, splitting into three streams that affected its purity and created logistical challenges for the Kumbh Mela. Officials noted that the uneven riverbed led to the formation of sand islands, making the task particularly complex. “We relied on advanced technology and our expertise in water body management to overcome what initially seemed like an insurmountable challenge,” an irrigation department official said.Anil Garg, principal secretary, irrigation and water resources department, highlighted the scale of the achievement: “This feat of reclaiming land equivalent to 1,000 tennis courts and expanding the Sangam nose to accommodate two lakh pilgrims at a time is unparalleled,” he said.This success was driven by a blend of technology, engineering, and human determination. “The project had to be completed within a two-month window from mid-Oct to Dec 31. We deployed three high-capacity dredging machines — two with a capacity of 250 cubic metres and one with 350 cubic metres — to remove over six lakh cubic metres of sand,” explained Gaurav Chopra, managing director of Cleantec Infra.Chopra also highlighted the unique challenges posed by strong river currents and fluctuating water levels. “To maintain stability, dredgers were anchored to pontoon bridges, allowing continuous 24/7 operations in shifts. Despite setbacks like broken pins and shifting machinery, the team stayed focused,” he said. With guidance from chief minister Yogi Adityanath and strategic input from IIT-Guwahati, an additional dredger was deployed to accelerate the work.The unified flow of the Ganga was successfully achieved just in time for Maha Kumbh 2025, creating a more structured and expansive Sangam area for devotees. This not only enhanced the spiritual experience but also ensured smoother logistics for the event’s large crowds.In addition to merging the streams, the project involved levelling and preparing the ground with five lakh metric tonnes of sand, making the Mela area more accessible. Officials and experts believe this project could serve as a replicable model for managing other water bodies across the country.","The Ganga had previously shifted its course, splitting into three streams that affected its purity and created logistical challenges for the Kumbh Mela.

MEERUT: Trilok Kumar died twice in six months. That is confirmed by official records from two govt institutions. The insurance payout came twice, too.Days after TOI uncovered an elaborate insurance scam originating in UP and running into hundreds of crores - where insurance agents, claims officials, panchayat authorities and even doctors and bank staff conspired and colluded to insure the dying and sometimes the dead - investigators now say the fraud runs deeper than initially thought. They say many more agencies and institutions are involved and that from the initial eight states from which they have nabbed some of the accused, they are now looking at ""12 states and counting"".They cited the case of Trilok Kumar in Delhi as an example. The first time Kumar died, it was cancer. That's what MCD records and receipts from the Nigambodh Ghat cremation office in Delhi showed. A resident of Shaktinagar, Kumar was cremated on June 19, 2024, with an official Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) document listing cancer as the cause of death.

1971 census should be basis for delimitation: Karnataka CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1971-census-should-be-basis-for-delimitation-karnataka-cm/articleshow/118611937.cms,"Karnataka CM (File photo)

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Thursday warned against using the latest population figures for delimitation exercise, saying it would severely disadvantage southern states. He demanded that Centre clarify whether the exercise would be based on the 1971 Census, as was done previously, or on updated population data.""It is evident that if delimitation is carried out based on the latest population ratio, it will be a severe injustice to southern states. To prevent such unfairness, previous delimitation exercises were conducted using the 1971 Census as basis, following constitutional amendments,"" Siddaramaiah said in a statement.His remarks came a day after Union home minister Amit Shah said southern states would not lose a ""single parliamentary seat"" because of delimitation.However, Siddaramaiah dismissed this claim as ""untrustworthy"", suggesting it was either misleading or aimed at creating confusion. He argued that Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh had successfully controlled their population growth over past 50 years, while making significant strides in development. This was not the case with some states in north, he added.""As a result, if delimitation is based on the latest Census, southern states, including Karnataka, may see a reduction or stagnation in number of Lok Sabha seats, while northern states will gain more seats. In either scenario, southern states will bear the loss. Is the home minister unaware of this?"" he asked.Citing studies on the impact of delimitation, Siddaramaiah claimed Karnataka's Lok Sabha seats could shrink from 28 to 26, Andhra's from 42 to 34, Kerala's from 20 to 12, and TN's from 39 to 31, if the process is based on the latest Census. In contrast, UP's representation could increase from 80 to 91, Bihar's from 40 to 50, and Madhya Pradesh's from 29 to 33. ""If this is not injustice, what is?"" he questioned.Terming the move as ""unacceptable"", Siddaramaiah emphasised that either the 1971 Census should continue to be the basis for delimitation or the overall number of Lok Sabha seats should be increased proportionally. ""Looking at the extraordinary enthusiasm shown by Union govt for delimitation, it appears the real intent is to punish people of southern states for resisting his party's dominance,"" he alleged.The CM accused Centre of systematically undermining Karnataka's interests, pointing to disparities in tax distribution, GST allocations, disaster relief funds, and amendments to UGC regulations. He criticised BJP and JDS MPs from the state for failing to challenge these policies and remaining ""silent like slaves"".Siddaramaiah urged Kannadigas to set aside caste, religious and political differences to oppose the move, and said discussions were underway with other southern states to launch a coordinated movement against the proposed delimitation plan.","Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah warns against using latest population figures for delimitation exercise.

Unilateral impounding of passport illegal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unilateral-impounding-of-passport-illegal-sc/articleshow/118611906.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court used its exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to grant divorce to a man repeatedly assaulted by his wife in the US during a two-month-old marriage and quashed as ""illegal"" the decision of authorities to impound his passport after the woman lodged several FIRs in India against him.The ferocity of the assault prompted the man to call the police in the US twice within two months, after which the woman was charged with second-degree assault. They lived together for a total of 80 days - they got married on Feb 19, 2018 - before she came back to India and refused to return to the US.In India, she allegedly threw her mother-in-law out of the matrimonial home, forcing her to seek shelter in her daughter's house. She lodged eight cases against the man and his mother. The authorities, taking note of the criminal cases, unilaterally impounded the man's passport.The man then moved SC. A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta found that the marriage was filled with acrimony and that there is no child born from the wedlock.Though the woman argued that she did not want divorce or alimony, the bench said the marriage appeared to have broken down irretrievably and that no useful purpose, emotional or practical, would be served by continuing the soured relationship. ""This is a fit case warranting the exercise of the discretion conferred under Article 142(1)..."" it said and ordered the husband to pay Rs 25 lakh as permanent alimony.Referring to the impounding of the man's passport on the mere ground that the woman had filed several cases in various courts, the bench said, ""we find that the impounding the man's passport under Section 10 of the Passport Act, 1967, was carried out without granting him an opportunity to be heard. This clear violation of the principles of natural justice renders the act of impounding the passport ex facie illegal"".","Supreme Court used its exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to grant divorce to a man.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has sought trial records of the 26/11 terror attack case from a Mumbai court in anticipation of Pakistan-born Canadian and ""key conspirator"" Tahawwur Hussain Rana 's expected extradition from the US.The court of principal district and sessions judge Vimal Kumar Yadav made the request on Jan 28 while hearing a plea by National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) for all documents relating to the case. These records had been transferred to Mumbai for use in adjudicating multiple cases linked to 26/11.A week earlier, America's apex court dismissed Rana's final appeal, clearing the path for his extradition. Previously, another court determined that he could be extradited to India for his alleged involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack orchestrated by Pakistan-headquartered terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Rana is suspected to be one of the brains behind the coordinated terrorist assault across multiple locations in Mumbai that resulted in over 174 casualties. He was previously convicted in the US for supporting LeT. His alleged involvement includes assisting David Coleman Headley (alias Daood Gilani), a US citizen born to American and Pakistani parents. The latter was arrested in the US in Oct 2009.Based on investigation by US authorities, Rana knowingly supported Headley's connections to LeT and created a false identity for him to travel to India for reconnaissance ahead of the 2008 attack. NIA's investigation revealed Rana's role as a co-conspirator, leading to his arrest by FBI on Oct 27, 2009. He was subsequently charged under various sections of Indian law.Rana established the ""Immigrant Law Centre"" in Mumbai allegedly as a front and travelled across India with his wife Samraz Rana Akhtar in Nov 2008. He stands accused of being in regular contact with Major Iqbal, another co-conspirator, whilst carefully concealing their Pakistani connection. Being an army deserter, Rana received assurances of assistance through Major Iqbal via Headley.Headley secured a multiple-entry business visa to India, with Rana facilitating its extension. The conspirators chose Headley for his Western appearance and American background, with Rana providing necessary support to obscure the actual purpose of their activities.",A Delhi court has sought trial records of the 26/11 terror attack case from a Mumbai court.

MUMBAI: Bombay high court has refused to direct the transfer of Reserve Bank of India bonds to the mother and wife of a man who has renounced the world and become a Jain sadhu . ""This court, in its writ jurisdiction under Article 226, will not enter the arena of disputed claims between the parties,"" said Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale, asking them to seek civil remedy before an appropriate forum.In their petition, the 77-year-old mother and 48-year-old wife of the sadhu said M was the karta of a Hindu Undivided Family. ""Renouncing worldly affairs amounts to civil death of M and as such all his properties would devolve upon his other legal heirs, namely the petitioners."" M's son and daughter have also taken sanyas.He holds bonds worth about Rs 56 lakh and the date of maturity is Sept 18, 2026. As per RBI guidelines, the bonds are not transferable except in the case of natural death.Prior to taking sanyas, M sought to know from HDFC Bank the procedure for transmission of RBI bonds to his legal heirs. However, the bank did not accept sanyas as civil death and refused to transfer the bonds. After M took sanyas, his mother and wife applied to the bank, but it failed to transfer/transmit the bonds to them. HDFC's advocate referred to the bank's reply that there is no declaration of M being a karta. The date of maturity is Sept 18, 2026, and as per RBI guidelines, the bonds are not transferable except in the case of natural death. There is no succession certificate/probate submitted and no conclusive evidence to corroborate the claim that M and his children have taken sanyas.In their on February 21 order, the judges agreed with HDFC's advocate that ""whether M and his children took sanyas and renounced the world is a mixed question of facts"". They cited a Delhi HC decision that states 'the mere fact that a person declares he has become a sanyasi or describes himself as such or wears clothes worn by sanyasis would not make him a sanyasi'. Also, he 'must perform necessary ceremonies without which renunciation will not complete'.","Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale asked them to seek civil remedy before an appropriate forum.

This was the largest train operation for any festival in the railway’s history. To run more passenger trains, all freight trains were shifted to the Dedicated Freight Corridors, officials said.Vaishnaw, who visited Prayagraj, lauded the seamless coordination between different departments. He said while the original goal was to operate around 13,000 trains, the railways managed to run 16,000 trains without any problems. “Every train operated effectively, guaranteeing devotees a hassle-free trip,” he said.Praising the efficient use of the Prayagraj junction area and the logistical arrangements, the minister said an example has been set and this can be emulated for future large-scale gatherings, including the upcoming Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh melas. “The experience gained during the historic Maha Kumbh will be of great help in managing future events,” he said.Officials said over 200 trains were put into service in the Kumbh area. These were either trainsets or had engines on both sides to avoid shunting operations. Vaishnaw said the railways undertook extensive infrastructural and operational enhancements across nine key stations in Prayagraj, adding second entry points, 48 platforms and 21 foot-over bridges to streamline movement.For better surveillance, 1,186 CCTV cameras were installed with over 100 having facial recognition technology. Drones were also deployed for crowd control. To manage peak-hour congestion, 23 permanent holding areas were created, while multilingual announcements were made and leaflets in 23 languages were distributed to passengers. The railways had set up 554 ticket counters, including 151 mobile unreserved ticketing counters and a QR-based system.The national transporter carried out the doubling of the line between Banaras and Prayagraj, which included construction of a new bridge on the Ganga river.","Three years of preparation ahead of Maha Kumbh with an investment of Rs 5,000 crore to upgrade infrastructure and streamline maintenance helped the railways to run over 17,000 trains in 45 days.

AD's Adductor Agony: Will the Mavs' Gamble Pay Off?

In the swirling vortex of NBA trades and superstar shakeups, the Dallas Mavericks threw a cosmic curveball, swapping Luka ""Magic"" Doncic for the enigmatic Anthony Davis . Now, just weeks into this bold experiment, the basketball gods seem to be testing Dallas's resolve. AD, the man meant to propel them to championship contention, is sidelined, leaving fans clutching their popcorn and wondering: did they just trade a symphony for a silent film?The villain in this particular drama? An adductor strain. Think of it as a pulled groin but with a more technical, doctor-y name. The adductors are a group of muscles in your inner thigh, crucial for bringing your legs together. For a basketball player, they're essential for lateral movement, explosive drives, and, well, not collapsing in a heap during your debut game. Davis, unfortunately, experienced this exact scenario, dominating the Houston Rockets before a sudden, agonizing exit.Since then, the Mavs have been navigating a choppy sea, going 3-3, a record as lukewarm as a day-old latte. The latest chapter, a clash against their former golden boy, Luka Doncic , and the Lakers , ended in a 107-99 defeat, a stark reminder of what they traded away. But amidst the gloom, a glimmer of hope: Jason Kidd , the Mavs' stoic coach, offered a cautiously optimistic update on Davis's recovery.""He feels good, but just in conversation he says he feels great,"" Kidd revealed, a phrase that could either mean Davis is ready to leap tall buildings or just really enjoyed his post-workout smoothie. Kidd further added that Davis is engaging in light shooting and weight-lifting, which are signs of a player slowly but surely returning to form. The positive vibes are flowing, with Kidd noting AD's upbeat spirit.ALSO READ: Why Kevin Durant Said NO: The Real Reason He Killed Potential Golden State Warriors Trade The Mavericks' ""win-now"" mantra hangs heavy in the air. This trade wasn't a long-term project, it was a desperate gamble, a high-stakes poker hand played with the team's future. The pressure is on Davis to return and justify the seismic shift. Until then, Dallas fans are left to wonder if their grand experiment will become a masterpiece or a cautionary tale, all while hoping AD's adductor strain heals faster than a plot twist in a soap opera.","Dallas Mavericks traded Luka ""Magic"" Doncic for Anthony Davis.

Carmelo Anthony has made a bold pitch for Kevin Durant to return to his roots and finish his career with the Washington Wizards . During a recent episode of his 7PM in Brooklyn podcast, the former NBA star openly advocated for Durant to leave the Phoenix Suns and bring his talent back home to D.C. It has stirred the pot of discussion among fans. Kevin Durant , who was born in Washington D.C., and raised in Maryland, has long been linked to a return home at some point in his career. While the Wizards are currently struggling with a league-worst 10-48 record, Carmelo Anthony believes that the personal satisfaction of playing in front of family in D.C. would be worth more than chasing another title.""KD to the Wizards,"" Anthony declared. ""I would like to see him in the Wizards. That's just me personally with my s---. Go back home. End it back home. You ain't gone go chase. You ain't going to go with these other teams that's out there. You've already got your rings. Go to the Wizards. Bring the energy back to D.C. You're home.""Melo further shared his thoughts on the potential of the Wizards' roster, mentioning key stars like Marcus Smart, Khris Middleton, Alex Sarr, and Bub Carrington. He further argues that Durant could be the catalyst for a new era in Washington basketball.While the idea of Durant joining the Wizards might seem far-fetched given their current state, the situation in Phoenix is far from stable. The Suns, who were expected to be championship contenders this season, have been underwhelming. They entered Thursday’s slate of games with a 27-31 record, teetering on the edge of the Play-In Tournament.NBA insider Brian Windhorst recently dropped a bombshell regarding Durant’s tenure with the Suns, stating, “They’re going to trade him, and he knows that.” According to reports, Phoenix actively explored trade opportunities before the deadline, reaching out to teams like the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Memphis Grizzlies. However, Durant’s enormous contract and the difficulty of integrating a superstar midseason made a trade not quite feasible.Durant himself acknowledged the challenge of being traded midseason during an appearance on The Draymond Green Show. “A player like me, I cost a lot. Me going into your team in the middle of the season is going to be a big blow to any team I’m going to.” This suggests that if a move is coming, it’s more likely to happen in the offseason when teams have more flexibility to construct a blockbuster deal.Also Read: Why Kevin Durant Said NO: The Real Reason He Killed Potential Golden State Warriors Trade The Suns' front office is reportedly considering its long-term strategy, and trading Durant may be the only way to pivot from a failing experiment. “The only way to begin a pivot out of this team that has failed is to trade Kevin Durant,” Windhorst added.",Carmelo Anthony advocates for Kevin Durant to bring his talents to the Washington Wizards.

According to the lawsuit, Top Rank founder Bob Arum personally assured Keane that his efforts to secure major fighters for the company’s exclusive deal with ESPN would be rewarded with 10% of the earnings from each fighter whom he helped sign in. However, duBoef eventually ceased payments, which has also encouraged ESPN's recent decision not to renew its broadcasting partnership with Top Rank.A key revelation in the lawsuit involves the financing of the Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder fight. The lawsuit alleges that due to lack of funds required to cover the fight, duBoef had to secretly rely on financial assistance from Kinahan, an alleged organized crime boss rumoured to be linked to Fury. The filing claims that duBoef authorized Keane to collaborate with Kinahan but instructed him to ensure ESPN remained unaware of the arrangement. The lawsuit notes that Kinahan had been publicly identified by Irish media as the leader of a drug cartel, which could put Top Rank’s standing with ESPN at stake, had the connection been exposed.“DuBoef authorized Keane to move forward [with Kinahan], but he admonished Keane that ESPN could not find out that Kinahan was involved. According to duBoef, the Irish press had reported that Kinahan was the head of a drug cartel, and if duBoef were linked to Kinahan, ESPN might be forced to terminate their deal,” the suit, filed by Los Angeles lawyer Patricia Glaser, alleges.The legal battle came at a time when Top Rank’s long-standing relationship with ESPN is set to end in August and awaits renewal. Besides duBoef’s inability to match his stepfather Arum’s influence and credibility as Top Rank’s leader contributed to the company's difficulties in maintaining its stack of elite fighters.Keane asserts that duBoef never disputed his unpaid earnings but chose to withhold payments to conserve Top Rank’s financial resources following ESPN’s decision to part ways. Neither duBoef, Top Rank, nor Keane have publicly commented on the lawsuit.Also Read: Michael Bisping Drops a Bombshell: Magomed Ankalaev's Victory Outshines Anything Alex Periera has Done This case marks another legal challenge for Top Rank, which was previously sued by boxer Terence Crawford over breach of contract and allegations of racial bias.","Top Rank and ESPN contract at stake following legal turmoil involving Todd duBoef and organized crime boss Daniel Kinahan.

The Lakers could have difficulty offering that without some sort of sign-and-trade. With the Timberwolves' financial situation being the reason they would potentially let go of Reid, the two sides would likely need some help in any potential endeavor.”

Sidney Crosby trade talk: Brian Hayes suggests summer move over deadline deal

Could Crosby have a change of heart before the trade deadline?

Speculation is growing about Sidney Crosby possibly leaving the Penguins to join the Avalanche and reunite with Nathan MacKinnon . TSN analysts Carlo Colaiacovo and Bryan Hayes fueled the discussion after Crosby played alongside MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.During a TSN Hockey segment, analyst Carlo Colaiacovo asked insider Bryan Hayes whether Sidney Crosby might reconsider his future with the Pittsburgh Penguins after playing alongside Nathan MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.Crosby and MacKinnon, both former No. 1 picks from Nova Scotia, share a close bond and have showcased strong on-ice chemistry. While Crosby has been a lifelong Penguin, speculation grows about whether he might one day reunite with MacKinnon in the NHL.""I'm, I'm not sure it happens before the trade deadline,"" Hayes said on TSN's OverDrive. ""It feels like an off season move, or sit right like now, if he's gonna eventually conclude.""Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both from Nova Scotia, have a well-known friendship, and their on-ice chemistry has often led to speculation about a potential team-up in the NHL.MacKinnon recently secured his long-term future with the Avalanche by signing an eight-year, $100.8 million contract, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league. With a strong core that includes defenseman Cale Makar, the Avalanche are considered top Stanley Cup contenders, and adding Crosby would only increase their chances of success.Talking about winning with Nathan MacKinnon in the 4 Nations Face-Off, Hayes mentioned that if Crosby contemplates a trade, he would prefer it to be handled discreetly and swiftly.""That's the thing. And... if you're gonna get to that conclusion, do it as quickly as you can,"" Hayes said. ""Yes, like, if it's in the back of your mind that you kind of realize, all right, I don't think I can finish this dance. It's gonna get worse before it gets better.

Bitcoin is on SALE

I AM BUYING

WHY: The problem is not BITCOIN

THE PROBLEM is our Monetary System and our criminal bankers.

America’s bankrupt. Our debt including social programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, including our $36 trillion debt is over$230 trillion.

Our US Bonds are a joke. When countries such as Japan and China stop buying our bonds….inflation will go through the roof….our economy and the US dollar will crash.

Those are a few of the reasons why…. When Bitcoin crashes…. I smile and buy more.

Bitcoin is money with integrity.

Fake money is a thief.

Elon Musk's repeated warnings on America going Bankrupt



Elon Musk's repeated warnings on America being on the verge of bankruptcy may have just got support from the renowned businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki . In a post on Twitter, Kiyosaki blamed problems with America's ""Monetary System"". He went on to add America’s bankruptcy. While he and Elon Musk may not entirely be on the same page, the duo seem to agree on problems with the US economy.Kiyosaki made the strong statement, asserting his faith in Bitcoin, which saw a sharp decline on Thursday February 27. Bitcoin saw a sharp decline on Thursday, falling to $85,000 — a 22% drop from its all-time high of $109,114 recorded on January 20. As the cryptocurrency market experienced renewed volatility, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, reaffirmed his bullish stance on Bitcoin, viewing the price decline as an opportunity to buy more.He highlighted systemic economic weaknesses in the U.S., pointing to the nation’s mounting debt levels as a significant risk. Kiyosaki also warned of a potential collapse in the American. bond market, raising concerns that foreign nations like Japan and China may stop purchasing U.S. debt. According to him, such a scenario could drive inflation to extreme levels, destabilizing the economy and weakening confidence in the U.S. dollar.""Our US Bonds are a joke. When countries such as Japan and China stop buying our bonds, inflation will go through the roof, our economy and the US dollar will crash,"" he wrote.

Many analysts believe these factors are pushing investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.After a strong run in the markets, sentiment took a hit this week when Trump confirmed that a 25 per cent tariff on Mexico and Canada would take effect on 4 March, with an additional 10 per cent levy on China to follow.Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $109,241 on 20 January, the day of Trump’s inauguration, but has since plunged almost 25 per cent as traders unwind bets placed on the back of his election.The sell-off gained momentum during Friday’s Asian trading session, driven by growing concerns over Trump’s aggressive trade policies and broader economic instability. His pledges to slash taxes and immigration also raised fears of renewed inflation, which could compel the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped to $79,525.88 during early Asian trading on Friday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
