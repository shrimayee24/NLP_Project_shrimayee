NEW DELHI: A British F35B fighter jet, grounded at Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram airport since June 14 due to a hydraulic system malfunction, is set to depart on Tuesday after successful repairs by a UK technical team including manufacturer representatives.The aircraft, which belongs to the UK navy aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales, was forced to land at the city airport during a routine flight when it encountered technical problems preventing it from landing on the ship.The repair work took approximately one week to complete, with technicians addressing the issues in the jet's hydraulic system before clearing it for departure.The Royal Navy's stealth aircraft, operating with the Carrier Strike Group from HMS Prince of Wales, executed an emergency landing citing fuel concerns and unfavourable weather during standard operations. The IAF assisted in ensuring a secure landing and provided subsequent fuel and logistics assistance.A formal statement from the IAF confirmed their complete awareness of the situation and their assistance rendered for ""safety reasons"". Royal Navy technical personnel from the carrier group attempted repairs unsuccessfully.Officials from Britain acknowledged ongoing repair efforts whilst expressing gratitude to Indian authorities for their assistance.British authorities announced plans to transfer the F-35B stealth aircraft to the local MRO facility for necessary repairs.A specialist British team comprising 21 personnel, including aviation engineers, arrived at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. The £85-million aircraft was subsequently relocated from the tarmac to a hangar.Airport officials confirmed that the sophisticated British F-35B fighter aircraft is scheduled to depart on July 22, following successful repairs, after more than a month's stay at the airport.","British F35B fighter jet grounded at Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram airport since June 14 due to a hydraulic system malfunction.

"Rapid test kits for Hepatitis B, Sickle cell anemia to be available at PHCs, government decides",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rapid-test-kits-for-hepatitis-b-sickle-cell-anemia-to-be-available-at-phcs-government-decides/articleshow/122825931.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big move to ensure timely detection of common diseases like Hepatitis B, sickle cell anemia and syphilis at primary level, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has suggested that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose them should be available at rural health centres. This includes the Ayushman Arogya Mandirs Sub-Centres and primary health centres.Sources said the move follows feedback received from national programs and other subject experts, who highlighted the growing importance of providing rapid diagnostic tools at primary health facilities for early detection and treatment.Many RDTs available in the market have not been included for the want of robust evidence. Officials said these tests can be reconsidered for inclusion in the National Essential Diagnostics List (NEDL) once the required data is comprehensively assessed and verified, the officials said.The ICMR, which is the apex health research agency, released the NEDL in 2019 to set basic standards for availability of diagnostic facilities at health facilities in the country. Recently, it has been updated to include RDTs and other requirements.For example, the 2019 NEDL had kept certain diagnostic tests under the ""hub-and-spoke"" model at primary health centres (PHCs). A hub and spoke model in a laboratory setting is a healthcare delivery strategy where a central, well-equipped ""hub"" laboratory provides specialized diagnostic services, while smaller, less equipped ""spoke"" laboratories handle routine and less complex testing, with samples often transferred between the two.However, the updated equipment list which was released recently suggests these tests should be available at the PHCs itself. This will do away with the need for sample transfer to hubs thereby making it possible to diagnose and treat a wider array of conditions at the lower level, the ICMR says. The updated NEDL also addresses the issue of new nomenclature of healthcare facilities with Sub-Centres now referred to as Ayushman Arogya Mandirs.The revision of the National Essential Diagnostics List (NEDL) was undertaken through extensive engagement with a wide range of stakeholders. The process began with an open call on the ICMR website inviting suggestions on the existing Essential Diagnostics List. This was followed by four rounds of consultations to discuss the suggestions received with the relevant experts and stakeholders. Subsequently, the draft revised list was deliberated with representatives from State NHM and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The final list incorporated the feedback and recommendations received in all consultations, officials said.","The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has suggested that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose them should be available at rural health centres.

MUMBAI: Heavy rain lashed Mumbai onMonday morning, crippling movement across key parts of the city.In the 24-hour period ending at 8 am on Monday, the island city recorded an average rainfall of 23.45 mm, the eastern suburbs received 36.42 mm and the western suburbs got 50.02 mm rainfall, civic officials said.In contrast, Colaba received just 11.2mm, highlighting the uneven distribution of showers across the city.The heavy overnight showers led to waterlogging at several low-lying areas in the city and suburbs.Commuters bore the brunt of the downpour, especially during the morning rush hour. The Andheri subway had to be closed due to severe waterlogging, causing further traffic snarls in the area.Motorists complained of slow traffic movement on both the Eastern Express Highway and the Western Express Highway due to rain and other reasons during the morning rush hours.Some commuters also complained that locals trains were running with a little delay.According to IMD officials, the rainfall is linked to a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, which has intensified rain activity along Maharashtra’s coastal belt, including Mumbai and surrounding regions.While no red alert has been issued for Mumbai, the IMD has urged residents—especially office-goers and commuters—to exercise caution, particularly in the evening hours when isolated heavy showers are expected.For the next 24 hours, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a generally cloudy sky with moderate spells of rain in Mumbai and suburbs, with the possibility of thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds at isolated places.After a high tide of 3.91 metres at 9.19 am, another one of 3.38 metres was expected at 8.37 pm.

MUMBAI: Senior education officers in the Maharashtra govt have been accused of misusing a govt-run payments portal to create fake teacher IDs and siphoning funds. Fraudulent Shalarth IDs were also created for unqualified individuals, who were allegedly hired after paying a bribe of Rs 20 to 30 lakhs each to school management and education department officials.The IDs given when a teacher is recruited, are needed to access salary and other benefits. The deputy directors of education of Mumbai and Nagpur zones allegedly, between them, created thousands of fake IDs. Govt estimates the scope of the scam to be Rs 2,000-3,000 crore. Some arrests have already been madeFormer deputy director of education Ram Pawar explains, ""Once there is a vacancy and the school has selected the candidate, the school issues an appointment order. The candidate then takes this appointment order to the deputy director of education of that zone, who approves it and provides the candidate with a Shalarth ID and password. This ID is used to access salary and benefits—without it, the candidate cannot be paid. "" The Shalarth portal also houses financial information and personnel records for all education staffers.According to Ram Pawar, the authority to issue Shalarth IDs rests with the deputy director of education.Officials at the office have created bogus IDs and drawn salaries for fictitious individuals, for whom bank accounts were opened using fake credentials and fake photographs. Officials have also been accused of issuing Shalarth IDs and hiring unqualified people for posts of teachers and headmasters for a bribe.Scope for manipulation is minimal in govt-run schools as employment records are available for scrutiny within the administration and due to the regulations which staff need to follow. But govt oversight of the records of aided schools is limited. This allowed those managing the portal to appoint unqualified individuals and even create fake posts and withdraw salaries in their name.Misuse of the portal has been reported across the state. In Nagpur, unqualified teachers, headmasters, and other staff were accused of holding fake Shalarth IDs that were obtained after paying bribes to school management and education department staffers. Deputy director of education for Nagpur, Ulhas Narad, has been arrested. In many cases, teachers and other school staff helped govt officers to create fake IDs and bank accounts for a share of the loot. Also, govt staff demanded bribes to give eligible teachers backdated dues and increments after promotion (see report alongside).On July 18, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced in the state assembly that the Shalarth ID scam could amount to Rs 2,000-3,000 crore. He announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team to probe the ID scam. Dada Bhuse, the state school education minister, has meantime suspended the Mumbai deputy director, Sandeep Sangave.Former deputy director Ram Pawar says, ""An earnest effort must be made to examine records. The process cannot be top-down. Whatever the upper management decides, the onus must be on field officers who need to conduct rigorous checks.""","Shalarth IDs are needed to access salary and other benefits.

Poll Should documents like Aadhaar and voter ID be accepted for verifying electoral roll eligibility? Yes, they are valid and widely used No, stricter verification is needed

NEW DELHI: Disagreeing with Supreme Court ’s prima facie view that Aadhaar card , voter ID card and ration card be considered valid documents for its SIR of electoral rolls in Bihar, EC told the court that they cannot be relied upon — Aadhaar is just an identity proof; there are a large number of fake ration cards floating around in the country; and relying on existing voter cards would make the special drive futile.It, however, said citizenship of a person will not terminate on account of not being part of the electoral rolls. In a voluminous affidavit filed in SC late evening, the poll panel also said that there was no violation of any law and fundamental rights of voter in conducting the exercise and pleaded the court to dismiss the petition filed by 11 opposition parties, NGOs and some residents of Bihar for scrapping of SIR and holding the Nov assembly election on the previous electoral rolls which were revised in Dec.It said Section 9 of Citizenship Act has no application to SIR exercise. “Under the SIR exercise, citizenship of an individual will not terminate on account of the fact that he/she is held to be ineligible for registration in the electoral rolls,” the affidavit said.Justifying its decision not to treat EPIC as proof of eligibility for inclusion in the electoral roll, EC said, “The conceptual and procedural integrity of a de-novo revision would stand undermined if EPICS, which are merely reflective of prior entries, are used to validate entries in a roll that is required to be constructed anew.The EPIC, being a by-product of an earlier electoral roll, cannot substitute the verification process mandated for fresh preparation. ”EC said given the widespread existence of fake ration cards, it has not been prescribed within a list of 11 documents to be relied upon for screening eligibility.“And it is submitted that Aadhaar is merely a proof of identity of a person.A person who seeks to claim a benefit can utilise an Aadhaar card to show he/she is who he/she claims to be... There are restrictions on usage of Aadhaar to check eligibility under Article 326,” it said.","EC says there are a large number of fake ration cards floating around in the country.

NEW DELHI: Holding Chanda Kochhar , former CEO of ICICI Bank , guilty of receiving bribes of Rs 64 crore through her husband from Videocon group, an appellate tribunal here in an order dated July 3 observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of Rs 300 crore to the Videocon group.“The history given by the appellants (ED) has been narrated and supported by the evidence in the light of the reference of the statements under Section 50 of the PMLA Act which are admissible and can be relied upon. The allegation made by the appellants stands because on paper ownership of NRPL is shown to be of V N Dhoot (CMD of Videocon group) but according to him also, the entire control of the company was of Deepak Kochhar (Chanda Kochhar’s husband). Thus, the allegations were made for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan to Videocon group of industries,” the tribunal said in its order.The appellate tribunal slammed the adjudicating authority that had earlier in Nov 2020 given relief to the accused in releasing the attached assets worth Rs 78 crore.“The adjudicating authority has ignored the material facts while drawing the conclusions which are coming out on the face of the record and, therefore, we cannot endorse the finding of the adjudicating authority going against the record and ignoring the relevant facts.Thus, we find substance in the allegation of the appellants for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon group and thereupon, a sum of Rs 64 crore was transferred to NRPL, a company managed by Deepak Kochhar and, in fact, he was the managing director of the said company. The factual issues narrated above clarifies that the appellants have taken up the matter to justify the attachment of the property,” the tribunal said, justifying the ED’s attachments.The tribunal noted that the sanction of a loan of Rs 300 crore by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group where Chanda Kochhar remained part of the committee was against the rules and policy of the bank. “The issue remains about the transfer of Rs 64 crore by Videocon group through its entity SEPL to NRPL day after the disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank,” it said while validating the evidence produced by the ED.

Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's view that FIRs for monetary disputes should not invoke criminal law? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: Invoking criminal law by filing an FIR for recovery of money by a person is an abuse of the process of law as it is a civil dispute, the Supreme Court said and expressed frustration over HCs allowing it in violation of its rulings.The apex court stated this while quashing criminal proceedings initiated by a production house against Bollywood filmmaker Shailesh Kumar Singh, who had produced ‘Tanu Weds Manu’, over a monetary dispute.“How many times HCs are to be reminded that to constitute an offence of cheating, there has to be something more than prima facie on record to indicate that the intention of the accused was to cheat the complainant right from the inception. The plain reading of FIR does not disclose any element of criminality,” a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said in an order on July 14.Indicating that HCs have virtually turned a deaf ear to its recent orders holding that such cases come within the ambit of civil suits, the bench referred to its verdicts which had settled the issue. It said SC in Aug had stated that a mere breach of contract cannot give rise to a criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right from the beginning of the transaction.“Every act of breach of trust may not result in a penal offence of criminal breach of trust unless there is evidence of a manipulating act of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the person may seek his remedy for damages in civil courts but, any breach of trust with a mens rea, gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well,” it had said.Advocate Sana Raees Khan, appearing for producer Shailesh Kumar Singh, told the court that no criminal offence was made out against him and criminal prosecution should not be allowed to be used as an instrument of harassment. Agreeing with her, the bench quashed the FIR and also expressed shock on how the Allahabad HC dealt with the case by directing him to pay Rs 25 lakh to the complainant. SC also directed them to go for mediation.“We fail to understand why the HC should undertake such an exercise. The HC may either allow the petition saying that no offence is disclosed or may reject the petition saying that no case for quashing is made out. Why should the HC make an attempt to help the complainant to recover the amount due and payable by the accused. It is for the civil court or commercial court, as the case may be, to look into in a suit that may be filed for recovery of money or in any other proceedings,” SC said.“We are quite disturbed by the manner in which the HC has passed the impugned order. The HC first directed the appellant to pay Rs 25 lakh to the respondent, and thereafter, directed him to appear before the Mediation and Conciliation Centre for the purpose of settlement. That’s not what is expected of an HC to do in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution or a miscellaneous application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of FIR or any other criminal proceedings,” SC said.It said that “what is expected of the HC is to look into the averments and the allegations levelled in the FIR along with the other material on record, if any. The HC seems to have forgotten the well-settled principles as enunciated in the decision of this court”.",Supreme Court: Invoking criminal law by filing an FIR for recovery of money by a person is an abuse of the process of law as it is a civil dispute.

NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to a J&K police constable being subjected to barbaric torture by his colleagues at Joint Interrogation Centre in Kupwara, and being named as an accused to shield the perpetrators of the crime, Supreme Court Monday directed CBI to take over the case and immediately arrest the culprits. It also directed the Union territory govt to pay Rs 50 lakh as compensation to the victim.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said the way in which the constable was tortured for six days in 2023 had shocked the conscience of the court and expressed lack of confidence in the UT police conducting an impartial probe, given that they tried to shield the perpetrators of the offence by naming the victim as an accused.""The injuries caused to the appellant during his illegal detention, particularly the complete mutilation of his genitalia, use of pepper/chilly powder and electric shocks on his genitalia, are grave reminders of the inhuman torture meted out to the appellant while detaining him illegally. The cumulative effect of all these facts is deeply shocking to the conscience of this court,"" the bench said.""The entire material collected in enquiry conducted so far, including all related documents, medical records, CCTV footage, forensic evidence, and case diary, shall be immediately handed over to the competent officer of CBI.The director, CBI, shall constitute a SIT headed by an officer not below the rank of superintendent of police to investigate this matter. The police officials found responsible for the custodial torture shall be arrested forthwith and not later than a period of one month from today.

Pahalgam debate not set for first week, Cong slams govt

Turbulence ahead

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Monday set the tone for the govt’s response to the opposition’s demand for a discussion on “Operation Sindoor” and the Pahalgam attack by declaring India's retaliation against terrorist camps deep inside Pakistan a “100% success”.Modi was speaking against the backdrop of the opposition's plans to stage protests in the two Houses as well as the govt agreeing to hold a debate: a rhetorical skirmish which, as per the decision of the business advisory committee, an all-party affair, will pan out for at least 16 hours next week. As soon as the Lok Sabha kicked off proceedings, Congress and its allies demanded that the discussion be held straightaway.Congress also demanded that the Prime Minister personally respond to US President Donald Trump’s claim to have leaned on India to get it to negotiate the suspension of Operation Sindoor In his address, Modi emphasised that the armed forces achieved the success despite him having publicly warned them days by amplifying the intent to “raze the terrorists to the ground”.“This monsoon session should be a victory celebration, a vijayotsav (triumph). The entire world has witnessed the strength of Bharat's military capabilities. During Operation Sindoor, the Indian armed forces achieved their objectives with 100% success.Within just 22 minutes, the mission neutralised its target right inside the enemy’s territory. I had announced this during a programme in Bihar, and our armed forces accomplished it within a very short time,” the Prime Minister said.Congress members also insisted that leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi be permitted to speak, shouting slogans when he was disallowed by Speaker Om Birla, who said he could do so after question hour. Pleas by defence minister Rajnath Singh and parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju that the govt was ready to debate all the issues and that it was for the BAC to work out the date and duration of the debate also failed to cut ice.BJP, for its part, also sent the message that it was not going to chicken out of a fight. As soon as PM Modi entered the Lok Sabha after his media address, BJP and allied MPs greeted him with slogans of “Operation Sindoor” and “Bharat Mata Ki Jai. In his customary remarks to the media on the inaugural day of the session, PM emphasised the global recognition of India’s indigenous defence capabilities.“When I meet world leaders, they express keen interest in Bharat’s homegrown defence equipment. A unified voice from Parliament celebrating this victory will inspire our armed forces and boost research, innovation, and manufacturing in the defence sector, creating jobs for our youth,” he said.Reflecting on the atrocities in Pahalgam, Modi praised all-party delegations that exposed Pakistan’s role in global terrorism. “Setting aside party differences, representatives from various states travelled to world capitals, successfully highlighting Pakistan as a hub of terrorism. Their efforts, in the national interest, created a positive atmosphere and opened global doors to India’s perspective,” he said. He said the success of astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla’s historic mission was another reason for Parliament to celebrate.Congress has slammed the govt for not scheduling the discussion on Pahalgam attack and subsequent events in the first week, and criticised prime minister Narendra Modi for “not giving importance” to the first session after the dastardly terror attack in J&K.Deputy leader of opposition in LS Gaurav Gogoi said the govt did not put Pahalgam and other issues before the business advisory committee which met on Monday afternoon to decide the business of the lower house. He said the govt did not fix any date or time for the discussion, describing it as “salt on the wounds of the grieving families”.The opposition continued with its protest on the opening day of the session and forced adjournment of LS even when the House met after the BAC meeting, indicating that it is bent on maintaining pressure, at least for the coming days.",PM Modi declares India's retaliation against terrorist camps deep inside Pakistan a “100% success’ Opposition demands discussion on Pahalgam attack and subsequent events in the first week.

TCS Benching Policy Impact

TCS Benching Policy: Industry Impact

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends. Several TCS employees appear to be taking to social media platforms like Reddit to express their concerns about their role and future in TCS.The newly implemented benching guidelines effective from June 12 restrict the non-billable period to 35 days annually, beyond which employees could face professional setbacks or possible job loss.According to an ET report, employees have reported various challenges, including urgent project searches, assignments in mismatched skill areas, unsuccessful client interviews, and difficulties securing projects in preferred locations.A concerned Reddit participant was quoted as saying, ""This is the first step towards employment rationalisation based on utilisation. Brace for layoffs.""A new recruit shared, ""I have recently joined TCS and training was conducted in Java. Now, it's not even a month on bench and RMG is pressuring me to join a *** support project, far from Java and Python.""However, the financial daily could not verify the veracity of the posts on Redditt.Explaining the revised bench policy, TCS chief executive and managing director K Krithivasan told Times of India: ""It's always been expected that associates take responsibility for their careers. While HR supports project placement, we also expect associates to proactively seek new assignments after completing existing ones. What you're seeing now is simply a more structured version of what's long been in practice. We aim to minimise bench time.""Also Read | Infosys vs Cognizant fight gets uglier! Why are the two big IT firms battling it out in the US? Explained The company prioritises substantial investment in employee development. ""Once we've made that investment, we work to ensure associates are deployed,"" he said. ""While preferences are considered, projects are driven by client needs, not personal choice. We deploy based on training, demand, and skill alignment. If gaps exist, we work to close them before deployment.""When questioned about TCS withholding salaries for staff on extended bench periods, Krithivasan offered no direct response.The exact impact on the TCS workforce remains uncertain. Based on industry data, approximately 15-18% of employees at major Indian IT companies typically remain on bench. TCS, which leads India's IT sector, currently employs around 613,000 individuals.Last week a workers' rights organisation approached Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, requesting immediate intervention regarding TCS's bench policy, which they described as ""inhumane,"" ""exploitative"" and mentally taxing for technology professionals.Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) submitted a formal complaint to the minister, claiming that TCS is pressuring benched employees through termination threats and withholding experience certificates if they cannot secure project assignments within specified timeframes.Also Read | TCS gives out variable pay! Over 70% employees to get 100% variable; no decision yet on salary hikes ""These are not non-performing employees, but skilled professionals who find themselves temporarily without allocation… Instead of support, they are met with suspicion, coercion, and threats,"" NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja said in the letter.Some staff members are however backing TCS' decision, noting that numerous employees have stayed unassigned for extended periods, turning down offered projects. These individuals have used their unallocated time for pursuing additional qualifications whilst not contributing to the organisation's productivity.""This may help TCS trimming some seriously underperforming resources, those stuck on TCS like a leech,"" a Reddit user posted.The IT sector anticipates significant changes as artificial intelligence (AI) begins to automate routine operations.""We expect IT companies to become stricter with their bench policies due to the soft business environment and AI-led demand for advanced skill sets,"" Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend told ET. He observed that staff expenses are notably affecting company profit margins.The stringent bench policy implemented by TCS might influence other IT firms, as managing bench strength becomes increasingly challenging due to AI-driven productivity improvements making it harder to reassign entry-level engineers, according to industry specialists.""Tech companies must continuously align their employees' skill sets with evolving client needs. By revisiting their bench policies, organisations are encouraging employees to reskill and stay relevant in high-demand areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and digital engineering,"" said Nitin Bhatt, technology sector leader at EY India according to the financial daily’s report.""Going forward, tenure and grade-based promotions and merit increases will likely be replaced by assessments of skills proficiency and competencies required to take on new roles,"" he added.Also Read | ‘Character assassination’: Delhi HC asks Wipro to pay Rs 2 lakh for defamation of ex-employee; termination letter full of ‘stigma and insinuations’","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends.

New Income Tax Bill: Changes in TDS refund claims while filing ITR?

(AI image)

New Income Tax Bill: Top Changes Suggested by Panel

New Income Tax Bill 2025: A Parliamentary committee reviewing the new Income Tax Bill has recommended that the Ministry of Finance should permit individual taxpayers to file returns and claim TDS refunds beyond the deadline without penalties. The committee also advocated for tax exemption on anonymous contributions to trusts serving both religious and charitable purposes.The report, presented in the Lower House by Select Committee chairperson Baijayant Panda of BJP, scrutinised the Income Tax Bill, 2025, which aims to replace the Income Tax Act, 1961.Regarding TDS refund claims by individuals not otherwise required to submit tax returns, the committee proposed eliminating the Income Tax Bill clause that requires mandatory filing of I-T returns by the deadline, PTI reported.The committee notes that the present requirement to submit returns solely for refund purposes could unintentionally result in legal action, especially affecting small taxpayers whose earnings are below taxable limits but have experienced tax deductions at source.""In such scenarios, the law should not compel a return merely to avoid penal provisions for non-filing. The committee, therefore, recommend to remove sub-clause (1)(ix) from Clause 263 to provide flexibility for allowing refund claims in cases where the return is not filed in due time,"" the report specified.According to a PTI, the committee sought clarification regarding the taxation of anonymous donations to Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) that serve both charitable and religious purposes, requesting the removal of existing ambiguities.The panel expressed opposition to the taxation of NPO 'receipts', stating it contradicts the Income Tax Act's principle of real income taxation. They advocated for the reintroduction of the term 'income' to ensure taxation applies only to the net income of NPOs.Noting the considerable differences in how anonymous donations to registered NPOs are treated, the committee recommended tax exemption for both religious and charitable trusts, acknowledging that many organisations operate with dual objectives.The committee highlighted an oversight in the Bill regarding religious-cum-charitable trusts, despite its aim of textual simplification. This omission could negatively affect numerous organisations within India's NPO sector.Under Clause 337 of the Income Tax Bill, 2025, all registered NPOs would face a uniform 30 per cent taxation on anonymous donations. The only exception would apply to organisations established exclusively for religious activities.This represents a significant shift from Section 115BBC of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The current legislation offers broader exemptions, where anonymous donations to trusts or institutions established for both religious and charitable purposes remain untaxed. However, this exemption excludes cases where such donations are specifically allocated to universities, educational institutions, hospitals, or medical facilities operated by the same trust or institution.The current regulation appropriately acknowledges these ""religious-cum-charitable"" institutions as a separate and legitimate category qualified for benefits on unnamed donations, recognising that such establishments frequently receive funds through conventional methods where identifying donors is unfeasible.""The committee strongly urge the reintroduction of a provision analogous to the explanation found in Section 115BBC of the 1961 Act,"" stated the Select Committee report.","The committee also advocated for tax exemption on anonymous contributions to trusts serving both religious and charitable purposes. The report was presented in the Lower House by Select Committee chairperson Baijayant Panda of BJP. The Income Tax Bill, 2025 aims to replace the Income Tax Act, 1961.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122814006,imgsize-17190,width-400,resizemode-4/122814006.jpg"

NPS vs UPS : Which of these options should you go for?

The answer depends on the age and risk profile of the individual.

If you are below 35…

Young employees below 35 years should stay with the NPS. Young investors can take advantage of the long investment horizon and higher equity exposure (up to 75%). The compounding effect of equity over 25-30 years is likely to yield a larger retirement corpus than any assured return plan.

However, one needs to be comfortable with market fluctuations and not get jittery when markets go through a bear phase or remain flattish for longer periods. Over the long term, these ups and downs get smoothened out.

If you are between 35 and 50 years…

If you are close to retirement…

NEW DELHI: The extension of the deadline for choosing between the New Pension System (NPS) Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) to September 30 has given government employees some more time to decide. The government has also clarified that the maturity corpus and pension from the UPS will get the same tax treatment as that from the NPS.The NPS is a market linked option where the pension received will be determined by the contributions made by the individual. It is designed for market efficiency and long-term capital growth, assuming that higher equity allocation and compounding over decades will generate a sufficient retirement corpus. The individual carries both the market risk as well as the longevity risk.The UPS is a hybrid model. It retains the defined contribution model of the NPS, but also guarantees a minimum pension that will be indexed to inflation and funded partly by returns from a dedicated pension guarantee fund.It’s a toss up for mid-career employees aged 35-50 years. They should stay with NPS if they have a higher risk appetite because even 15-20 years is long enough time to generate the magic compounding from equity-linked investments. But those seeking stable returns should opt for the UPS. It offers a cushion against future market volatility, especially if retirement is 10-15 years away.Those aged 50 and above should definitely opt for the UPS. At this stage, the corpus accumulation window is quite narrow. The guaranteed pension under UPS brings predictability, which is more important than chasing high but uncertain returns. Volatility at this stage can severely impact retirement income under NPS.Much depends on the returns generated by the market-linked component of both the NPS and the UPS in the coming years. Younger subscribers have an edge here because they can afford to take higher risk and stay in the NPS for better returns. On the flip side, their corpus can get dented badly if markets don’t live up to expectations..We used the NPS Trust calculator to know how things will work out for people at different ages. The calculations assume salaries will increase 2.5% a year and Dearness Allowance will increase 6% a year, the person will retire at 60 and live till the age of 80. The total aggregate benefit includes 60% of corpus withdrawn on superannuation and the monthly pension and dearness allowance received till death.A 25-year-old person who has just started working with a basic pay of Rs 25,000 stands to gain more if she stays in NPS. Even a blended return of 10% will yield more than what UPS offers. But if returns fall to 8-9%, UPS will be better.But at 10% returns, both options are neck to neck for a 35-year-old person who has put in 10 years, has a basic pay of Rs 35,000 and has accumulated Rs 12 lakh in retirement savings. Only if the return is more than 10% will NPS work out better.A 45-year-old person who has put in 20 years, has a basic pay of Rs 50,000 and has accumulated Rs 30 lakh in retirement savings will find the UPS better. Even a 12% return from NPS will not yield what UPS offers. At 8-10%, NPS will be ruinous.",NPS vs UPS: The answer depends on the age and risk profile of the individual.

"Who is Varun Mohan? Indian-origin CEO of Windsurf faces backlash after quitting startup for Google, derailing $3B OpenAI deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-varun-mohan-indian-origin-ceo-of-windsurf-faces-backlash-after-quitting-startup-for-google-derailing-3b-openai-deal/articleshow/122818109.cms,"Varun Mohan: Windsurf Co-founder with Indian roots

Co-founding Windsurf: Building an AI-native IDE



Fallout from the Google move

Backlash from investors and the public





Varun Mohan, a rising star in Silicon Valley and co-founder of AI startup Windsurf, is under fire after abruptly quitting to join Google ’s DeepMind, effectively tanking a $3 billion acquisition deal with OpenAI . The move triggered widespread criticism from investors, industry peers, and the public, with some branding Mohan a “generational villain” for leaving his team behind during a crucial transition. While Windsurf was later rescued in a last-minute deal by Cognition, the controversy has cast a long shadow over Mohan’s once-admired career. But who is the man at the center of this high-stakes tech saga?Varun Mohan was born and raised in Sunnyvale, California, to Indian immigrant parents. While the specific region in India remains undisclosed, his upbringing was defined by a blend of Indian cultural values and the American spirit of innovation. Encouraged to excel academically, Mohan showed an early aptitude for mathematics and computer science, regularly winning accolades in national Olympiads and competitions.Mohan’s academic journey led him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he pursued a rare dual-degree program.He completed a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). He specialized in areas like operating systems, machine learning, distributed computing, and algorithms, laying the groundwork for his future in AI infrastructure and developer tools.During his time at MIT, Mohan built his technical foundation with internships at major tech firms and research institutions, including Quora, LinkedIn, Samsung, Cloudera, and UC Santa Cruz. After graduating, he joined the self-driving startup Nuro, where he quickly rose to the role of Lead Software Engineer. These experiences gave him hands-on exposure to complex AI systems and real-world applications of machine learning.In 2021, Mohan co-founded Codeium, which was later rebranded as Windsurf, along with MIT classmate Douglas Chen. The company initially focused on GPU virtualization for deep learning but later pivoted to create Cascade, an AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE). The tool allowed developers to write, test, and refactor code with AI support, onboarding over a million users within just four months. Windsurf raised $243 million in funding and reached a $1.25 billion valuation, becoming one of the fastest-growing AI unicorns in the United States.In 2025, OpenAI was reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Windsurf for $3 billion. But just as the deal neared completion, Mohan and Chen resigned and licensed Windsurf’s technology to Google in a $2.4 billion agreement. Mohan then joined Google DeepMind, taking key team members with him. The sudden departure left Windsurf in crisis and eventually prompted a weekend-long rescue operation by AI firm Cognition. The move sparked outrage across the tech world.The fallout was swift and public. Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla criticized Mohan for abandoning his team, while Cognition CEO Scott Wu called the exit a betrayal of founder responsibility. On social media, users accused Mohan of prioritizing personal gain over team loyalty. One post read, “Founders cashing out while the team’s left behind isn’t just bad form. It’s long-term reputation damage.” Another user bluntly called him a “generational villain. ”Despite the backlash, Mohan’s contributions to AI-powered developer tools remain significant. He is widely regarded as a pioneer in agentic IDEs, which are tools that integrate AI into the entire coding process, and an influential figure in Silicon Valley’s AI evolution. Now at Google DeepMind, he continues to shape the future of AI-driven software development, although under the shadow of one of the year’s most controversial exits. Some say time will smooth over the headlines, especially if his next innovations speak louder than the noise. In tech, it’s never long before the next big move resets the narrative.","Varun Mohan, co-founder of AI startup Windsurf, quit to join Google DeepMind.

India at growing risk of gastric cancer: New WHO study projects 1.6 million cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/india-at-growing-risk-of-gastric-cancer-new-who-study-projects-1-6-million-cases/articleshow/122380231.cms,"India and China could see 6.5 million gastric cancer cases combined



Helicobacter pylori infection causes most gastric cancer cases in India



Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions



Early detection could prevent most gastric cancer cases



Younger populations in India face rising gastric cancer risk



Nationwide screening campaigns to detect and treat H. pylori early

Public education initiatives to raise awareness of gastric cancer symptoms, such as persistent indigestion, bloating, and unexplained weight loss

Strengthening diagnostic infrastructure, especially in rural areas where healthcare access is limited

Promoting healthy dietary and lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt-preserved foods, stopping tobacco use, and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

FAQs

Q: What did Stephen A. Smith say about Donald Trump's Redskins comment?

Q: Why did Donald Trump mention the Redskins name again in 2025?

Q: What does Stephen A. Smith believes is behind Donald Trump’s comment?

In a fiery moment on ESPN’s First Take, Stephen A. Smith didn't hold back in calling out U.S. President Donald Trump over his latest remarks on the Washington Commanders. Smith claimed that Trump’s push to revive the team’s controversial former name—the Redskins—is nothing more than a political distraction, aimed at shifting public attention away from far more serious issues, including the unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files.Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back when slamming President Donald Trump for reviving the Redskins name debate. Calling the move “petty” and “evasive,” Smith claimed it’s a deliberate distraction from more serious issues—namely, the unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files.""Well, I think it's the president being petty. I think it's him being evasive,"" Smith said, directly criticizing Trump’s attempt to tie federal stadium funding to the team changing its name back.Trump made headlines again in July 2025 when he suggested that he might block federal support for the Commanders’ proposed $2.7 billion stadium project unless the franchise reverts to its old name. That name was officially retired in 2020 after decades of protest from Indigenous groups and civil rights advocates. The team rebranded as the Commanders under new ownership in 2022.Though Trump framed his argument as standing up for tradition, Smith sees something much more calculated behind the president’s push.""Because when you look at the Redskins name, obviously it's something that needed to be changed,"" Smith said. ""And by him bringing that issue up, we all know from a political landscape, it's much ado about nothing... it's just him catering to his base to make sure that he serves, to appease them in some way to distract them from other issues, including the Epstein files.""The Commanders’ new stadium plans, centered around the RFK Stadium site, have received broad support from Congress and D.C. officials. President Biden had already signed legislation earlier this year to grant control of the land to the city. Yet Trump’s comments threaten to complicate that progress just as local leaders debate final budget allocations.For Smith, it’s not just about football. It’s about accountability—and, in his eyes, a president more focused on stoking culture wars than addressing unfinished business that demands transparency.Also Read: “I may put a restriction on them”: Donald Trump threatens to block $4 billion Commanders stadium plan Stephen A.

Yes, rules must be followed No, it's too harsh





Mumbai: Dubbing them ""a selfish lot"" who are not bothered about people's lives, Bombay HC has directed occupants of the top 18 floors of a 34-storey building in Tardeo which do not have an occupation certificate (OC) to vacate their flats in two weeks.A bench of Justices Girish Kulkarni and Arif Doctor said it is ""brazen illegality"" on the residents' part to occupy the flats in Willingdon Heights without an OC, and directed BMC to initiate appropriate action if the order is not complied with. It said ""affluent"" flat buyers ""who have taken the law into their own hands in occupying construction which has no OC are a selfish lot who not only with open eyes are acting contrary to the building regulations but also have the means to defeat legal action"" being taken by BMC.Slamming the residents for setting a ""very bad example"" to protect construction that has no OC, HC said they appear to be least bothered about their own lives. ""If this be so, how can they be bothered about anybody else in the event of any untoward incident taking place?"" it said, adding that such an approach, which is wholly contrary to the law, ""needs to be deprecated"". ""We clarify that such members would be entitled to reoccupy the tenements only after an OC is granted,"" it said on July 15.The order was uploaded on Saturday.The petition was filed by Sunil Jhaveri, a resident of the building, also known as Thakkar Tower, at Tulsiwadi, alleging gross illegalities. The building has no fire NOC and only a part OC for floors 1-16. BMC had flagged illegalities in the construction of floors 17-34, including amalgamation of the 26th and 27th floors. On March 27, HC had granted ad interim protection.Senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani, for Jhaveri, submitted notices issued by BMC from 2011, including over lack of a fire NOC and directing removal of unauthorised constructions. In Jan 2020, occupants of floors 17-34 were directed to vacate their flats in seven days. Jagtiani argued that while steps are being taken from floors 1-16 to regularise the violations, there can be no justification for persons to occupy floors 17-34 without an OC.Senior advocate S U Kamdar, for BMC, said the illegalities would be required to be restored in conformity with the original plans. There is no justification for the building's residents, particularly those on floors 17-34, to continue their occupation, he said, adding that the occupation of the entire building in the absence of a fire NOC is extremely dangerous.Senior advocate Dinyar Madon for the housing society urged HC to permit residents to continue occupation for some time on humanitarian grounds so that they can seek regularisation of illegalities and obtain an OC. To the judges' query, he said a year may be granted. The judges said if the proposition is accepted, ""we would render the entire statutory regime requiring strict compliance wholly nugatory and inconsequential"". ""This would amount to recognition of lawlessness, insofar as occupation of the buildings, with no occupation certificates are concerned,"" the bench said.Vacating the March 27 protection, the judges rejected Madon's request to stay the BMC order. They noted that the occupants were asked on several occasions to make alternative arrangements, which ""was emphatically made known to them"".

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has directed Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) to vacate a leased petrol pump site in Karimnagar and hand over possession of the land to the property owners. The land was leased to IOCL for 20 years for operation of a retail outlet, M/s. Mahendra Filling Station.The lease commenced on Sept 15, 2004, and expired on Aug 5, 2023.Prior to the expiry of the lease, IOCL, in Feb 2023, requested the landowners for a lease renewal for another 19 years and 11 months. However, the landowners, citing plans to divide property among their children, refused to renew lease and requested IOCL to vacate the premises. Disposing of the matter recently, Justice NV Shravan Kumar directed IOCL to hand over the property to the owners by Oct 5, 2025.According to the landowners, all siblings, they had leased out their land measuring 1333.33 square yards to IOCL for 20 years. In 2023, when IOCL asked owners for a lease renewal, the owners expressed their unwillingness to renew the lease agreement. However, IOCL again urged the owners to renew the lease, and in response, the owners requested IOCL to vacate premises.Meanwhile, when IOCL approached the civil court in Karimnagar for specific performance of the renewal clause of the lease, the landowners issued IOCL a legal notice informing them that the lease agreement was terminated by efflux of time and asked IOCL to vacate the premises.IOCL refused to vacate premises, claiming to be a 'statutory tenant', the owners' counsel claimed, while relying on previous HC orders in similar matters.","The land was leased to IOCL for 20 years for operation of a retail outlet.

KULLU: In the latest episode of devastation wreaked by extreme weather in Himachal Pradesh, at least two people were killed and hundreds of roads were blocked on Monday, cutting the supply of electricity to parts of the hill state and disrupting transport and utilities severely.Traffic flow was disrupted on the Chandigarh-Manali highway after torrential rains triggered flash floods at Banjar, Pandoh and Larji, leaving people stranded, cars marooned by floodwater, and timber rolling down the hills.Newlywed couple Rahul and Pallavi died when a landslide buried their house at Sutanh village of Chamba's Bharmour region at around 3.30am while they were asleep. More than 400 roads were blocked statewide, including key highways. Dozens of vehicles were stranded in floodwaters at Panarsa in Mandi, one of the worst-affected districts.In Mandi, 242 roads were shut, 294 transformers failed, an 49 water supply schemes were disrupted. Schools were ordered closed in Thunag subdivision and parts of Shimla.The Kullu district reported similar chaos, with 55 roads closed, 186 transformers down, and flash floods inundating areas like Gada Gushaini, where floodwaters brought down large quantities of timber.This follows a similar timber-laden flood in Garsa rivulet on July 1, which led to a state-ordered investigation.In Chamba, landslides in Churah and Bharmour cut off 25 roads and knocked out 19 power transformers. Schools remained closed in affected areas. National Highway 707 in Sirmaur was blocked by a landslide near Shillai, but reopened after three hours of clearance work.

Medical or political?

Rare exit mid-term

NEW DELHI: In a political twist few saw coming, Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned as the Vice-President of India on Monday evening, citing health reasons, sparking speculation across party lines. His resignation letter, addressed to President Droupadi Murmu, mentioned “prioritising health care” as the reason for stepping down, effective immediately.But Congress leader Jairam Ramesh isn’t buying the simple explanation.“The sudden resignation of the Vice-President and Chairman of the Rajya Sabha is as shocking as it is inexplicable,” Jairam Ramesh posted on X. “I was with him alongside a number of other MPs till around 5 pm today and had spoken to him over the phone at 7:30 pm. Clearly, there is far more to this totally unexpected resignation than meets the eye.”Jairam Ramesh added that Dhankhar “took both the government and the opposition to task in equal measure” and was scheduled to chair a Business Advisory Committee meeting and announce “major decisions related to the judiciary” on Tuesday. He urged Dhankhar to reconsider and called on Prime Minister Modi to intervene, saying, “This will be in the nation’s interest.”Dhankhar, 74, had recently undergone angioplasty at AIIMS Delhi. His resignation came just as the Monsoon session of Parliament kicked off, a timing that many, including Jairam Ramesh, find curious.As Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Dhankhar had several confrontations with the Opposition, which had even moved an unprecedented motion to impeach him, a first in independent India. That motion was later rejected.Interestingly, his exit comes just a day after an Opposition-backed notice to remove Justice Yashwant Varma was submitted in the Rajya Sabha, a move Dhankhar had acknowledged in the House, reportedly catching the government off-guard.Dhankhar now joins V V Giri and R Venkataraman as the only Vice-Presidents in India’s history to resign before completing their term, though both of his predecessors quit to contest the presidential election. Dhankhar’s resignation, by contrast, has no such political ladder in sight.In his letter, Dhankhar thanked President Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, the council of ministers, and MPs for their support. He reflected on India’s “unprecedented development” during his tenure, calling it “a true honour” to serve during what he described as a “transformative era.”","Dhankhar, 74, had recently undergone angioplasty at AIIMS Delhi.

While the company has not disclosed the number of laid off employees, but reports indicate this round of layoffs will affect of hundreds of employees across various locations. The move to reduce the workforce is part of the company’s restructuring efforts and is aimed at streamlining operations and adapting to evolving retail landscapes.As reported by Bloomberg, in a memo to employees, Cedric Clark, executive vice president of store operations at Walrmart US said that the company is removing market coordinator positions— the corporate role which assists market managers who oversee multiple stores. “We’re simplifying our market support structure, reducing touchpoints and friction for our store associates,” said Cedric Clark in the memo.The memo also emphasised that the job cuts are part of a shift towards simplifying the market support structure and “reduce touchpoints and friction for store associates”. Along with this, the retailer is also eliminating coach and coordinator roles at Walmart Academy , which is training division for the store managers and employees.The report also adds that the impacted employees will be offered store-level coach roles in their local areas.This move follows earlier restructuring steps, including the closure of Walmart’s North Carolina office and relocation of staff to hubs in Arkansas and California. In May, the company also announced 1,500 job cuts across its tech, e-commerce, and advertising divisions.The move is aimed towards streamlining its operations, according to an internal memo cited by Reuters.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power. Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, says he would study physics if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025.

What's next for Japan after far-right election surge?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/whats-next-for-japan-after-far-right-election-surge/articleshow/122826784.cms,"Shigeru Ishiba and his coalition need to cobble together a new majority to stay in power (Image: AP)

Japan's ruling coalition barely misses



Japan's right-wing surge







Japan's coalition government led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba lost its parliamentary majority in Sunday's election after large gains made by right-wing populist parties, in a sign that right-wing populism and polarization are now also undermining political stability in Japan.For now, Ishiba has vowed to hang on as prime minister, despite the second election debacle in nine months. His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost a snap election last October, making it a minority party ruling with a coalition.Ishiba has said he would ""humbly accept"" the result and ""continue to take responsibility for national affairs.""However, Ishiba's continuation as prime minister no longer depends on him alone. A strengthened opposition could topple him at any time with a vote of no confidence, even if these parties are not united enough to forge a governing coalition themselves.Ishiba also faces the threat of a rebellion within the LDP, which has governed Japan almost continuously for 70 years and has always controlled at least one chamber of parliament.Conservative LDP heavyweight Taro Aso has said he ""could not accept"" Ishiba as prime minister.However, potential successors appear to be staying under cover for the time being. ""Nobody wants to replace Ishiba in these difficult times for the LDP,"" political scientist Masahiro Iwasaki from Nihon University in Tokyo told DW.The ruling coalition of the LDP and the Buddhist Komei Party missed its self-imposed target of retaining a majority in the upper house of parliament, with 125 of 248 seats up for reelection. The coalition missed by only three seats, which was an unexpectedly close result.The LDP is now likely to try to win over some independent MPs to its side. Even if this succeeds, the government is still on shaky ground.One of Ishiba's options would be to expand his governing alliance. However, the major opposition parties have already declared that they would not enter into a grand coalition. Apparently, they doubt that Ishiba will remain prime minister and LDP leader in the medium term.This leaves the 68-year-old politician with the option of selective cooperation with individual opposition parties, which he has been doing since losing his majority in the more important lower house at the end of October.However, this will not succeed without painful concessions, for example, on tax issues. Before the election, Ishiba rejected opposition demands for a reduction in VAT on food. Instead, he promised every citizen a cash payment of 20,000 yen (€116/$135) by the end of the year to compensate for the loss of purchasing power due to high inflation.According to Japanese media, the LDP's election debacle comes as many voters are dissatisfied with the three-year decline in real wages caused by high inflation, along with a sharp increase in foreign workers and tourists.Two young, right-wing populist parties benefited the most from this, but the largest opposition group, the constitutional democratic party of former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, hardly benefited at all.The Sanseito party, which is only five years old, increased its number of seats in the upper house from two to 14 and the Democratic Party for the People from nine to 17.The Sanseito party went into the election campaign with the openly xenophobic slogan ""Japanese First"" and has accused the government of pursuing a ""policy of concealed immigration.""The number of foreign residents in Japan grew by 10% in 2024 to just under 4 million. The Sanseito Party claims that recruiting foreigners as workers to address an ageing and shrinking population will disrupt Japan's social harmony.Founder Sohei Kamiya has said his party has been modeled after Germany's far-right alternative for Germany (AfD) party, and other European far-right parties.The democratic party for the People, with its charismatic leader Yuichiro Tamaki, is now the third strongest force in the party system, which lends political weight to its main demand for tax cuts.""Both right-wing parties were able to capitalize on the anger of the younger generations towards the political system,"" analyst Tobias Harris told DW, citing percieved gerontocracy, inflation and stagnant wages as key factors.","Japan's coalition government led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba lost its parliamentary majority in Sunday's election.

Tariffs suit Trump's 'America First' vision

Trump sees tariffs as more flexible, easier to deploy

Trump blurs the line between tariffs and sanctions



Russian energy buyers face secondary sanctions





US President Donald Trump's reliance on tariffs rather than sanctions has been described as both the ""world's worst bet"" and ""a powerful proven source of leverage"" to protect the national interests of the United States.While tariffs essentially are taxes on imports to protect domestic industries, sanctions are penalties imposed on other countries to punish or influence their governments. Sanctions typically put restrictions on trade or finance.S ince his return to the White House in January, Trump's tariff threats against dozens of countries have created great uncertainty among US businesses and global trading partners.What's become known as ""tariff tango"" — bold pledges of steep duties on foreign goods, followed by abrupt reversals — suits Trump's shifting political or economic goals. Yet, financial markets remain on edge, not knowing how or when the president may deploy tariffs next.The tariff on China, the biggest economic and military rival to the US, reached historic highs in April, soaring to 145per cent before being significantly cut the following month after trade talks in London.Trump's sudden increase and later rollback of tariffs show how he uses them as a flexible way to fix what he sees as unfair trade, based on past trade disputes.""What shapes the president's views is the rapid rise of Japan in the 1980s, and the feeling that the Japanese were out-competing the iconic American car industry because the US has been too generous in its trade terms,"" Jennifer Burns, associate professor of history at Stanford University, told DW.Tariffs are Trump's preferred weapon to tackle the massive US trade deficit, particularly with China, which amounted to $295 billion (€253 billion) in 2024, according to the US Census Bureau. They also align with his ""America First"" agenda to protect domestic industries and boost US job creation.The White House has defended the president's approach, insisting that tariffs can be quickly deployed and, unlike sanctions, don't completely shut foreign markets to US firms.""[Trump] can add this pressure when he wants and then bring it back when markets start to freak out or it stops serving his purpose,"" Sophia Busch, associate director of the Geoeconomic Centre at the Atlantic Council think tank, told DW. ""This is much easier with tariffs than with sanctions.""Although tariffs have been widely criticized for their potential to stoke inflation, they do raise revenue for the US Treasury, unlike sanctions. US tariff revenues are up 110per cent to $97.3 billion in the first half of the year, compared to the same period last year. Tariffs are expected to raise $360 billion next year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.Tariffs give Trump direct, unilateral control, using executive orders without needing approval from the US Congress. Sanctions, on the other hand, often require complex legal frameworks and cooperation with international partners, like the European Union.The preference for tariffs over sanctions reflects Trump’s aim for rapid, visible economic leverage, but raises concerns about the destabilizing effects of such policies on global trade and peace.""The reason [tariffs] have such a bad reputation is because they're linked to these episodes of de-globalization, and in the 20th century, they were linked to armed conflict,"" said Burns. ""If low tariffs and open markets knit countries together in a way that forestalls armed conflict, does it mean that we might be moving away from that?""""Sanctions are more about punishing countries for violating international norms,"" Stanford's Jennifer Burns told DW. ""They're in response to specific actions, and if those actions cease, the sanctions can be undone.""Trump's second-term policies suggest he is using tariffs to achieve objectives typically associated with sanctions, such as pressuring countries like Canada, Mexico and China on nontrade issues like immigration and drug trafficking. These tariffs have prompted retaliatory measures or threats, which have intensified global trade tensions.Similarly, Colombia was threatened with tariffs after it rejected US deportation flights, while threatened levies on the European Union were partly announced as a response to EU privacy and climate regulations.Earlier this month, Trump threatened to impose a 50per cent tariff on imports from Brazil, which were framed as retaliation for the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a close ally. The far-right politician faces trial for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss, including plans to assassinate political rivals.Noting how the uncertainty around Trump's tariff policy had left US firms and global trade partners reeling, Burns warned that ""years of tariff uncertainty"" may cause a ""serious economic slowdown, as businesses and investors wait for a more predictable landscape.""Previous US administrations have preferred sanctions over tariffs as a punitive tool to bring rogue countries into line.Since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US has imposed more than 2,500 sanctions on Russia, targeting individuals, entities, shipping and aircraft. The US has also imposed sanctions on Venezuela, Iran and North Korea.""These economies are not crucial trading partners for the US,"" the Atlantic Council's Busch said, adding that Trump's tariffs on the ""top US trading partners"" were ""more of an economic threat domestically.""Trump has recently expressed more openness to deploying sanctions. Referring to a bill proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham for additional penalties on Moscow if it fails to negotiate a peace deal in good faith with Kyiv, Trump said he was ""very strongly"" considering fresh sanctions.If passed, the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 will target key Russian officials and oligarchs, financial institutions and the energy sector, aiming to curb Russia's ability to export oil and gas.The bill, which has bipartisan support, also proposes secondary sanctions on third countries and foreign companies, which Trump has termed ""secondary tariffs"" of up to 500per cent on countries importing Russian energy.Trump's similar ""secondary tariffs"" of 25per cent on buyers of Venezuelan oil, which took effect in March, were also designed to pressure energy importers to align with US foreign policy, a role typically reserved for sanctions.Secondary sanctions usually include blacklisting individuals and entities, asset freezes and banking restrictions. The threat of US criminal charges and travel bans is also often used.","US President Donald Trump's reliance on tariffs rather than sanctions has been described as both the ""world's worst bet"" and ""a powerful proven source of leverage"" While tariffs are taxes on imports to protect domestic industries, sanctions are penalties imposed on other countries to punish or influence their governments.

Dimon added that at that time Bezos was looking for a president for his e-commerce platform — Amazon.Dimon light-heartedly joked about the lifestyle change, envisioning a life where he'd ""never wear a suit again"" and ""live on a houseboat,"" but admitted that uprooting his young family and abandoning his career in finance felt like ""just a bridge too far.""Despite their friendship, Dimon declined the offer. The seasoned banker had valid reasons for his hesitation. In late 2000, Amazon's market capitalisation was a mere $5 billion, a stark contrast to its current valuation as a $2.4 trillion.After returning home, Dimon started seriously working on his next move and he fielded offers from global investment banks, insurance agent AGI via a call from Hank Greenberg and event Home Depot, whose founders pitched him despite Dimon admitting he’d never stepped inside one of their stores.But the call that stuck came from a headhunter representing Bank One. It was a Chicago-based lender and was struggling to build business. Despite a warning from analysts Mike Mayo that “even Hercules couldn’t fix it,” Dimon saw an opportunity to rebuild. Dimon invested $60 million which was half of his net worth into One Bank stock on day one vowing to “go down with the ship or up with the ship.”His decision to stay in banking led to his eventual rise as CEO of JPMorgan Chase.Jamie Dimon also shared his investment mantra. He says, “Don’t blow up.” With this principle in mind he guided JPMorgan’s risk culture. In another interview, Dimon talked about buying his first stock at age 14 in 1972—only to watch the market plunge 45% within two years. That early lesson, he said, taught him to “always factor the invisible risks.”","JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon shared an interesting anecdote from late 1999. Dimon revealed that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos offered him a job at Amazon. However, ultimately Dimon decided to not accept the offer, citing the significant personal and professional shift it would have entailed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122826751,imgsize-25052,width-400,resizemode-4/Jamie-Dimon.jpg"
