ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

SRIHARIKOTA: India’s heavy-lift rocket LVM3 on Wednesday successfully placed the US communications satellite- BlueBird Block-2 - into low Earth orbit, in an early morning launch mission. At 6100kg, it was the heaviest payload lifted by the rocket which completed its sixth operational flight and third dedicated commercial mission. Isro chairman V Narayanan said LVM3 rocket achieved an orbit of 518.5km against the planned 520km orbit.""This is the heaviest satellite to be launched by an Indian launcher in Indian soil. This is also the first back to back LVM3 launch missions within a period of 52days. With this, Isro has placed 434 satellites for 34 countries.""The 43.5m tall and 640tonne rocket lifted off from the Second Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. About 16 minutes after liftoff, BlueBird Block-2 was injected into a circular orbit at an altitude of around 520km with an inclination of 53degrees.The mission, designated LVM3-M6, was undertaken as part of a commercial agreement between NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), the commercial arm of Isro, and US-based AST & Science LLC.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a global low Earth orbit constellation aimed at enabling direct-to-mobile satellite connectivity.According to mission details, the satellite features a 223 square metre phased-array antenna, making it the largest commercial communications satellite deployed in low Earth orbit. The constellation is designed to support 4G and 5G voice and video calls, video streaming, text messaging and data services directly on standard mobile phones, without the need for specialised ground equipment.","US communications satellite- BlueBird Block-2 - placed into low Earth orbit.

NEW DELHI: After a brief breather earlier this week, Delhi’s air quality deteriorated again on Friday, slipping into the ‘very poor’ category, with transport emissions and pollution drifting in from neighbouring NCR districts continuing to weigh on the capital’s air.The city’s average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 292 at 8am, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, placing Delhi firmly in the ‘very poor’ bracket and reversing the marginal improvement seen over the past two days.Of the 39 air quality monitoring stations across the city, 22 recorded AQI levels above 300, indicating 'very poor' air. Anand Vihar (377), Jahangirpuri (372), Bawana (363) and Ashok Vihar (333) were among the worst-hit locations, while the remaining stations reported air quality in the 'poor' to 'moderate' range.Under CPCB classification, an AQI between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’, while readings above 401 fall in the ‘severe’ category.Data from the Decision Support System (DSS) for Air Quality Management showed vehicular emissions remained the single largest contributor to Delhi’s pollution load, accounting for 18.5%, followed by industrial emissions from Delhi and surrounding areas (9.5%), construction activity (2.5%) and waste burning (1.6%).Among NCR districts, Jhajjar in Haryana emerged as the biggest external contributor to Delhi’s pollution, accounting for 17.6%, followed by Rohtak (5.9%) and Sonipat (3.1%).The air quality is likely to deteriorate to the very poor category in the coming days, according to the forecast.Meteorological conditions offered limited relief. The predominant northwesterly winds remained weak, with speeds of up to 10 kmph during afternoon hours, restricting dispersion of pollutants, the Air Quality Early Warning System said.On the weather front, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 22.6°C, nearly 2 degrees above normal, while the minimum settled at 6.5°C, slightly below average, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Moderate fog is expected during early morning hours.This month has witnessed four poor air days and no satisfactory ones. This Tuesday was the latest severe air day when the index was at 412. Last December had eight poor and satisfactory days each.","The city’s average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 292 at 8am, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport while working globally. In a viral post on X, Kushwaha described how visa rules and paperwork often disrupt his travel plansAfter a recent trip to Berlin, Kushwaha said he was unable to travel to Ireland to surprise his best friend on his birthday because there was not enough time to apply for another visa. What should have been a simple decision, booking a flight, instead turned into hours spent navigating visa websites. The episode, he wrote, showed how routine travel can become unnecessarily complicated.In his post, Kushwaha described standing in long airport queues while other travellers passed through quickly. He said he often carries folders of documents he has already submitted many times. Schengen visa applications, he added, feel like a full-time job. They require bank statements, cover letters and detailed explanations for ordinary trips.“I’m not angry. I’m tired,” he wrote. Kushwaha stressed that his frustration is practical rather than emotional.He said national pride does not reduce the mental effort needed to deal with constant paperwork.The post also pointed to wider questions about passport strength. India ranks low on global mobility indexes and offers visa-free access to relatively few destinations. Kushwaha argued that these rankings translate into real constraints for professionals who travel frequently for work, conferences and collaboration.Many replies to his post shared similar experiences. Users posted stories of delayed appointments, short visa validity periods and uncertainty even for repeat travellers with established international careers.Kushwaha also touched on issues beyond travel. He said investments made in India had lost value over time because of the rupee’s decline. He also mentioned air pollution and outdated banking and KYC processes as factors that add to everyday friction.","Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality improved for the second consecutive day on Thursday, though pollution levels continued to remain a concern.The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 234 at 4 pm, placing it in the ‘poor’ category, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The reading marked an improvement from an AQI of 271 recorded at the same time on Wednesday and a sharp recovery from the ‘severe’ level of 412 recorded on Tuesday.Of the 40 functional air quality monitoring stations in the capital, 10 reported ‘moderate’ air quality with AQI levels below 200. These included Lodhi Road, IIT Delhi, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Aya Nagar. Meanwhile, 27 stations continued to record air quality in the ‘poor’ category.Two stations — Jahangirpuri and Bawana — recorded ‘very poor’ air quality, with AQI levels crossing 300.Despite the recent improvement, forecasts indicate that air quality is likely to deteriorate to the ‘very poor’ category in the coming days.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 to 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 to 200 ‘moderate’, 201 to 300 ‘poor’, 301 to 400 ‘very poor’ and 401 to 500 ‘severe’.Data from the Decision Support System (DSS) for Air Quality Management showed that vehicular emissions were the largest contributor to Delhi’s pollution load on Wednesday, accounting for 18.5 per cent.

PM Modi Flags Off Two Highways To Curb Congestion In Delhi-NCR

NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Wednesday slapped an ""intention to termination notice"" - the final procedure before termination - on Roadways Solutions India Infra Ltd (RSIL) for failing to meet the construction target of a 35-km stretch of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. The physical and financial progress on this stretch in Gujarat was barely 4.9% and 4.6%, respectively, of the target.The progress on two other stretches - 27 km and 25 km - being constructed by the company in the state is at 23% and 36%. The dismal pace of construction may push the revised deadline of the project beyond March 2028, sources said.Pune-based RSIL is an engineering and construction company that operates mainly in the roads and highways sector. The company had bagged the packages of the expressway in Gujarat in 2021.Suprisingly, NHAI had terminated the contract of RSIL for two stretches in March 2023 and then re-awarded them to RSIL in Nov 2023 after it again put in the lowest bid. TOI on Feb 14 had first reported how the slow progress on these three stretches, with a total length of 87 km in Gujarat, was delaying the over Rs 1 lakh crore project.In a letter to RSIL, NHAI said the ""intention to termination notice"" has been issued on account of contractor's ""absolute and continued non-performance"".It said, ""...despite the contractor having been granted repeated indulgences and more than adequate opportunities through the execution of three settlement agreements, the contractor has achieved a negligible financial progress of only 4.59% (after lapse of 16 months from the appointed date of Aug 31, 2024)"".The letter said that as per the originally envisaged timeline of 18 months commencing from Aug 31, 2024, the contractor ought to have achieved approximately 70% financial progress. Mentioning how little progress has been made even after 16 months conclusively establishes that completion of the Jujuwa-Gandeva section of the expressway by Nov 15, 2026 ""is wholly impossible"", it said.The highways authority claimed that despite granting repeated opportunities and its extended assistance to the contractor, it ""failed to demonstrate any improvement or to achieve the requisite progress"". It said that even after three settlement agreements, the contractor failed to meet targets. ""In the settlement agreements, it was specified that if it fails to achieve agreed milestones, NHAI will terminate the contract without any cure period notice. So, we have served the notice,"" said an official.Cure period notice is issued to a contractor to fix any breach in 60 days. NHAI said the communication may be treated as a ""15-day notice"", as per the contract agreement, and after the expiry of this period, the authority ""shall be entitled to terminate the contract agreement"". It has also said the incomplete three packages under RSIL are creating significant public inconvenience across multiple fronts. In the case of two other sections, NHAI is likely to give a cure period notice to RSIL.","Pune-based RSIL is an engineering and construction company that operates mainly in the roads and highways sector.

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4, which is designed to hit targets 3,500-km away, from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.There was no official word from the defence ministry on the missile test conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat, which is operated by the tri-service strategic forces command.Sources, however, confirmed the missile was the solid-fuelled K-4, which can carry a two-tonne nuclear payload and is critical for India to strengthen the sea leg of its nuclear weapons triad.""A comprehensive analysis will determine whether Tuesday's test actually met all laid down technical parameters and mission objectives or revealed some shortcomings. It usually takes several tests for ballistic missiles, especially those launched from submarines, to achieve full operational status,"" a source said.After multiple trials from undersea platforms in the shape of submersible pontoons over the last several years, the two-stage K-4 missile was tested for the first time from INS Arighaat in Nov last year.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29 last year.Her forerunner INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018, can carry only the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India will commission its third SSBN as INS Aridhaman in the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth in 2027-28 under the secretive over Rs 90,000 crore ATV (advanced technology vessel) programme launched decades ago. These two SSBNs are slightly larger, with a displacement of 7,000 tonnes each, than the first two 6,000-tonne ones.There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones on the first four submarines.India's existing SSBNs, of course, are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. The operational deployment of K-4 missiles, which will be followed by the K-5 and K-6 missiles in the 5,000 to 6,000-km range class, will somewhat help India narrow the huge gap with countries like the US, Russia and China, which have a range of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).The first two legs of India's nuclear triad are much more robust, with the land-based ballistic missiles led by the Agni-5 with a strike range of over 5,000 km and fighters like Rafales, Sukhoi-30MKIs and Mirage-2000s capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs.The SSBNs, however, impart India's deterrence posture with much more credibility because they are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory strikes in line with the country's ""no first-use"" policy.","India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4 from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday ordered states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, a major move amid public outcry over the ""new definition"" of the mountain range.The Union environment ministry said the decision was aimed at the ""conservation and protection"" of one of the world’s oldest mountain systems, covering the stretch from Delhi to Gujarat. The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region and to put an end to unregulated mining across the region.As part of the announcement, the ministry instructed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify further zones across the Aravallis where mining must be prohibited, beyond those areas already notified by the Centre-based on ecological, geological and landscape-level assessments.The Centre also said it intends to expand the list of areas protected and restricted from mining across the range. For mines that are currently operational, state governments have been asked to ensure ""strict compliance"" with environmental safeguards and adherence to Supreme Court orders.On Monday, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said at a press conference that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Responding to the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of the Aravallis, he said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He further underlined the government’s efforts such as the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and global recognition of India’s forest cover, adding that the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".The Supreme Court's acceptance, classifying any landform in Aravalli districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief as Aravali Hills-sparked concern among several stakeholders, who fear the new definition could leave more than 90% of the range open to mining, as most landforms fall below the 100-metre threshold.","The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region.

NEW DELHI: In a crackdown on the functioning of a dummy school that enrolled hundreds of students in higher secondary classes, the Delhi high court on Wednesday barred it from running classes XI and XII or admitting new students.High court also initiated contempt of court proceedings against the owner and management of Richmondd Global School for flouting its earlier undertaking given to the court in this regard.Justice Jyoti Singh ordered the management to deposit Rs 75 lakh with the court registry as the money was charged from hundreds of students in these classes who, the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) found, never turned up to attend classes but were enrolled only on paper.CBSE had carried out a surprise inspection, suspecting the students were taking coaching classes but paid the school to remain eligible to sit for the class XII examination and become eligible for quotas in Delhi's engineering and medical colleges.Justice Singh, while penalising the school, allowed 128 students out of 1,300 enrolled in classes XI and XII to be transferred to a nearby CBSE-affiliated school, and asked the board to open its online portal so they could apply for examination registration.""A team of CBSE officials shall visit the school on December 26 at 2.30 pm, inspect the records and verify the admissions as also the attendance of 128 students studying in class XII.

LUCKNOW: Mounting yet another scathing attack on Congress, PM Narendra Modi Thursday accused past govts of glorifying one family while neglecting contributions of other national icons, and practising political untouchability. BJP govt freed the country from the “tendency” to attribute every achievement to just one (Nehru-Gandhi) family, he said.Speaking after inaugurating Rashtra Prerna Sthal, a memorial dedicated to Jan Sangh stalwarts, on the 101st birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Lucknow, Modi also said, “BJP is proud that our govt had the opportunity to tear down the wall of Article 370”.He said the legacy of good governance created by BJP-led NDA govt was now being taken to new heights at both central and state levels.“After Independence, a tendency emerged to associate all the good work that took place in India to the same family. Be it books, govt schemes, institutions, streets, roads or squares, it was all connected to the pride of one family... “...Our govt, serving Mother India, is giving respect to her every child, to everyone’s contribution.” he said.Rashtra Prerna Sthal houses 65-ft tall statues of Vajpayee, Syama Prasad Mookherjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.Constructed at a cost of Rs 230 crore, the memorial sprawling over 65 acres also houses a lotus-shaped museum depicting the life and journey of the stalwarts.Reiterating BJP’s sharp narrative contrasting dynastic politics with merit based recognition, the PM asserted his govt was honouring national icons who were ignored earlier across party lines.BJP did not let the legacy of B R Ambedkar be undermined, he said, referring to the ‘panchteerth’ associated with the Dalit icon. He accused Congress of attempting to dismantle Ambedkar’s legacy.","PM Narendra Modi accused past govts of glorifying one family while neglecting contributions of other national icons.

LUCKNOW: Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered on Thursday a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Maulana Shamsul Huda Khan, a govt-recognised madrassa teacher from Azamgarh who fraudulently drew salary and retirement benefits for a decade while living abroad, acquiring British citizenship, and allegedly nurturing links with Pakistan-based religious networks.ED sources said Huda amassed properties worth Rs 33 crore and cash worth Rs 5 crore from suspicious entities.

MUMBAI: Marking a long-awaited milestone for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) formally entered India's commercial aviation map on Thursday with the arrival and departure of its first scheduled passenger flights.The inaugural arrival was IndiGo flight 6E460 from Bengaluru, which touched down at 8am and was welcomed with a ceremonial water cannon salute. Over half an hour later, NMIA saw its first departure - an IndiGo flight to Hyderabad - taking off at 8.40 am. Day 1 saw 48 flights connecting nine domestic destinations and serving over 4,000 passengers, with peak traffic between 5 pm and 7 pm.NMIA's take-off marks a major expansion of air connectivity for Mumbai region, constrained for decades by existing airport operating out of a single runway and handling 950 flights every 24 hours.The 'Navi' or 'newness' factor was underscored even by aviation professionals. ""For us, the new airport is called Navi,"" said an airline pilot. It is the official call sign to be used by pilots and air traffic controllers in radio communication. ""When the first flight was handed over to the Navi Mumbai tower, we radioed to the pilots, 'Welcome to Navi',"" an aviation official said.There were teething troubles for flyers. Several passengers said road signages were unclear or missing at junctions, causing motorists to reach the cargo terminal before finding the passenger terminal.Approach roads were also under repair, with JCBs deployed for road-widening work.Despite Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport launching bus services on five routes, most flyers opted for app cabs as auto and taxi stands were not fully operational. Passengers travelling from areas such as Matunga and Dadar noted the distance to the new airport-around 35 km. ""Signages are not clearly visible on Atal Setu when you enter Navi Mumbai,"" said Matunga resident Dinesh Gandhi.Curious visitors also turned up to see the airport, but private security restricted entry to ticketed passengers.Day 1 operations began with four carriers: IndiGo, Akasa Air, Air India Express and Star Air. Developed and operated by Adani Airports Holdings Limited, NMIA is among India's largest greenfield airport projects. Chairman Gautam Adani welcomed passengers from the inaugural flight and interacted with staff and frontline workers. ""It's a proud day for Mumbai and for India,"" he said.Cultural performances featuring Maharashtrian lezim, dhol and tutari added local flavour.

Prayers And Peace: PM Modi Joins Christmas Service, Shares Message Of Harmony And Unity

PM’s outreach part of continuous efforts to engage with minorities

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday joined a large congregation of Christians at a Christmas service at the Cathedral Church of the Redemption here, as he continued with his outreach to the minority community. ""The service reflected the timeless message of love, peace and compassion. May the spirit of Christmas inspire harmony and goodwill in our society,"" he said.As part of the governing BJP's concerted efforts to strengthen its connect with Christians, party president JP Nadda participated in celebrations at the Christian Higher Secondary School, organised by the Mao Naga Christian Fellowship Delhi (MNCFD), and dwelt at the govt's focus on development in the northeast, a region with significant population of the community.As part of his engagement with Christians, Modi had addressed a Christmas celebration organised by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India in 2024, attended an Easter event at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in 2023, and hosted a programme at his residence to mark Christmas the same year.Opposition was, however, quick to target him for incidents of vandalism and harassment aimed at Christians in some parts of the country.Congress posted on X a video purportedly showing members of right-wing outfits vandalising Christmas decorations in Raipur in BJP-governed Chhattisgarh, alleging it exposed the true face of BJP.BJP’s efforts to reach out to Christians over the last few years have met with limited success as a section of the community continues to harbour distrust due to the Sangh Parivar’s antipathy to conversion, which has led to the enactment of stringent laws in several states as the party’s influence surged since 2014.In terms of absolute numbers, Kerala has the highest Christian population in the country, and the state will be heading to assembly polls in a few months along with Tamil Nadu, which has the second highest population of the community.Their numbers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu are over 18% and 6% respectively, according to the 2011 census.With over 25%, Christians are a significant presence in Goa, but they wield maximum political influence in the northeast due to their dominant majority status in Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya.","PM Narendra Modi attends Christmas morning service at the Cathedral Church of the Redemption in Delhi.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

Taylor Swift opens up about Scott Swift’s surgery while dating Travis Kelce and using her wealth for good



Taylor Swift did something deeply personal, and very powerful. The global pop star donated $1 million to the American Heart Association to honor her father, Scott Swift, after his serious heart surgery earlier this year. On Tuesday, Dec. 23, PEOPLE exclusively confirmed the donation. The gift comes after Scott Swift, 73, went through a quintuple bypass surgery, a major heart operation that doctors say can save lives. Taylor Swift’s donation will help fund heart research, better treatment, and life-saving care for people across the United States. According to a press release, the 36-year-old singer’s support will help expand access to care and improve prevention efforts for heart disease. It is a cause that now hits very close to home for her.“Taylor Swift’s remarkable generosity will create lasting change far beyond its financial value,” said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer of the American Heart Association, in a statement. Taylor’s decision also comes during a busy time in her life. She is one of the richest artists in the world, with an estimated net worth of aboutaccording to Forbes, and she is also in a high-profile relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . Even with fame, wealth, and global success, this moment shows a more personal side of Taylor, a daughter standing by her dad.In July, PEOPLE confirmed that Scott Swift had undergone quintuple bypass surgery just over a month earlier and was recovering well. TMZ first reported the surgery.Scott went in for a regular check-up when doctors noticed something unusual. The surgery was not caused by a heart attack. According to the Mayo Clinic, coronary bypass surgery helps blood flow around blocked arteries in the heart.Taylor Swift, her brother Austin Swift, 33, and her mother Andrea Swift, who has been married to Scott for 37 years, stayed with him throughout the surgery and recovery. During Taylor Swift’s first appearance on Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast in August, she spoke about the experience.“It was really intense,” Taylor said. “It all happened really quick.”She shared that her dad always had a “perfect EKG,” but a stress test showed five blockages. Taylor moved in with him during the summer and helped care for him.“My brother and my mom and I were each taking shifts in the ICU and staying with him 24/7,” she said, calling the experience “surreal.” Nancy Brown also highlighted Taylor’s emotional impact beyond money.“Her family’s experience with cardiovascular disease is all too common, affecting nearly half of American adults,” Brown said.“Her commitment to supporting her father will make so many others aware of the need to take their own heart health seriously.”Known for her famous “heart hands,” Taylor Swift is now using that symbol, and her massive platform, to bring real change.Also Read: Is Taylor Swift Pregnant?

U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

What is the $100,000 H-1B fee?

What is changing in the H-1B selection system?

Why was the lottery system changed?

H-1B visa burden

Clampdown may hit Indian IT firms?

What can be the impact on Indian professionals?

NEW DELHI: After US President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 entry fee on new H-1B visa applications, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a major overhaul of the visa selection process replacing the long-standing random lottery system with a new wage-weighted selection model.In a statement on Tuesday, the department said it is amending rules governing the H-1B visa programme to ""implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid"" applicants, with the stated aim of protecting the wages, working conditions and job opportunities of American workers.The new guidance comes amid an intensifying crackdown by the Trump administration on immigration, both legal and illegal including the H-1B programme, which US companies rely on to hire foreign talent. Indian professionals form one of the largest groups of H-1B visa holders in the United States.The H-1B programme allows US employers especially technology firms to hire foreign workers in specialised fields. Visas are typically valid for three to six years.Until now, total H-1B fees generally ranged between $2,000 and $5,000. Under Trump’s order, the fee for new H-1B applications would jump to $100,000, dramatically raising hiring costs for employers.Under the current system, H-1B visas are allocated through a random lottery after electronic registrations, as demand far exceeds the annual quota of 85,000 visas (65,000 regular cap plus 20,000 for advanced degree holders).That system will now change.Under the new rule, H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance. Instead, registrations will be weighted based on wage levels set by the US Department of Labour (DOL). Applicants offered higher salaries will have a better chance of selection.The new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from February 27, 2026, ahead of the FY 2027 H-1B cap registration season. H-1B e-registrations typically open in March.US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said the existing lottery system was prone to abuse. USCIS said the random lottery allowed some employers to flood the system with lower-wage applications, hurting American workers.""The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by US employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,"" USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said, PTI reported.""The new weighted selection will better serve Congress' intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America's competitiveness by incentivising American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers,"" he added.USCIS said the reform is part of a broader effort to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B programme and aligns with other changes, including Trump’s proclamation imposing an additional $100,000 per visa.""As part of the Trump Administration's commitment to H-1B reform, we will continue to demand more from both employers and aliens so as not to undercut American workers and to put America first,"" Tragesser added.Trump’s renewed crackdown on immigration and H-1B visas is expected to impact Indian IT majors, particularly Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys, according to an analysis.A Bloomberg News study said the impact would be especially sharp for international staffing firms that act as intermediaries for US companies seeking H-1B talent. These include Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys Ltd. and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.This year, Amazon emerged as the largest recipient, with over 10,000 visas approved, followed by TCS, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California continues to host the highest number of H-1B workers.Indian nationals form the largest group of H-1B visa holders. In the fiscal year ending September 2024, 80,449 of the 1.41 lakh H-1B approvals (57%) were for Indian beneficiaries, according to USCIS.However, analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) suggests the new system will heavily favour senior professionals. The probability of selection would rise 107% for Level IV wage earners, but fall 48% for Level I workers.This means entry-level professionals and recent international graduates from US universities with many of them Indians, could face steep barriers.From December 15, the US State Department began enhanced screening and vetting of H-1B and dependent H-4 visa applicants, including checks of their social media profiles.The tighter scrutiny has also led to several H-1B visa interviews across India being postponed and pushed back by months, leaving many applicants who travelled to India for visa stamping stranded.While the administration argues the new system will curb abuse and protect American workers, the combined effect of higher fees, wage-based selection and tighter vetting is likely to reshape the H-1B landscape, making it tougher for younger professionals to enter the US workforce and potentially pushing more work offshore.Supporters of the H-1B programme argue it is crucial for hiring healthcare professionals and educators, drives innovation, and supports economic growth in the US by filling specialised roles. Critics, however, claim the visas are often used for entry-level roles rather than highly specialised positions. They argue that companies can suppress wages by classifying jobs at lower skill levels, even when the hired workers have significant experience.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a major overhaul of the visa selection process. H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance.

Rupee's fall triggers fund transfer: Rich Indians rush to park money overseas; banks roll out additional regulations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupees-fall-triggers-fund-transfer-rich-indians-rush-to-park-money-overseas-banks-roll-out-additional-regulations/articleshow/126170842.cms,"RBI Slashes Rates After Rupee Fall, Boosts Liquidity And Lifts India’s GDP Forecast To 7.3%

Rules for overseas fund transfers

More regulations

Problems with regulations

Many Indians looking to transfer money overseas are facing tightened scrutiny from high street banks, demanding to provide detailed proof behind the origin of the funds. This comes as rupee continues to slide against the US dollar and many rush to move their funds abroad.Over the past month, at least two Mumbai-headquartered private sector banks have asked high net worth individuals (HNIs), non-resident Indians (NRIs) and even a film production company to submit chartered accountant-certified testimonials validating the source of funds proposed to be remitted abroad, according to an ET report. In several instances, customers were also told that the certification must come from accountants empanelled with the bank, rather than a CA of their choice.These checks come even though the regulatory framework already lays out clear limits and conditions. Under the Reserve Bank of India’s liberalised remittance scheme (LRS), resident individuals can remit up to $250,000 annually for overseas investments, property purchases, travel and other permitted purposes, according to ET. NRIs are allowed to repatriate up to $1 million a year after selling assets or property in India.Separately, businesses are permitted to make outward remittances from current accounts to pay overseas vendors and service providers, such as a movie producer transferring funds to cover hotel stays and shooting expenses in foreign locations.“Under the RBI regulations, only own funds can be remitted under LRS,” Rajesh P Shah, partner at Jayantilal Thakkar & Co told ET.Restrictions are particularly tight when it comes to remittances from non-resident ordinary (NRO) accounts, where borrowed funds cannot be used.NRO accounts are rupee-denominated accounts maintained by NRIs to manage income earned in India. Besides interest on fixed deposits, rental income and dividends, proceeds from redeemed mutual funds and property sales in India are typically credited to these accounts.According to Pankaj Bhuta, founder of CA firm P R Bhuta & Co, recent enforcement action may be influencing banks’ approach. He pointed to a penalty imposed on a leading bank by an appellate tribunal, noting that authorised dealer banks cannot act only as middlemen for outward remittances and must carry out due diligence to ensure the transaction complies with FEMA rules.Under RBI rules, outward remittances from NRO balances must be sourced only from legitimate receivables in India and cannot come from borrowings or transfers from other NRO accounts. “So, an authorised dealer bank may feel obliged to verify the source of funds before processing such remittances. However, a peculiar challenge arises in cases involving a change in residential status from ‘resident’ to ‘non-resident’ upon emigration. Savings bank accounts [which are subsequently redesignated as NRO accounts] often contain balances accumulated over several years, making it difficult to precisely identify the source of funds. In certain instances, despite initially furnishing income tax returns, our clients have been additionally required to provide salary certificates dating back several years to establish that the funds originated from their own income,” Bhuta said.The situation is different for corporate remittances. While LRS and NRO-related transfers prohibit the use of borrowed money, businesses face no such restriction when paying overseas vendors. These payments do not have an upper limit and can be made from working capital, including bank borrowings, provided banks verify the authenticity of invoices raised by foreign suppliers. Even so, practitioners say banks questioning the source of funds in such cases is unusual. “But assessing fund sources in such cases is strange,” said another practitioner.For years, many wealthy Indians have been shifting a portion of their assets overseas, setting up companies and trusts, transferring money to NRI relatives, and spreading wealth across currencies and jurisdictions. This strategy is often driven by diversification goals and long-term planning for the next generation, many of whom settle abroad. With the rupee hitting new lows, the urge to remit more funds has only intensified.Against this backdrop, banks’ heightened caution is being felt most acutely now, as customers pushing more money overseas encounter growing compliance hurdles.Shah said that banks seem to be layering additional compliance requirements on top of what the rules already mandate.“Once a CA certifies the same, there should be no requirement to have an additional certificate asking for the sources of funds. But, bank compliance teams are asking for extra documents, adding to the paperwork for customers.""He further added that while bankers should do their due diligence, they should not ask for something which is unnecessary.""Over the last one month some banks are even insisting on certificates from the CAs listed with them,” he said.","Banks are demanding detailed proof behind the origin of the funds.

Lance Armstrong’s life today and recent updates

Lance Armstrong is a former American cyclist who once ruled the sport. He is also a cancer survivor, author, and public speaker. His story includes great success, a major fall, and a long road to rebuilding his life and finances after one of the biggest scandals in sports history.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Lance Armstrong’s net worth is estimated at $50 million. One of the primary reasons Armstrong remains wealthy today is his early investment in Uber. In 2009, he invested $100,000 through Chris Sacca’s venture capitalist fund.That investment later grew to an estimated $20 to $30 million, according to CNBC. Armstrong himself said in a 2018 CNBC interview that the Uber investment “saved” his family financially during hard years.Lance Armstrong was born on September 18, 1971, in Texas. He became a top athlete at a young age and turned professional in the early 1990s. In 1996, his career stopped when doctors found advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain.After months of treatment, Armstrong returned to cycling in 1998. From 1999 to 2005, he won the Tour de France seven times. At that time, he was one of the most famous athletes in the world.In 2012, the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) banned Armstrong for life after finding strong evidence of doping. He was stripped of all titles from 1998 onward. Major sponsors like Nike, Trek, and Oakley ended their deals.During the period of his greatest success, Armstrong’s total assets were more than $100 million. His fortune plummeted due to sponsors withdrawing, court cases, and settlements. Armstrong confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs in a talk with Oprah Winfrey in 2013, thereby verifying the investigations' results.Lance Armstrong has his primary residence in Texas and Colorado at present. His income comes from different sources, such as podcasts, speaking sessions, and business investments. Although he has severed ties with the Livestrong Foundation, the charity has raised more than $500 million in total support for cancer.In recent years, Armstrong has stayed out of major controversy and focuses on media work and family life. His financial position has remained stable, with no major new scandals reported by reliable US outlets.Also Read: “I don’t call everyone brothers”: Khabib Nurmagomedov and Zlatan Ibrahimovic share playful strength moment","Lance Armstrong is a former American cyclist who once ruled the sport.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

However, police have so far been unable to trace any such notice. Police initially suspected it may have been sent digitally, but no evidence supporting this claim was found on the accused’s phone.Balamurugan reportedly told police that he came to know about the alleged divorce notice through a friend who was also acquainted with Bhuvaneshwari.The friend has since been summoned, and his statement is being recorded. “At this stage, we are not certain whether any divorce notice was sent, as claimed by the accused. We have found that some data was deleted from his phone, which will be sent to forensic experts for recovery,” a senior police officer said.The officer added the accused’s house is yet to be searched for any incriminating material linked to the crime.Police further said Balamurugan, an MCA graduate who had quit his job at a private firm, confessed to having planned his wife’s murder well in advance. Police believe it had been in the making for nearly a year. As part of the alleged plan, he is said to have procured a pistol illegally much earlier and also purchased a knife as a backup option.After shifting to Cholourpalya, Balamurugan allegedly searched for Bhuvaneshwari and spotted her a few days before the incident. Police said he closely observed the route she regularly took while returning home from the bank.On Tuesday evening, he allegedly shot her from behind. After the first bullet struck her head and she collapsed, he reportedly fired two more rounds, hitting her head, back and left hand. While the accused claimed he procured the pistol and ammunition from Bihar, police said this is yet to be verified. Investigators are analysing his call detail records.Police found that Bhuvaneshwari had recently been promoted and transferred to the Basaveshwaranagar branch, and that the transfer was not at her request.Further investigation is under way.","Police are searching for an alleged divorce notice that the deceased, Bhuvaneshwari, was said to have sent to her husband, the accused Balamurugan.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Between 2022 and Nov 2025, as many as 9,450 people died by suicide in Bengaluru. This means every day, an average of seven people took their lives in the state capital. Hanging was the leading method of suicide, with 8,148 people choosing it.According to the data shared by home minister G Parameshwara, in response to a question by MLC K Govindaraj, 740 people died by consuming poison, which is the second leading method. Additionally, 204 people ended their lives by jumping from buildings and other high places.The data reflected a disturbing trend of an increase in deaths by suicide in the last few years. In 2022, Bengaluru registered 2,313 deaths by suicide, which increased to 2,370 the next year. In 2024, almost 2,403 suicide cases were reported in the city. In 2025, 2,364 cases of suicide were reported.According to Dr Raveesh BN, professor and head of the department of psychiatry at Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute, death by suicide is a self-directed injury due to intense emotional pain and a lack of problem-solving skills. ""It is a psycho-social problem,"" he said.""Access to means is also an issue in deaths by suicide. Earlier, fans were fitted at a height that can't be reached easily.Earlier, pesticides and other materials were not easily available, unlike now,"" he stated. He explained that when kerosene was easily available, self-immolation was one of the major causes of death by suicide.""Various forms of stress continue to be the major reason for suicides. If individuals don't learn problem-solving skills, they are more vulnerable to taking extreme steps,"" he warned.Dr Kiran R, senior resident at Tele MANAS, Nimhans, confirmed the increasing incidents of deaths by suicide. ""Family and relationship, academic, financial and adolescent issues are the major reasons for individuals taking such extreme steps,"" he said.""If one develops suicidal thoughts, they must call a helpline number immediately and seek professional help. They need to talk to close ones and move to a safer place immediately,"" he advised.According to Archana Kartik, project manager at Tele MANAS E-Health Research Centre IIIT-B, the centre gets calls from individuals aged 18 and above. ""Most of the phone calls received are from people between the ages of 18 and 45, due to issues like sleep, sadness, phobias, anxiety, marriage-related issues, financial difficulties, exam stress, grief, and suicidal ideation,"" she said. ""When needed, the audio calls can be converted to video consultation through mental health professionals,"" she added.","Hanging was the leading method of suicide, with 8,148 people choosing it. 740 people died by consuming poison, which is the second leading method. 204 people ended their lives by jumping from buildings and other high places.

How to fight cybercrime? Delhi special CP Devesh Chandra Srivastava will tell you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/how-to-fight-cybercrime-delhi-special-cp-devesh-chandra-srivastava-will-tell-you/articleshow/126182535.cms,"Delhi Police special commissioner (crime) Devesh Chandra Srivastava

NEW DELHI: Online predators are claiming new victims every day, reinventing their tactics to bypass every defence. Whether it is the lure of easy investment gains, the psychological warfare of 'digital arrest', blackmail or fake utility alerts, the reach of cybercrime seems unending.This year alone, Delhi has seen a staggering number of complaints, with scammers swindling residents of more than Rs 100 crore, much of it stolen from senior citizens who never saw the trap coming.Cybercriminals capitalise on the element of surprise, exploiting the fleeting moment of panic and disorientation that occurs when someone is blindsided by a threat. A common example is digital arrest, where fraudsters abruptly inform targets that their personal details are linked to serious investigations, like money laundering or terrorism. These tactics are effective because the immediate shock often paralyses a person's ability to think rationally, leading them to make poor decisions under pressure.Many people fall victim to simpler traps, such as handing over OTPs after being told their SIM card will be deactivated, an electricity or water bill is late, or a package is awaiting delivery. In these moments, they fail to stop and consider whether they actually have an unpaid balance, pending dues, or if they even ordered anything at all.Despite dedicated efforts from cyber investigators and ongoing public awareness campaigns from govts and financial institutions to curb this growing trend, digital fraud remains a persistent threat that drains the savings of hundreds of individuals daily.Data shows a sharp rise in both the number of cases and the amount of money lost by Delhiites to cybercrime in recent years. In 2023, the city recorded 1,347 cases, with losses totalling Rs 183.6 crore. The following year saw a significant spike, with 1,591 cases reported and losses surging to Rs 817.7 crore. In 2025, till June, 184 cases were registered, with reported losses amounting to Rs 70.7 crore.Investigators say awareness is the key - knowing how scammers operate, their usual modus operandi and how they manage to extract an OTP. To protect yourself, it is vital to remain composed rather than react out of fear. If you receive an unexpected call claiming your power supply will be cut off or a mystery package has arrived in your name, take a moment to reflect, then hang up and block the caller. Most importantly, never disclose an OTP to anyone.In the meantime, equip yourself with knowledge - how cyber cons operate, what are their most common predatory tactics, and how you can protect your privacy and data. These and many more insights into cybercrime that can help fortify your defences will be shared by Delhi Police special commissioner (crime) Devesh Chandra Srivastava, who is the distinguished guest at TOI's first 'Don'tGetScammed' Townhall in the city at 11.30am on Saturday (Dec 27) at Unesco Apartments, IP Extension, in east Delhi's Patparganj.","This year alone, Delhi has seen a staggering number of complaints, with scammers swindling residents of more than Rs 100 crore.

It must be carried out only at authorized slaughterhouses, or they will face penal action. Covered sale of meat, use of clean steel tools, proper freezers, and strict adherence to hygiene norms would be mandatory.”Taking note of the issue, the mayor convened a meeting of meat vendors and apprised them of the civic rules and upcoming restrictions.During the meeting, vendors requested that the implementation be deferred till Dec due to Christmas and New Year celebrations. Accepting the plea, the mayor granted temporary relaxation for Dec but made it clear that the rule would be enforced strictly from Jan.Meat vendor Ankur Pal, said, “Most meat sellers in the city were already keeping their shops closed on Tuesdays out of respect for public sentiment. Only a few used to operate, which often led to objections. This decision will ensure uniformity and prevent unnecessary disputes.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark Indies, opened in red on Friday on lacklustre global and domestic cues. While Nifty50 was just above 26,100, BSE Sensex was down over 140 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,101.30, down 41 points or 0.16%. BSE Sensex was at 85,267.87, down 141 points or 0.16%.Indian equity markets are expected to move in a narrow range as investors remain cautious in the absence of any major domestic economy triggers.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “With only four more trading days left for the year 2025, what looked like a Santa rally, appears to be running out of steam. In the absence of fresh triggers like a US-India trade deal, the market is likely to consolidate around the present levels. Higher US GDP growth of 4.3% for the third quarter of 2025 is imparting resilience to the US market. The high and rising profitability of US companies, including the AI ones, might nudge other FIIs, particularly the fleet footed hedge funds, to increase selling in India in the near-term.”“The sustained buying by the cash rich DIIs will support the market and prevent a sharp pull back.The ideal investment strategy for investors now is to remain invested in high quality large caps and slowly accumulate them on declines. A rally in the market in the early stage of 2026 is on the cards. Investors should give high weightage to value while deciding to invest. Irrational valuations in some of the IPOs and the willingness of the newbie investors to buy stocks at excessive valuations are reflections of exuberance in the market. ”Asian markets saw modest gains on Friday amid thin trading conditions. Japanese and South Korean equities advanced, while several other regional markets remained closed for holidays. In the commodities market, silver surged to a record high, while gold traded close to its all-time peak.Oil prices edged higher on Friday after the United States stepped up economic pressure on Venezuelan oil exports and carried out airstrikes against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of the Nigerian government.On the institutional front, foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of Indian equities worth Rs 1,721 crore on Wednesday, while domestic institutional investors provided support by purchasing shares worth Rs 2,381 crore.",Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in red on Friday on lacklustre global and domestic cues.

KOLKATA: Are you hooked on ‘herbal tea’? Do you unwind sipping on ‘flower tea’?Your favourite hot beverages have suddenly lost their ‘tea’ tag, though their appeal is set to endure.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued a directive on Dec 24 asking all food business operators and e-commerce platforms not to use the word ‘tea’ for any kind of blends or infusions that do not come from tea plants, whose scientific name is Camellia sinensis.The flavoured tea segment in India is growing rapidly — around 40%-45% annually — driven by urbanisation and evolving taste preferences. Tea industry experts estimate that the size of the flavoured or infusion tea market is around 60 million kg in volume and Rs 3,600 crore in value, accounting for around 10% of packaged tea consumption.“It has come to the notice of FSSAI that some Food Business Operators (FBOs) are marketing products that are not obtained from the plant Camellia sinensis under the name ‘Tea’, such as ‘Rooibos Tea’, ‘Herbal Tea’, ‘Flower Tea’, etc...It is clarified that, as per standards specified under 2.10.1 of the Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011, tea (including Kangra Tea, Green Tea, and Instant Tea in solid form) shall be exclusively from the plant of the Camellia sinensis,” the FSSAI order of Dec 24 states.Sub-regulation (1) of regulation 5 of the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2020 specifies that every package shall carry the name of the food, which indicates the true nature of the food, on the front of the pack.“Therefore, the use of the word ‘Tea’ directly or indirectly for any other plant-based or herbal infusions or blends not derived from Camellia sinensis is misleading and amounts to misbranding under the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the rules/regulations made thereunder,” the regulator has observed.Given the regulation, FSSAI has stated that plant-based or herbal infusions or blends not derived from Camellia sinensis do not qualify to be called ‘tea’.“Accordingly, all Food Business Operators, including e-commerce platforms engaged in manufacturing, packing, marketing, import, or sale of such products, are directed to... refrain from using the term ‘Tea’ for any products not derived from Camellia sinensis,” the order says.Bijoy Gopal Chakraborty, president of Confederation of Indian Small Tea Growers’ Association (CISTA), said, “Tea itself is a natural healthy wellness drink, and we should promote it and drink it.”Rudra Chatterjee, managing director of Luxmi Group, which owns Makaibari Tea Estate in Kalimpong, whole-heartedly backs FSSAI’s definition that ‘tea’ only refers to the leaves of Camellia sinensis. The clarity, he said, protects both consumers and India’s tea growers.“At the same time, India’s long tradition of herbal and botanical infusions — tulsi, turmeric, ginger, ashwagandha and countless others — is finding a powerful global moment of its own, not as tea, but as a distinct and deeply Indian category of wellness beverages,” he said.So, what’s in a name? That which we call rose tea, by any other name would taste as refreshing.",The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued a directive on Dec 24 asking all food business operators and e-commerce platforms not to use the word ‘tea’ for any kind of blends or infusions that do not come from tea plants. The flavoured tea segment in India is growing rapidly.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126182449,imgsize-2417719,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/rose-tulsi-if-chai-isn39t-purely-from-tea-plant-you-can39t-call-it-tea-fssai.jpg"

Poll shock: Trump’s longtime critic Jerome Powell is more popular than the president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poll-shock-trumps-longtime-critic-jerome-powell-is-more-popular-than-the-president/articleshow/126148126.cms,"

What the poll reveals about Trump and Powell



Trump trails despite strong Republican support



A long-running clash



Rates, policy and public moments





Jerome Powell has emerged as the most popular figure among senior US leaders, according to a new national survey. The finding places him ahead of President Donald Trump , whose approval rating remains near historic lows.The results come from a Gallup national poll conducted in early December 2025. The survey was carried out between December 1 and 15 and included roughly 1,000 US adults. It measured job approval for 13 major political and institutional figures.Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey. Trump’s approval rating stood at 36%, which Gallup described as a new low for his second term and only slightly above his all-time low of 34% recorded in 2021.Only two figures crossed the 40% threshold. Powell ranked first, followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who registered a 41% approval rating. All other leaders included in the poll remained below that level.The survey shows that Trump’s approval remains sharply polarised along partisan lines. About 89% of Republicans approve of his performance, while support among independents is far lower and approval among Democrats is near zero.This divide continues to pull the president’s overall rating into the mid-30s.Powell’s numbers also reflect partisan division. While his 44% approval does not represent majority support, it remains the strongest net rating among all the figures tested in the poll.The result is notable given Trump’s repeated and public attacks on Powell throughout 2025. The president has criticised the Fed chair over interest-rate policy, called him a “loser,” and pressed the central bank to cut rates more aggressively to support economic growth.Trump has also suggested that Powell should resign and has openly weighed replacing him when his term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, despite having nominated Powell to the position during his first term.The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year as it seeks to support a slowing economy. The most recent cut, announced in December, lowered the benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%.Tensions between the two men have also played out publicly. In July, Powell corrected Trump during a visit to the Federal Reserve after the president misstated renovation costs at the Fed’s headquarters, an exchange that drew widespread attention.Gallup noted that no leader in the survey approached 50% approval, highlighting a broader mood of dissatisfaction with national leadership. The poll measures job approval rather than personal favourability or voting intent and reflects deep partisan divides across nearly all figures tested.","Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey.
