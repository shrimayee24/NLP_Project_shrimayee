BJP win in Chhattisgarh turned the tide in decisive fight against Naxals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-win-in-chhattisgarh-turned-the-tide-in-decisive-fight-against-naxals/articleshow/121328500.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Rendering the CPI(Maoist) headless with the elimination of its top leader Basavaraju , did not come in one single blow but through sustained, intelligence-based strikes aimed at demolishing the Maoist ‘safe havens’ one by one, but which really gathered stream after the change of govt in Chhattisgarh in December 2023.Though home minister Amit Shah had conceived the mission to uproot Left-wing extremism soon after taking over in 2019 — envisaging moving of the security forces into Naxal “strongholds” untouched by administration or policing and introducing the locals there to the Centre’s flagship schemes — the “double engine” model really kicked in with installation of the BJP govt in Chhattisgarh, the state most affected by Maoist violence. Successes had been achieved by then in tackling and eliminating Maoists from their pocket boroughs in Bihar and Jharkhand, and taking the fight to Abujhmad region in Chhattisgarh, where the top Maoist leadership was ensconced, was the next logical step.What has followed after 2023 is seamless coordination between the Centre and its agencies like CRPF, IB and BSF, on the one hand, and the Chhattisgarh govt and state police with its specialised anti-Naxal wings like district reserve guard (DRG) and special taskforce (STF).Over the past one-and-a-half years, these agencies have worked as per a well-laid out strategy to to neutralise the outfit’s senior, middle and lower-rung leadership and cadres, challenge them in what they thought were their “secure” bastions; and push back the Maoists to shrink their area of influence was shrunk to a few pockets dotting the inter-state tri-junctions.The statistics speak for the success of these coordinated efforts — 401 Maoists were neutralised, 1429 were arrested and 1355 surrendered in Chhattisgarh between December 1, 2023 and May 21, 2025.To ensure that the Maoists do not reenter areas freed from their hold, the CRPF has been setting up security camps or forward operating bases (FOBs) there. Since 2019, nearly 555 such camps have been established, increasing security presence and facilitating an administrative push in the surrounding villages. The benefits of development and pressure on the Maoists with sustained operations meanwhile encouraged a wave of surrenders. Maoists, faced with depleted strength due to killing, arrests and surrenders of their cadres, are now appealing for ceasefire and talks. But the Centre is in no mood to relent and is focused on dealing the final blow to Naxalism and eliminating it well within the March 2026 deadline. . Operation Black Forest conducted from April 22 to May 11 and now the Narayanpur operation — which have together eliminated 58 Maoists, including their top leader Basavaraju — are part of that final blow. While Operation Black Forest successfully displaced the senior CPI(Maoist) leadership and the most potent PLGA battalion no 1 from their Karreguttalu Hills hideout on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, forcing them to take refuge in segregated pockets with a depleted arsenal and supplies, the Narayanapur operation has hit them like never before, rendering the outfit headless.Wednesday’s operation also showcases the success of DRG experiment to utilise surrendered Naxals for anti-Maoist operations. DRG had been taking the lead in joint operations, with its commandos well-versed with the terrain and topography of Maoists’ forest hideouts and familiar with their operational tactics. Armed with pinpointed intelligence, DRG achieved its biggest success on Wednesday — Basavaraju, who according to former CRPF DG K Vijay Kumar operated with Ninja-like stealth, was finally cornered and taken down by the very men who he had once commanded.","Home minister Amit Shah had conceived the mission to uproot Left-wing extremism soon after taking over in 2019.

Oral Contraceptives May Triple Stroke Risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oral-contraceptives-may-triple-stroke-risk/articleshow/121324081.cms,"New Delhi: Women who use a combined oral contraceptive (COC)—better known as the pill—are three times more likely to suffer an unexpected stroke than those who don't. These new findings were presented at a conference of European Stroke Organisation in Finland's Helsinki on May 20.The pill is a hormonal contraceptive, containing both oestrogen and progestogen , which prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg each month. A research at Istanbul University in Turkiye has established the connection between cryptogenic ischaemic stroke (CIS) and oral contraceptives. The research analysed 268 women, aged 18 to 49 years, who experienced unexpected strokes, comparing them with 268 women in the similar age group without a stroke history.Studies from 2019 and 2022 highlighted similar concerns. The discovery of direct vascular effects of COCs requires immediate attention. Healthcare professionals acknowledge that extended usage periods and increased oestrogen levels heighten stroke risks.Dr Anuradha Kapur, principal director (obstetrics & gynaecology) and head of the unit at Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, pointed out that while medicines could notably raise the likelihood of ischaemic strokes, they typically required existing risk elements to cause harm.""Think of it as adding gasoline to a fire that has not yet been lit. If you have a genetic factor or already have a risk factor, the pill can be the trigger,"" she clarified.However, research findings demonstrated that the increased stroke risk associated with oral contraceptive use appears to operate independently, as no significant associations were found between contraceptive usage and other documented risk factors.""Our findings confirm earlier evidence linking oral contraceptives to stroke risk,"" said Dr Mine Sezgin of the neurology department at Istanbul University and the lead author of the study. ""What's particularly notable is that the association remains strong even when accounting for other known risk factors, which suggests there may be additional mechanisms involved—possibly genetic or biological.""Dr Renu Gupta, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute Delhi, emphasised that stroke resulted from multiple factors, including genetic, physiological and lifestyle-related risks. She noted that COC could trigger complications in women with underlying health conditions, including undiagnosed thrombophilias or autoimmune conditions.While the researchers note that further prospective studies are needed, they advise clinicians to exercise caution when prescribing the pill to women with known vascular risk factors or a history of ischaemic stroke.Describing the connection between oral contraceptives and stroke, prof Manjari Tripathi, head of the neurology department at AIIMS, explained that COC usage consistently correlated with increased ischaemic stroke risk, particularly in women with pre-existing health risk factors. COC usage increases ischaemic stroke risk by 1.6 to 2 times, with higher risks in women experiencing migraines with aura. The risk intensifies for women who smoke, have high blood pressure, migraines with aura, or a stroke history. The oestrogen component potentially increases blood coagulability and clot formation.Dr Vinit Suri, senior consultant of neurology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, noted that first-year usage presented the highest risk, affected by oestrogen dosage. Modern pills contain lower oestrogen levels, reducing risks compared to older formulations, he pointed out. Risk increases with smoking, hypertension or age above 35. Healthy young women face minimal absolute risk, with pregnancy presenting higher stroke risks than oral contraceptives.""The real risk lies in stacking oestrogen on top of other vascular triggers—smoking, uncontrolled hypertension or migraine with aura—where non-oestrogen methods are clearly the wiser bet,"" said Dr Bhaskar Shukla, consultant neurologist at PSRI Hospital. Informed choice, annual check-ups and the growing menu of highly effective LARC devices mean women no longer have to trade peace of mind for modern contraception, he added.","Women who use combined oral contraceptive (COC) are three times more likely to suffer an unexpected stroke than those who don't.

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies dismantled a high-stakes espionage ring in a meticulously planned three-month-long covert operation, dealing a significant blow to ISI's attempts to carry out a terrorist strike in the national capital. The operation culminated in the arrest of two highly trained individuals, including Ansarul Miya Ansari , a Pakistani operative tasked with gathering sensitive information about Indian armed forces, sources said.The probe also points a finger of suspicion at some staffers of Pak High Commission in Delhi. It's suspected that ISI officers Muzammil and Ehsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish who had been cultivating Indian Youtubers and influencers were in on the plot.The operation kicked off with a vague tip in Jan that a spy had been dispatched by ISI to collect sensitive documents/pictures/Google coordinates and was to arrive in Delhi via Nepal. The sleuths then developed the tip which revealed that an attack in Delhi was being planned and classified information about the armed forces was to be used to plan a terror attack.Despite the high stakes, intelligence officials had to wait till mid-Feb to make headway.The ISI agent had arrived in Delhi and had collected confidential military documents, sources said. The trap was set, and on Feb 15, Ansari was apprehended in central Delhi with sensitive documents while he was on his way back to Pakistan via Nepal.The operation, sources said, was a masterclass in espionage craft, with the agency officials staying one step ahead of the spy at every turn. ""Our men were making efforts to collect information about Pak-backed terror outfits active in different parts of India and sleeper cells providing logistic support to them. After some grenade attacks outside police establishments in Punjab were carried out by ISI-backed terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa Internation (BKI), the agency suspected a larger plot to threaten public safety in north-western India,"" said the source.""In view of this, proactive steps were taken to prevent any such planning of terror attack in Delhi-NCR. Sources were activated which culminated in the tip about this suspect's travel plans.""Ansari was subsequently handed over to the police who then booked him for possessing and attempting to supply confidential documents related to the Indian Armed Forces to his Pakistani handlers. An FIR under the Officials Secrets Act was registered.The investigation also uncovered the role of Akhlaque Azam, a resident of Ranchi, who was providing logistic support to Ansarul in India. The two were in constant communication with their Pakistani handlers, and their conversations were laced with suspicion and intrigue, sources said. Azam was subsequently arrested in March.The analysis of their mobile devices uncovered suspicious conversations between both the arrested accused and their Pakistani handlers, which suggested a larger conspiracy. A few days ago, a chargesheet was filed in court against the two suspects even as further investigation is underway to identify more individuals involved in the conspiracy.But who was Ansari? A deep dive into his background revealed a complex web of deceit and radicalisation. During interrogation, Ansari revealed that he originally belonged to Nepal but had been living and working as a taxi driver in Qatar since 2008, where he was recruited by an ISI operative. Money was the first incentive and the brainwashing about the 'bigger cause' followed. He was asked to go to Pakistan and meet his handler in Rawalpindi.""In June 2024, he visited Pakistan for a month, where he was introduced to high-ranking officials of the Pakistani Army and radicalised by discussing issues like the Babri Masjid demolition and the implementation of CAA/NRC in India. Ansari was also trained in espionage and tasked with procuring secret documents from Delhi,"" a report filed in court reads.The trial is about commence shortly with the court having taken cognisance of the chargesheet. The two arrested men are lodged in high security wing of Tihar jail. A special watch is being kept over them so that they may not attempt to brainwash other inmates, sources said.

Waqf boards and Hindu endowment boards can't be compared: Centre in SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-boards-and-hindu-endowment-boards-cant-be-compared-centre-in-sc/articleshow/121324856.cms,"NEW DELHI:

After countering the Muslim side's argument that non-Muslims could theoretically form a majority in the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards, Centre told Supreme Court Wednesday that an ill-founded attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta exhibited documents, including the minority affairs ministry's written assurance to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its affidavit in SC, to apprise a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih that the council and boards would never lose their minority character as an overwhelming majority of members would always be Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal had taken nearly 30 minutes on Tuesday to highlight apprehension among Muslims about the council and boards losing their minority character by claiming that the govt, through the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, at least theoretically intended to make non-Muslims the majority in these two bodies. He had asked when the govt never attempted to make non-believers in Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity members in their religious endowment boards, why were waqfs of Muslims singled out. He termed it discrimination on the ground of religion, which violated the fundamental right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 15.Mehta said Hindu religious endowment board members entered temples and even supervised rituals.The charity commissioner, who can be non-Hindu, can appoint archakas (pujaris) and remove them for not performing rituals or for immoral activities, and SC had upheld this by terming appointment of archakas as a secular activity, he added.The SG said Hindu personal laws were codified in 1956, but Muslims continued to be governed by Sharia law. Adjudicating a petition highlighting this discrimination, SC in 1996 had said such a comparison was not possible and reforms in personal law and religious activities were a gradual process.""There cannot be any comparison with Hindu religious endowment boards as they deal with religion and rituals. But the boards deal with management of waqf properties, which is a secular activity, and the state has the power to regulate it through legislation. None of the petitioners has challenged Parliament's legislative competence to enact the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025,"" the SG said.He said the JPC had consulted Archaeological Survey of India on ancient monuments being taken out of the purview of waqf. ASI said while religious activities, which have been going on for years, had not been stopped in protected and ancient monuments, waqf boards managing these monuments as waqfs had unilaterally allowed commercial activities in these ancient spaces, hindering preservation and conservation works.Mehta said in certain cases, waqf boards had restrained ASI from carrying out repair and restoration work in ancient monuments.","Centre says attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.

Supreme Court Rejects Sri Lankan Tamil's Plea, Says India Not A 'Dharamshala' For Refugees

Poll In your opinion, should there be stricter regulations for civil service applicants regarding reservations? Yes, to prevent misuse. No, current rules are sufficient.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to former IAS probationer Puja Khedkar, who is accused of cheating in the civil services process by wrongly claiming reservation benefits under the OBC and disability quotas.A bench comprising Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said, ""What is the grave crime she has committed? She is not a drug lord or a terrorist. She has not committed 302 (murder). She is not an NDPS offender. You should have a system or software. You complete the investigation. She has lost everything and will not get a job anywhere.""The Delhi Police and UPSC both had opposed her anticipatory bail, saying she had defrauded the commission and the public. The Delhi High Court also dismissed her anticipatory bail plea, removing her interim protection. The UPSC had canceled her candidature and debarred her from taking any future exams. Central government also formally discharged her from the Indian Administrative Service, citing Rule 12 of the IAS (Probation) Rules.Khedkar came under public and legal scrutiny after her controversial posting in Pune, which was later changed to Washim by the Maharashtra government following allegations of power misuse.Her case took a serious turn when the state’s OBC welfare minister ordered an investigation into her claims of belonging to the OBC non-creamy layer.She is accused of submitting false certificates to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to pass the highly competitive civil services exams. Reports suggest she used multiple certificates showing different disabilities, including mental illness, low vision, and locomotor issues.A major point of concern has been the use of different names during the application process—Khedkar Puja Deeliprao and Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar—which raised doubts about the number of attempts she made. She was also accused of using the name change to bypass the rule on maximum exam attempts.Before her IAS selection, she was serving as an Indian Revenue Service officer and was posted with the Sports Authority of India. She had previously used the OBC and PwBD (low vision) categories for her IRS post, but later used PwBD (multiple disabilities) and a new OBC certificate to qualify for the IAS.","Former IAS probationer Puja Khedkar is accused of cheating in the civil services process.

The court also observed ""inherent contradictions"" in the wife's statements regarding consent while highlighting the exception of ""implied consent"" in marriage under current rape law.The court observed that Section 377 of the IPC, which penalises certain sexual acts, would not be applicable within a marital relationship, especially in the absence of any allegation of lack of consent.""In the context of a marital relationship, Section 377 of IPC cannot be applied to criminalise non-penile-vaginal intercourse between a husband and wife. Such an interpretation would be in line with the reasoning and observations of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar (case),"" the court said in its May 13 order.Additionally, it observed that the wife had not explicitly stated whether the act was committed against her will or without her consent.The wife alleged that the husband was ""impotent"" and claimed their marriage was part of a conspiracy by him and his father to establish illicit relations and extort money from her family.In response, the husband maintained that the marriage was legally valid and that there was an implied presumption of consent for consensual sexual acts within it, which could not attract charges under Section 377.Noting an ""inherent contradiction"" in the wife's statements, the judge pointed out that she simultaneously accused the man of sexual incapacity while also alleging that he had performed oral sex.""The essential ingredient of lack of consent – central to constituting an offence under Section 377 of IPC post-Navtej Singh Johar (case) between any two adults – is clearly missing. Thus, there is not only a lack of prima facie case, but even the threshold of strong suspicion is not met,"" the court said.""No prima facie case is made out against the petitioner for the offence under Section 377 of IPC. The impugned order directing the framing of charge is, therefore, unsustainable in law and is liable to be set aside,"" it added.The court further noted that acts like anal or oral intercourse fall within the scope of rape under Section 375(a) of the IPC, but also clarified that there was no reason to believe the petitioner would not be covered by the legal immunity granted to husbands under the exception to the rape provision.""There is no basis to assume that a husband would not be protected from prosecution under Section 377 of IPC, in view of exception 2 to Section 375 of IPC since the law (amended Section 375 of IPC) now presumes implied consent for sexual intercourse as well as sexual acts, including anal or oral intercourse within a marital relationship,"" it said.","Delhi high court quashed an order regarding prosecution of a husband under Section 377 for performing ""unnatural"" sex with his wife.

"India, EU may finalise interim FTA by July",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eu-may-finalise-interim-fta-by-july/articleshow/121324834.cms,"NEW DELHI: After the UK, India is now looking to close an ""early harvest"" trade agreement with the European Union as soon as July with both sides looking to push exports amid the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump's moves on tariffs.Negotiators from both sides are working overtime to finalise the trade pact - which has been in the pipeline for close to two decades - with a team led by India's chief negotiator Satya Srinivas returning to Brussels this week.Govt is expected to offer tariff concessions similar to the ones it has agreed to with the UK, including reducing the levy on automobiles to as low as 10%, while slashing duties on wines, certain types of meat and poultry. In return, it would want the trading bloc to offer easier access to Indian garments, pharmaceuticals, steel and oil products.The interim agreement will not be limited to tariffs and may also include issues such as intellectual property rights (IPRs), govt procurement, and non-tariff barriers, a senior official said. A few years ago, India had entered into an interim pact with Australia, although it had worked out a comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK.Sources indicated that the proposed pact with Oman, which is stuck mainly on the issue of petrochemicals, may also be finalised soon as govt broadens its trade engagement to push exports, both of goods and services.India and EU have agreed to conclude the agreement in two phases on account of the uncertain global trade environment, sources said.In recent months, the talks have received a fillip, thanks to the signals coming from the highest levels. EU too is seen to be more accommodative of India's position on several counts, something it was unwilling to do earlier.","Negotiators from both sides are working overtime to finalise the trade pact.

Law requiring registration of waqf properties there since 1923: Govt to SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/law-requiring-registration-of-waqf-properties-there-since-1923-govt-to-sc/articleshow/121324543.cms,"SG: Muslim side made false claims to project misleading picture to SC

NEW DELHI: Producing historical proof that the law mandated registration of all kinds of waqf properties, including those in the 'waqf by user' category, since 1923, Centre on Wednesday told Supreme Court that the legal requirement was deliberately flouted to subserve vested interests, a menace sought to be eradicated by the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta punched holes in submissions of senior advocate Kapil Sibal , who is the lead counsel for the Muslim side challenging the validity of the 2025 law, by pointing out how the petitioners had attempted to portray falsehood and mislead a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih. Mehta said Sibal had made false statements or suppressed provisions relating to several issues.Solicitor General Mehta said senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who is the lead counsel for the Muslim side, had made false statements or suppressed provisions relating to several issues - the content of bill placed in Parliament after incorporating JPC recommendations, ancient Islamic monuments being made out of bounds for religious activities of Muslims, non-Muslims in Waqf Council and Boards, inquiry into waqf land in dispute, and identification of govt land treated as waqf - to project a misleading picture before court.Living up to Sibal's prophecy on Tuesday that if he raised 10 questions on validity of the 2025 Act, the SG would have 11 answers to it, Mehta said the fact that only a Muslim could create a waqf and it must be registered had been mandatory since 1923. However, before the 2014 LS elections, the UPA govt in Dec 2013 amended Waqf Act, 1995, to allow anyone to make a waqf, ostensibly to appease Muslims and for vote-bank politics.Sibal had on Tuesday argued that the requirement for registration of waqf properties had been inserted in the new law in order to appropriate properties of Muslims.""How can someone declare another person's property, even if it had been used for a long time, as a waqf? How can someone declare an encroached govt land as waqf? Should there be no inquiry and proof be asked about it?"" Mehta asked, adding that none of the affected parties had approached the SC and that the challenge was through PILs.He said the govt had appointed a three-member committee comprising distinguished persons to study the waqf property mismanagement issue. In its detailed report in 1976, the committee said concealment of waqf and wilful non-registration of waqf properties was a deeply prevailing malady in administration of waqfs. The committee had recommended that if a waqf was not registered, then the mutawalli could not file a suit.Mehta said in 1984, Parliament amended the Waqf Act and provided that no suit would be maintainable in relation to an unregistered waqf. But because of political reasons, this amendment was never brought into force, Mehta said. ""This provision was there in the Waqf Act, 1995, but was deleted by the 2013 amendment Act,"" he added, referring to the changes the UPA govt carried out before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.He rubbished Sibal's argument that once a govt officer declares a property not to be a waqf, without any judicial adjudication, the Muslims had no remedy. Mehta said every process of identification of govt land or private property was subject to the provisions of Civil Procedure Code and amenable to challenge before a court of law.For govt or a private party to get title over its land, wrongly identified as waqf property and in possession of a waqf, concerned person must approach a civil court for getting ownership title over it, which is a judicial process.He said the minority affairs ministry had assured the JPC in writing and filed an affidavit before the SC declaring that a maximum of four out of total 22 members in the Central Waqf Council and three out of 11 in state Auqaf Boards could be non-Muslims. ""This does not alter the minority character of the council and boards,"" he said, refuting the argument that the number of Muslims on waqf bodies would come down substantially under the new law.He said the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904 and 1958 categorically stated that the religious character of ancient and protected monuments, which are more than 100 years old, would not change, irrespective of their status as waqf property. The arguments will continue on Thursday.",Solicitor General Tushar Mehta punched holes in submissions of senior advocate Kapil Sibal. Sibal is the lead counsel for the Muslim side challenging the validity of the 2025 law. He had argued that the requirement for registration of waqf properties had been inserted in the new law in order to appropriate properties of Muslims.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121324800,imgsize-98608,width-400,resizemode-4/121324800.jpg"

India seeks US duty cuts for labour-intensive sectors

NEW DELHI: India hopes to revert to the pre-April 2 status for its exports, especially in the labour intensive sectors, as part of the bilateral trade deal with US in return for concessions for American imports, including farm products.""Talks are moving positively. Before July 8, we are looking at concluding an interim deal ahead of the first tranche. It will include goods, non-tariff barriers, some areas of services like digital. We're trying that 26% additional duty and 10% baseline tariff shouldn't be there for India,"" an official said.While the reciprocal tariffs were suspended for 90 days, the 10% baseline duty on all countries is in place, making exports uncompetitive. A full-fledged trade deal, which involves coverage of 85-90% of products from both sides, referred to as ""substantial coverage"", is unlikely till Trump administration gets a green light from Congress for reducing levies below the most-favoured nation rates applicable to all countries. tnnIt can, however, remove the reciprocal tariffs imposed on countries, including India.Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal and a team of Indian negotiators is currently in the US holding detailed discussions on a bilateral trade agreement that was agreed to by Trump and PM Narendra Modi by Fall (Sept-Oct). Govt was earlier seeking an ""early tranche"" before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends, but officials indicated that talks have been progressing well.""Good discussions with secretary @HowardLutnick towards expediting the first tranche of India-US bilateral trade agreement,"" Goyal posted on social media on Tuesday after meeting the US commerce secretary.Govt is seeking duty concessions for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather goods, gems and jewellery, plastics, chemicals, shrimps, oil seeds and some Indian fruits. The US has been demanding duty cuts for its automobiles, especially electric vehicles such as Tesla, whiskey, wine, petrochemicals, dairy, and farm goods, including genetically modified crops.While India is open to lowering customs duty for farm products, it is unlikely to allow genetically-modified products to enter the country. If the US-UK trade deal is a pointer, Washington offered concessions on some 100-odd products while managing to extract duty cuts for around 2,500 American goods as well as commitments for more aircraft and other purchases.To ward off tariffs, India too may have to give more than it can get, including more LNG, fertiliser and defence purchases, experts have argued.","India hopes to revert to the pre-April 2 status for its exports, especially in the labour intensive sectors.

ED: Gandhis gained from Herald scam, Cong & its donors are victims

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday told a special court here that Congress veteran Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul received Rs 142 crore in ""proceeds of crime"" after acquiring Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) through Young Indian, a company in which they together held 76% stakes.The agency told the court of special judge Vishal Gogne that a 'prima facie' case of money laundering was established against Sonia, Rahul and others in the case involving the acquisition of AJL - publisher of Congress mouthpieces National Herald and Qaumi Awaz - by Young Indian. The court will continue hearing arguments in the case on a day-to-day basis from July 2-8.In its prosecution complaint (chargesheet), ED has made Sonia and Rahul accused No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, besides naming five others, including close associates Sam Pitroda and Suman Dubey.ED's case is based on the charge that Congress provided an interest-free loan of Rs 90 crore to AJL, which owns significant real estate in different parts of the country. When AJL failed to repay, Congress, then led by Sonia, transferred AJL to Young Indian, a newly promoted ""not-for-profit"" in which she was a director along with Rahul, and they together held 76% stakes.As a result, Young Indian ended up controlling assets worth Rs 752 crore, mostly in the form of buildings or land in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Indore, Chandigarh and Patna, allotted to AJL by Congress govts for bringing out National Herald and other party journals.ED has also alleged that Young Indian paid Rs 50 lakh - arranged through a Kolkata-based shell company Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd - to repay AJL's Rs 90-crore loan to Congress as full and final settlement. The company is one of the seven accused named in the chargesheet, which was filed before the court on April 9. Young Indian was launched in Nov 2010, with Dubey and Pitroda as directors and a paid-up capital of Rs 5 lakh, according to the chargesheet. By early next year, they had transferred their shares to the Gandhis, clearing the way for them to acquire assets, and going by an assessment done by the Income Tax department, these were worth Rs 752 crore. The current market value of the assets is worth Rs 2,000 crore, according to the ED chargesheet.Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general S V Raju told the court that the Gandhis and other accused were enjoying proceeds of crime of Rs 142 crore until the ED attached these (AJL) properties (worth Rs 752 crore in Nov 2023).As Raju and advocate Zoheb Hossain, special counsel for ED, pressed the court to take cognisance of the chargesheet, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Gandhis, sought time until July on grounds that voluminous records and documents needed scrutiny. The court allowed ED to proceed with its opening arguments, despite Singhvi's objection.The hearing took an interesting turn when Raju suggested Congress and those who made donations to it were also victims of the alleged scam. He argued that while it was Congress that loaned Rs 90 crore to AJL, assets of the company were transferred to Gandhi-controlled Young Indian and not the party - an interesting line of reasoning which in the coming days may develop into a larger argument about Sonia and Rahul allegedly benefiting at the expense of Congress members as well as its donors.Meanwhile, the court directed ED to provide a copy of its chargesheet in the matter to Subramanian Swamy, based on whose private complaint the agency had lodged the present money laundering case.During the hearing, Raju and Hossain focused on the generation of proceeds of crime, which, Hossain said, not only included those properties obtained from the scheduled offence but also other activity such as getting 'donations' and 'bogus' rentals.""Rental income worth Rs 142 crore received by the accused will be included in this,"" Hossain said. He submitted that the matter pertains to criminal conspiracy allegedly involving three entities - AJL, Young Indian and Congress.On Sonia and Rahul becoming shareholders of Young Indian, the judge asked, ""The underlying allegation is ownership, is implicitly transferred to the first two accused, so who owns the properties as of date, Young Indian or AJL?... In very simple words, if property of 'A' is usurped by 'B', does it become proceeds of crime in the hands of 'B'?""The judge also asked if there is a forensic auditor with ED and said he wants to understand exactly how companies work and in what ways they are allowed to issue shares. Responding to the query, Hossain said he will get back with answers. He added, ""Whenever there is a fraud, then the court will probe into who are the real beneficial owners, which PMLA enables the court to do.""","ED: Gandhis gained from Herald scam, Cong & its donors are victims of the alleged scam.

'Heart Lamp' shines at Int'l Booker: First Kannada title and 1st short story collection to win prize,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-lamp-shines-at-intl-booker-first-kannada-title-and-1st-short-story-collection-to-win-prize/articleshow/121324532.cms,"Navy stitches past with present to sail into future

Kannada writer, lawyer, and activist Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi on Wednesday scripted history by winning the International Booker Prize for 'Heart Lamp', the first Kannada title and the first-ever collection of short stories to be awarded the 50,000 pounds (about Rs 58 lakh) prize.""This moment feels like a thousand fireflies lighting up a single sky - brief, brilliant, and utterly collective,"" said Mushtaq after receiving the award.The award was announced by bestselling Booker Prize-longlisted author Max Porter in his role as chair of the five-member voting panel, at a ceremony at London's Tate Modern. Hailing 'Heart Lamp' as ""something genuinely new for English readers"", Porter termed it a ""radical translation which ruffles language, to create new textures in a plurality of Englishes. It challenges and expands our understanding of translation"".Bhasthi is the first Indian translator - and ninth female translator - to win the prize since it took on its current form in 2016. Mushtaq is the sixth female author to be awarded the prize since then. It is the second time an Indian language book has won the International Booker Prize after Geetanjali Shree's 'Tomb of Sand', translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell, won the award in 2022.Mushtaq's collection of 12 short stories, translated from Kannada into English by Bhasthi, chronicles the everyday lives of women in patriarchal communities in southern India. In her acceptance speech, Mushtaq said it was an affirmation that ""we as individuals and as a global community can thrive when we embrace diversity, celebrate our differences and uplift one another.""The tales in 'Heart Lamp' were written over 30 years, from 1990 to 2023. agenciesThe Navy commissioned INSV Kaundinya , a 20m-long sailing yacht based on a 5th-century fresco at the Ajanta caves , at the Karwar naval base on Wednesday.The wooden ship , stitched together entirely by hand in Goa, will embark on a transoceanic voyage along the ancient trade route from Gujarat to Oman, scheduled for later this year. Naval officials said if the first voyage is successful, the yacht will then sail from Odisha to Indonesia later.The induction of this wooden vessel comes 40 years after the Navy decommissioned INS Bhatkal, its last wooden-hulled minesweeper.""We knew that these stitched ships were used to cross the ocean from very ancient times. We know that Indians were sailing the oceans from the bronze age, from the Harappan period. There's enough evidence of Indians crossing from the ports of Gujarat to Oman and Bahrain and going all the way to Mesopotamia,"" said Sanjeev Sanyal, PM's economic advisory council member, who initiated the whole project.""The problem is that there are no records of exactly what sea-going ships during the Harappan period looked like. There are some texts, like the 'Yukti Kalpa Taru', which we used. We used some testimonies of ancient travellers from other countries who came to Indian Ocean,"" said Sanyal.With no detailed blueprints available, multiple stakeholders put their heads together to get INSV Kaundinya to sail. ""From Sanyal's vision to Malayali shipwright Babu Sankaran's skill, and from the Navy's oversight to the Goan shipyard Hodi Innovations' determination, the stitched ship replica is a model for successful collaborations,"" said Commodore Srikant Kesnur (retd).INSV Kaundinya is named after India's first known mariner who, according to legend, established the Fuhan dynasty after marrying a Naga princess.""Kaundinya is not mentioned in Indian records, but we know of him from records of Cambodia and Vietnam. We can only guess where he came from, but just as a hint, there is still a gotra called Kaundinya that lives along the Odisha-Andhra coast, and it is possible that Kaundinya is actually not his first name but his gotra name,"" said Sanyal.","Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi win International Booker Prize for 'Heart Lamp' It is the first Kannada title and the first-ever collection of short stories to be awarded the prize.

Top stock market recommendations:Nifty had an inside bar formation after closing at a four day closing low on Tuesday. With 24800 breached with heavy volumes earlier this week, the same is now likely to act as resistance for sell on rise on Nifty as the index is now open to hit 214300 / 24100 on downside. After a 3300+ point rally from its April panic low to May high’s the index has barely retraced 450 odd points from its recent highs. With the price action seen from the start of this week, it is fair for the index to retest 200 DMA support on downside which currently reads below 24100.Bank Nifty has broken from its 6 week rising trendline in Tuesday’s closing trades. This puts the index back on track to retest its polarity support of its original 5 year rising trendline. Targets for this breakdown hint for a 1000-1200 odd point breakdown from Tuesday’s closing.A follow up move on downside breaking Tuesday’s low yesterday also confirms the same.After a 22% rally from its recent low, Bosch is showing signs of exhaustion. With price action seen on Tuesday, the stock has closed below its previous week’s high as well as at a 4 day low. A 6% to 8% cool off is expected to play out given the heat up seen on the stock.Computer Age Management Services (CAMS) has given a sloping trendline breakout on Friday last week, while the price on Tuesday is more of a pullback on the breakout seen on charts of CAMS. This pullback is likely to act as a buy on dip for an upside of 4200 odd.Flag breakout on the daily chart is seen on charts of ONGC, with the neckline being crossed in last week’s trade. Highest closing for the month is seen on daily charts which is likely to add traction on the upside to the tune of 5-7%.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Computer Age Management Services, and ONGC are the top buy calls for today.

What is Indian ePassport & is it mandatory for current passport holders to replace theirs with a new chip-based one?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-is-indian-epassport-is-it-mandatory-for-current-passport-holders-to-replace-theirs-with-a-new-chip-based-one/articleshow/121316262.cms,"Visa Revokes, Rising Costs, & Trump 2.0: Should Indian Students Still Choose the U.S. in 2025?

Key benefits of ePassport



Enhanced Data Security: The ePassport stores information both in printed form and as a digitally signed electronic chip. Immigration officials worldwide can authenticate this data, reducing the risk of forgery and fraudulent passports.

Robust Encryption: Protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the ePassport’s chip ensures the integrity and origin of personal and biometric data.

International Standards Compliance: Following ICAO Document 9303 guidelines, the ePassport uses:

Basic Access Control (BAC): Restricts chip access to authorised scanning devices. Passive Authentication (PA): Verifies stored data and detects tampering. Extended Access Control (EAC): Adds an extra security layer for sensitive biometric information like fingerprints.

Streamlined Immigration: Biometric verification via ePassport allows automated and contactless checks at border control, significantly lowering wait times and easing the travel experience.

Global Compatibility: As ePassports meet ICAO specifications, they are accepted at checkpoints in most countries, simplifying international travel.

Fraud Prevention: Advanced security features make it difficult to tamper with or duplicate passports, deterring counterfeiters and protecting individual identities.

Traveler Convenience: Automated e-gates at airports enable ePassport holders to pass through immigration faster without manual inspections.

National Security: Including biometric data in passports strengthens border control by more accurately tracking cross-border movement and preventing identity theft.

Simplified Updates: Electronic storage makes renewing or updating personal details more efficient, speeding up the application process.

Digital Transformation: The ePassport supports India’s move toward paperless travel and digital identities, paving the way for future innovations in global mobility.

Is replacement mandatory for current Passport holders?



NEW DELHI: The Government of India has introduced the ePassport which is a combined paper and electronic passport featuring an embedded RFID chip and antenna.The chip securely stores the passport holder’s personal and biometric data and is visually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.With this rollout, India joins over 120 countries, including the United States, Canada, France, Japan, and Australia, in issuing biometric e-passports.This move aligns India with ICAO international standards and represents a major step forward in enhancing national security and streamlining cross-border travel.As global travel rebounds and border security becomes ever more critical, the ePassport equips Indian travellers with a safer, smoother experience abroad. By adopting biometric technology, India underscores its commitment to digital innovation and positions itself at the forefront of modern identity management.No, existing passports issued by the Government of India remain valid until their official expiry date. ePassports will be issued gradually as each Passport Office becomes technically equipped. This phased rollout across all Passport Offices in India may take a few months.Until then, holders of regular passports do not need to replace them.",The Government of India has introduced the ePassport which is a combined paper and electronic passport featuring an embedded RFID chip and antenna.

Jalen Brunson’s NBA salary and contract outlook



Jalen Brunson has quickly gone from an overlooked second-round draft pick to one of the most reliable point guards in the NBA. Now in his seventh season and firmly established as the leader of the New York Knicks, the 28-year-old guard continues to build momentum, both in his on-court performance and financial standing. As Brunson's profile grows, so do his partnerships, payouts, and public presence.Backed by playoff performances, a major contract extension, and steady off-court endorsements, Brunson's career trajectory continues to trend upward. His rise also reflects the league's changing landscape, where consistent guard play and leadership hold significant weight, both in the locker room and at the negotiating table.New York Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson continues to be one of the NBA’s most impactful guards, and his financial growth reflects that. In 2025, the 28-year-old’s net worth is estimated to be a minimum account size of $2 million according to Forbes, marking his rise not only as a top-tier athlete but also as a brand presence off the court.After signing a long-term deal with the Knicks and earning multiple All-Star selections, Brunson’s role in New York’s renewal has made him a recognizable figure in the league, both for his leadership and his growing endorsement footprint.Brunson is currently playing under a four-year, $104 million contract with the New York Knicks, which began in the 2022–23 season. For the 2024–25 campaign, he will earn a base salary of $24,960,001, according to league financial data.Looking ahead, his next contract is already lined up.

That deal will elevate his salary to $34,944,001 in the first year of the new contract, placing him among the highest-paid guards in the NBA.Off the floor, Jalen Brunson has aligned with a diverse group of brands. His endorsement partners include Nike, American Express, Dollar Shave Club, Hecho Tequila Soda, MSI Computers, Faherty Brand, DoorDash, BodyArmor, and Pedialyte.

Brunson has also made early moves in personal investment and brand building, though exact figures on those ventures remain private.Jalen Brunson is averaging 26.0 points, 7.3 assists, and 2.9 rebounds per game career-best numbers that reflect his continued growth as the New York Knicks’ primary playmaker.Beyond all the numbers, Brunson has used his platform for meaningful causes.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

Key observations:

Alternative destinations preferred: Travelers from Hong Kong and Taiwan are reportedly choosing South Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand over Japan in light of the prophecy.

Extended cancellations: According to WWPKG’s managing director CN Yuen, many travelers have not just postponed trips but have actively canceled existing summer bookings.

Flight and hotel adjustments: Airline carriers and hotels in Tokyo, Osaka, and Okinawa have begun to notice higher-than-expected cancellation rates for mid-year stays.

Official government responses

China’s advisory

Key recommendations included:

Keeping emergency kits at hand

Monitoring official announcements from local Japanese authorities

Avoiding coastal regions during the month of July

Japan’s meteorological stance

No unusual seismic patterns have been detected that would warrant a forecast for a major event in July 2025.

Japan’s earthquake early warning systems and volcano monitoring networks remain among the most sophisticated globally.

While public concern is understandable, the agency advised against “unverified sources” influencing safety-related decisions.

: Platforms like Reddit and Japanese BBS sites are filled with discussions about evacuation routes, emergency shelters, and seismic safety tips. Mixed reactions: While some users express genuine fear, others mock the hysteria, sharing memes juxtaposing Tatsuki’s manga illustrations with apocalyptic images.

Scientific and cultural context

Geological perspective:

The Japan Trench, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the Okhotsk Plate, is capable of generating powerful earthquakes.

The Nankai Trough, south of Honshu, is also a closely monitored seismic hotspot with a known history of producing megaquakes.

Scientists acknowledge the inevitability of future disasters but caution against relying on non-scientific forecasts for decision-making.

Sociocultural perspective:

In Japan, there is a long history of spiritual figures and oracles influencing public sentiment, especially in periods of national uncertainty.

The idea of “yogen” (prophecy) holds cultural significance in literature and public discourse.





A widely-circulated prophecy from a Japanese manga artist has led to a significant drop in travel bookings to Japan, particularly among East Asian tourists, as fears mount over a possible catastrophic natural disaster predicted for July 2025. Ryo Tatsuki , a little-known manga artist until recently, has been dubbed the “New Baba Vanga” following what many consider eerily accurate forecasts of past major events in Japan and beyond. Her renewed popularity stems from a prediction made in her updated 2021 edition of The Future I Saw, in which she foresees a large-scale disaster striking Japan and surrounding areas in mid-2025.The reaction has been swift and multifaceted. Tour operators in Hong Kong and Taiwan have reported sharp declines in bookings, with some experiencing a 50% drop during the Easter travel period. Chinese authorities have issued public advisories, and social media platforms are flooded with discussions, hashtags, and doomsday scenarios based on Tatsuki’s vision. While Japanese government officials have downplayed the concerns, the potential economic and psychological impact of the prophecy is growing.Ryo Tatsuki is a manga artist and self-proclaimed clairvoyant who first published her book The Future I Saw (Watashi ga Mita Mirai) in 1999. The book was largely overlooked at the time but later gained a cult following as readers began to connect her illustrated visions with real-world events.Among the events she reportedly predicted were:Tatsuki describes her visions as spontaneous flashes—often vivid dreams or mental images—that she records and draws. Her writing style is straightforward, and she refrains from offering interpretations, which has led some followers to consider her work more authentic and less dramatized than those of other self-described prophets.The specific prediction for July 2025 appears in an updated version of Tatsuki’s book released in 2021. In it, she sketches a scene of an undersea rupture occurring between Japan and the Philippines, which she claims will result in a tsunami “three times larger” than the 2011 event. Additionally, she references imagery of the sea boiling, which has sparked speculation about potential volcanic activity or submarine geothermal explosions.The areas she highlights in her prophecy include:These regions all sit atop or near the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active zone where tectonic plates frequently collide, leading to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. While scientists routinely monitor this region, the specificity and emotional impact of Tatsuki’s predictions have struck a chord, particularly among populations already sensitive to seismic threats.One of the most immediate consequences of the July 2025 prediction has been a steep decline in tourist interest in Japan. Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG reported a 50% drop in travel bookings for Japan during the Easter holiday season.While tourism to Japan has been recovering steadily since the COVID-19 pandemic, this prediction has introduced a new psychological barrier to travel, especially among visitors from East and Southeast Asia, where beliefs in premonitions and spiritual foresight are more culturally prevalent.In April 2025, the Chinese embassy in Tokyo issued a formal travel advisory. Citing “recent seismic activity” and “increased volcanic alerts,” the advisory urges Chinese nationals residing in or visiting Japan to take “extra precautions against natural disasters.”This advisory came after several minor earthquakes were recorded around Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands, as well as an uptick in tremors near Mount Aso, one of Japan’s most active volcanoes.In contrast, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has taken a more measured approach. Officials from JMA stated that:The Japanese government has not issued any emergency preparedness protocols specific to the prophecy but continues to emphasize routine readiness for earthquakes and tsunamis due to the country’s tectonic geography.The prophecy has gone viral, particularly on Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo and international outlets like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter (X). The hashtag #July2025Prediction has generated millions of views and sparked global debate.In addition, YouTube creators and bloggers across Japan and Taiwan have uploaded analysis videos exploring the scientific plausibility of Tatsuki’s claims, comparing her record to that of other famous mystics such as Baba Vanga, Nostradamus, and Jeane Dixon.Experts in seismology and sociology are split on the significance of such predictions. While there is no scientific basis for psychic visions, the cultural weight of premonitions in East Asia can have real-world implications.","Ryo Tatsuki claims to have foreseen the passing of the Queen frontman, who died in November 1991.

“This is not just about language. It’s about dignity and respect for the people of Karnataka. An officer of a public sector bank refusing to speak Kannada is unacceptable.”

“Is this a bank in Karnataka or Delhi? Why is Hindi being imposed on us in our own state?”

SBI’s response: Apology and transfer of officer

“If I have hurt anyone, I sincerely apologise. I will try to conduct business in Kannada going forward.”

Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s statement

“The behaviour of the SBI Branch Manager in Surya Nagara, Anekal Taluk, refusing to speak in Kannada and English and showing disregard to citizens is strongly condemnable.”

“Such incidents must not recur. All bank employees must treat customers with dignity and make every effort to speak in the local language. I urge the Finance Ministry and the Department of Financial Services to mandate cultural and language sensitisation training for all bank staff across India,”

“Respecting local language is respecting the people.”

A language-related controversy has ignited widespread debate in Karnataka after a State Bank of India (SBI) official was seen in a viral video refusing to communicate in Kannada with a customer. The incident, which took place at the SBI Surya Nagar branch in Anekal Taluk, has drawn criticism from local citizens, social media users, and political leaders alike. The video depicts a customer requesting the official to speak Kannada, the state’s official language, only to be met with a defiant response from the staffer who insisted on speaking Hindi. The confrontation, which quickly went viral, has reignited discussions about linguistic respect, official communication in public institutions, and cultural sensitivity within India’s federal framework.The incident also drew a swift response from Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and prompted a broader conversation about the role of language in public service delivery in multilingual India. While the bank has since transferred the official and issued an apology video, the matter continues to stir strong emotions online and offline, reflecting deeper concerns around language imposition and regional identity.The controversy began with a video filmed inside the Surya Nagar SBI branch, where a woman officer is seen dismissing a customer's repeated requests to conduct the conversation in Kannada. The customer is heard stating, “This is Karnataka, madam,” to which the staffer retorts, “This is India.” When urged again to use the local language, she responds sharply: “I will not speak Kannada for you… I will speak Hindi,” before walking away with the statement, “I will never speak Kannada.”The video, recorded by another customer, rapidly spread on social media platforms, triggering immediate backlash. Users accused the officer of disrespecting Karnataka’s official language, violating basic customer service norms, and breaching RBI-mandated linguistic guidelines for public-facing roles in banks.As the video gained traction, hashtags such asandbegan trending on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Facebook. Thousands of users tagged SBI, the Union Finance Ministry, and the Reserve Bank of India, demanding disciplinary action against the employee.One user wrote,Another post read,Numerous citizens also highlighted that RBI regulations encourage bank staff to communicate in regional languages to ensure accessibility and respectful service, especially in public-sector institutions.In response to the escalating controversy, the State Bank of India took prompt administrative action. The officer in question was transferred out of the Surya Nagar branch, and a follow-up video was released by the bank.In the video, the staffer—visibly accompanied by a Kannada-speaking colleague—issues an apology in Kannada. She says,While some appreciated the apology, others questioned its authenticity, suggesting it was prompted only after the incident went viral.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah took a strong stance on the issue, releasing a public statement via social media platform X. He condemned the SBI officer’s conduct, stating:The Chief Minister acknowledged the bank’s move to transfer the official but stressed the need for systemic changes to avoid similar incidents in the future.he added.His post concluded with the statement:","Viral video captures confrontation at SBI Branch in Bengaluru.

As one of the few women in the Bandaya Sahitya movement, how did that shape your voice?





HASSAN: Writer Banu Mushtaq scripted history Wednesday, becoming the first Kannada author to win the International Booker Prize Her short-story collection, Heart Lamp , translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, is also the first anthology to receive the prestigious award.Mushtaq, a long-time voice of resistance in Kannada literature and an early participant in the Bandaya Sahitya (a radical forum of writers) movement which began in 1970s, said the international recognition affirmed both literary strength of the Kannada language and the universal relevance of its stories.She described the award-winning moment as ""a thousand fireflies lighting up a single sky"" and reflected on the significance of the award, literary journey, and the power of storytelling to spark social change. Excerpts:Moments before the announcement were tense, unforgettable. When author Max Porter announced Heart Lamp as the winner, an electrifying atmosphere took over. Everyone stood up and began congratulating me, including my relatives who were present. It felt like a thousand fireflies lighting up a single sky. I was, indeed, thrilled.I never imagined stories from my corner of the world would travel this far. This is a moment for all regional-language writers in India.This is also a victory for diversity. The award recognises countless women, whose lives echo through these stories. I'm grateful to Deepa Bhasthi for giving my words a ""new lease of life"" through translation.As a critical insider, I've faced ostracism, threats, and trauma. I believe a writer's task is to document injustices artistically — exposing misuse of power, political manipulation, and women's struggles — without preaching. In today's divided world, with increasing policing of women and hate-driven politics, I remain hopeful. History shows oppressive regimes fall, and despite challenges, change is inevitable.Short stories often receive less attention than novels, but I love the form. Every literary form has its place. It's unfair to rank novels above short stories or create a hierarchy between them.T his prize demonstrates the true potential of the Kannada language and its literature. If more Kannada works are translated into English and other languages, we can introduce our stories to a global audience. This story is a love letter to my belief that no tale is ever just local. A story born under a banyan tree in my village can cast its shadow across the world.The English version of the collection is based on my anthology in Kannada — Edeya Hanate (Heart Lamp). The material comes from life itself. I observe people and society. I also gather compelling human stories from newspapers. As an advocate and mediator, I often provide legal counsel for free, especially for women. During consultations, they not only share their legal issues but also their emotional struggles. I maintain two sets of notes — one for the case, and the other for their personal narratives. These emotional experiences become the foundation for my stories. I empathise with their pain, and that shapes my creative expression.The selection was collaborative. Deepa read five of my anthologies and selected stories that moved her. I suggested a few as well. She would say, ‘I love this story for this reason'. I respected her choices because if she was so deeply impacted, others, too, would be. The emotions in these stories are universal. Women from India to Japan to France face similar control and subjugation. When they read these stories, they recognise themselves. That is the very essence of this collection.Bandaya is not just a movement — it's a state of mind. It represents resistance against injustice. Society, sometimes, imposes harsh rules and demands that individuals conform. At such times, we must confront it. I question society, politics, religion, and patriarchy. Bandaya remains relevant today as a mindset and a way of life.Let me share a story. A Muslim woman from the coast visited me recently. She told me about her suffering and said she didn't know what to do next. I asked her why she came to me when there are so many advocates in Hassan. She said she had watched ‘Hasina', a film that won three national awards, based on my story. Decades later, she rewatched it, and it gave her answers. She said, ""I thought you were the right person to help me."" That's when I felt my writing had made a difference.The 1970s saw the rise of Bandaya movement in Hassan, a hub of activism in women's rights, Dalit literature, and the unique concept of Muslim Sahitya Samvedane in Kannada. This movement sparked widespread protests and social change across Karnataka and India, influencing politics and literature. As a journalist in Hassan, I witnessed daily demonstrations and the efforts of senior leaders firsthand. These experiences shaped my perspective and writing. My reflections on these hardships inspired much of my literary work.","Banu Mushtaq is the first Kannada author to win the International Booker Prize.

NEW DELHI: Health authorities are closely monitoring a rise in Covid-19 cases across multiple states, amid a resurgence of infections in parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore.While overall case numbers remain low compared to previous waves, cities such as Mumbai, Chennai and Ahmedabad have reported small but notable surge in infections.Mumbai has reported 95 new Covid-19 cases in May — a significant increase compared to the state’s total of 106 since January, according to the Maharashtra health department.At least 16 people are currently hospitalised, with most being shifted from KEM Hospital to Seven Hills Hospital to curb potential transmission.Authorities are testing all patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) for Covid-19.In Pune, municipal officials have reserved 50 beds at Naidu Hospital as a precautionary measure. The city currently has no active Covid-19 patients in public hospitals.“We had only one patient in May — an 87-year-old from Manjari — who has since fully recovered,” said Dr Nina Borade, health chief at Pune Municipal Corporation.She added that tests are currently not being conducted in civic hospitals and said the city is awaiting updated central guidelines.In Tamil Nadu, 12 new Covid-19 cases have been reported in Puducherry. In Chennai, doctors are reporting a shift: fevers previously attributed to influenza are now increasingly being linked to Covid-19.Surgeons in some hospitals have delayed critical procedures, including organ transplants and heart surgeries, due to the risk of infection.“We are seeing a rising share of Covid-19 among viral cases,” said Dr Subramaniam Swaminathan, an infectious diseases expert at Gleneagles Healthcity. “Two weeks ago, 60% of our positive samples were influenza A or B. Now, it’s Covid-19.”Public health director Dr T S Selvavinayagam said there is no need for panic but urged caution in crowded spaces. “Covid-19 never truly disappeared — it has been circulating at low levels with seasonal peaks,” he said.Karnataka has confirmed 16 active Covid-19 cases, according to state health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao.In Gujarat, seven new cases were detected in Ahmedabad on a single day — an unusual spike in a city that has averaged just one case per month over the past year. All seven patients are in home isolation, and authorities have sent their samples for genomic testing.Although the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over in May 2023, Covid-19 continues to circulate globally.

NEW DELHI: Former Infosys director Mohandas Pai criticised a State Bank of India (SBI) branch manager in Karnataka after she refused to communicate in Kannada with a local customer.Pai described the manager’s behaviour as “very, very wrong” and emphasised that businesses must serve customers in a language they understand.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Pai wrote: “You are very very wrong. Every business must serve its local customers in a language they understand. This is not the British Raj again. This is a service business. Learning say 200 words to converse is difficult? Nobody is asking anyone to read and write but converse, learn a few words to show respect to your customers.”He added, “They are customers not your captives or subjects. Thus arrogance is very very wrong.”The incident occurred at the SBI Suryanagar branch in Chandapura, Anekal taluk.A video circulating on social media showed the branch manager refusing to speak in Kannada despite repeated requests from a customer.The manager insisted she only knew Hindi and said, “Where is it written that I should speak in Kannada? Show me the rules. I will never speak in Kannada. You talk to my SBI chairman.” Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah condemned the manager’s behaviour on X, saying: “The SBI branch manager refusing to speak in Kannada and English and showing disregard to citizens is strongly condemnable.We appreciate SBI’s swift action in transferring the official. The matter may now be treated as closed.”Following the backlash, several Kannada organisations protested demanding strict action against the manager.Police confirmed the incident took place but said no formal complaint had been filed.Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya also criticised the manager’s conduct on social media, saying: “This behaviour by the SBI branch manager is simply unacceptable. If you are doing customer-interface work in Karnataka, especially in a sector like banking, it is important to communicate with customers in the language they know.”","Former Infosys director Mohandas Pai criticised a State Bank of India (SBI) branch manager in Karnataka.

Bill Gates criticised Elon Musk over government cuts



Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates recently accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of ‘killing world’s poorest children’. In an interview to Financial Times, Microsoft founder criticised Elon Musk for killing the poor children by shutting down the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ). Gates also highlighted that Elon Musk’s decision to cut down foreign aid funding could lead to increase in the cases of measles, HIV, and polio and more. “The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates told the Financial Times. Now the Tesla CEO has responded to Gates statement. During the Qatar Economic Forum, Elon Musk dismissed all these allegations as false and also called Gates a ‘huge lair’.Now, Elon Musk has fired back at Bill Gates during an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. Musk has publicly dismissed Gates' claims as false. In a notable retort, Musk reportedly questioned Gates' suitability for childcare, implying a lack of trust in his judgment.“Who does Bill Gates think he is to make comments about the welfare of children, given that he was very close with Jeffrey Epstein... I wouldn’t want that guy to babysit my kid,” Musk said.In a recent interview with Financial Times, Microsoft co-founder expressed concerns over Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which oversaw major budget reductions in foreign aid programs. Gates stated that these cuts would result in millions on child deaths and could also lead to reversing of progress in global health .In February 2025, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effectively shut down USAID, calling it “a criminal organisation” and stating it was “time for it to die”. Gates argued that the abrupt cuts have left life-saving food and medicines expiring in warehouses, depriving vulnerable communities of essential aid.Gates has pledged to spend $200 billion on global health and education before winding down his foundation by 2045. Musk, meanwhile, has defended his approach, arguing that government inefficiencies often waste resources and that private sector innovation can drive more impactful solutions.","Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates recently accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of ‘killing world’s poorest children’ Musk has publicly dismissed Gates' claims as false.

Infosys, and other IT companies urge WFH amid orange alert in Bengaluru



Employees express concerns over Bengaluru waterlogging problems



Why WFH was the only viable option in Bengaluru

Employee safety: Roads submerged in knee-deep water and frequent reports of electrocution in water-logged buildings have created serious safety concerns.

Commute times: Employees reported taking over two hours to travel just 7 km, leading to massive productivity loss.

Operational disruptions: Server teams, support staff, and office maintenance crews were unable to access physical facilities, disrupting even hybrid model operations.

Bengaluru is under an alert due to the pre-monsoon wreaking havoc across the city which is famed as IT corridor is once again turning to work-from-home (WFH) as a temporary but necessary measure due to heavy rains. With waterlogged roads, blocked flyovers, and hours-long traffic snarls paralyzing mobility across major tech zones like Electronic City, Outer Ring Road, and Whitefield, companies are left with little choice but to prioritise employee safety and operational continuity. While the IT sector's rapid shift to work-from-home demonstrates its flexibility and resilience, it also exposes the vulnerabilities in Bengaluru’s urban planning and crisis preparedness. Weather-triggered disruptions are becoming more frequent, and unless addressed structurally, remote work may cease to be a strategic advantage and instead become a default survival strategy.For now, WFH offers a temporary reprieve. But in the long run, governments, urban planners, and corporate leaders must work collaboratively to ensure that India’s Silicon Valley doesn't drown under its own weight—quite literally.In a city known as India’s Silicon Valley, where infrastructure is perpetually strained by rapid urban expansion, the current deluge has brought daily operations to a standstill. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Bengaluru and a red alert for Karnataka, predicting continued heavy rainfall and thunderstorms through May 26.This weather pattern, combined with Bengaluru’s notoriously inadequate drainage systems, has left vast swathes of the city waterlogged, rendering commutes both unsafe and impractical. Outer Ring Road, home to dozens of multinational IT and tech firms, was among the worst affected, leading many employers to reissue remote work advisories.Most major IT firms, including Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Accenture, and Cognizant, quickly responded by asking employees to work from home for at least two days, citing both safety concerns and productivity losses due to commuting delays. Notably, Electronic City, a key IT hub, saw temporary road closures, including on the elevated expressway, stranding thousands of tech workers.This sudden pivot to WFH is reminiscent of the early COVID-19 days, but with a different driver—infrastructure failure rather than public health.Employees took to social media to express their frustration. One user, Reshma Nair, posted:“Left Electronic City at 8 AM as flyovers were blocked. Got stuck near Kudlu Gate—buses not moving. 7 km in 2+ hours. Elderly people, office-goers, all stranded. This isn’t the Bengaluru we knew.” Such sentiments underscore a growing concern: while remote work offers relief, Bengaluru’s inability to cope with seasonal weather is becoming a recurring liability for its workforce and companies alike.For IT firms, which often handle critical backend operations for global clients, maintaining continuity is non-negotiable. Having robust WFH infrastructure, such as secure VPNs, cloud-based project management tools, and collaborative platforms, has made this switch relatively smooth for most firms. However, the current events also raise longer-term strategic questions for the sector: Should tech firms invest more in decentralized hubs across smaller cities to reduce dependence on Bengaluru? Can there be a private-public partnership to improve urban infrastructure around major corporate zones? Is remote-first employment becoming more than just a contingency plan?","Bengaluru is under an alert due to the pre-monsoon wreaking havoc across the city.

Who is Indian-Origin executive Vaibhav Taneja? Tesla CFO earns a record $139 million salary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-indian-origin-executive-vaibhav-taneja-tesla-cfo-earns-a-record-139-million-salary/articleshow/121300085.cms,"

Vaibhav Taneja’s journey: From Delhi University to Wall Street

Climbing Tesla’s ranks

The $139 million pay package: Why it stands out

A high salary amid Tesla’s challenges

The man behind the numbers

Vaibhav Taneja , the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Tesla is making global headlines by earning a staggering $139.5 million in total salary for the year 2024. It is one of the highest pay packages ever awarded to a CFO. The bulk of this figure came from stock options and equity awards granted following his promotion, far surpassing his base salary of $400,000. This extraordinary compensation exceeded the earnings of top tech leaders like Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai, placing Taneja in the spotlight as one of the most highly paid finance executives in corporate history. Taneja’s salary is not just a number; it’s a symbol of Tesla’s high-stakes leadership culture.Vaibhav Taneja’s journey began in India. He earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Delhi University in 1999, became a Chartered Accountant through the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India in 2000, and later qualified as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in the U.S. in 2006.He spent nearly 17 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in India and the U.S., where he rose to Senior Manager in Assurance. In 2016, he joined SolarCity, the solar energy firm later acquired by Tesla, marking the beginning of his journey with the electric vehicle giant. From a Delhi classroom to Silicon Valley boardrooms, Taneja’s rise is remarkable.After the SolarCity merger in 2017, Taneja joined Tesla as Assistant Corporate Controller. He quickly moved up the ladder: promoted to Corporate Controller in 2018, appointed Chief Accounting Officer in 2019, and eventually elevated to Chief Financial Officer in August 2023, succeeding Zach Kirkhorn. He now also serves as a director at Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited, playing a key role in Tesla’s Indian expansion strategy. His ascent reflects not just skill, but deep trust from Tesla’s top brass.Taneja’s record-breaking $139.5 million compensation package is largely stock-based and designed to vest over four years. At the time of the award, Tesla shares were valued near $250, but by May 2025, the stock had risen to $342, making the award even more lucrative.His pay eclipsed Satya Nadella's $79.1 million and Sundar Pichai’s $10.7 million in the same year. It also beat the previous CFO compensation record of $86 million set by Nikola’s CFO in 2020. In an era of scrutiny, his pay package has reignited debates over executive compensation. This places Taneja in a unique class of corporate executives.Taneja’s compensation comes as Tesla navigates turbulent waters: declining EV deliveries, shrinking margins, and rising global competition. While critics question such high executive payouts, others argue that rewarding leaders with strong financial stewardship is critical for steering through volatile market conditions.Meanwhile, Elon Musk , Tesla’s CEO, is battling legal challenges related to his own voided $56 billion pay package, further intensifying scrutiny of Tesla’s executive pay structures.Known for his quiet competence rather than flamboyance, Taneja is often described as a steady, strategic leader with deep expertise in financial operations and corporate integration. His success story serves as inspiration for professionals worldwide, especially from the Indian diaspora. In a world chasing charisma, Taneja’s quiet precision is making waves.With over two decades of experience, Taneja now stands at the helm of Tesla’s financial strategy — proving that technical skills, global adaptability, and the ability to navigate complex corporate landscapes can lead to extraordinary success.","Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer of Tesla, earned $139.5 million in total salary for the year 2024.

Akhlaque Azam, India-based logistics personEspionage – possession of confidential documents related to Indian Armed Forces The operation ended with the arrest of Ansarul Miya Ansari, a Pakistani operative tasked with gathering sensitive Indian armed forces data and Akhlaque Azam, an Indian national providing logistical support.The probe uncovered suspicious communications involving staffers at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi, believed to have aided ISI officers Muzammil and Ehsan-ur-Rahim in cultivating Indian influencers for intelligence purposes.The operation began in January with a tip-off about an ISI agent entering Delhi via Nepal to collect classified military documents and coordinates.After intelligence confirmed an imminent attack plan targeting key defence installations—including Palam Air Force base, the CGO Complex, and Delhi Cantonment—authorities laid a trap.On 15 February, Ansari was apprehended in central Delhi carrying sensitive documents, as he attempted to return to Pakistan.Subsequent investigations revealed Azam’s role as a logistics facilitator in India, with intercepted mobile phone conversations indicating a wider conspiracy involving Pakistani handlers. Azam was arrested in March during a coordinated raid.Further interrogation disclosed Ansari’s radicalisation and recruitment by the ISI during a month-long stay in Pakistan in June 2024, where he met high-ranking military officials and received espionage training.The chargesheet filed in May under the Official Secrets Act formally accuses both men of espionage related to possession and attempted transfer of classified military information.With trial proceedings set to begin, the accused remain in Tihar jail’s high-security wing under close watch to prevent any influence over other inmates.Authorities remain vigilant, signalling a firm stance in safeguarding national security from covert threats.","Operation began in January with a tip-off about an ISI agent entering Delhi via Nepal to collect classified military documents and coordinates.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.
