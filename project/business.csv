1-year jail not a prerequisite for bail to accused in laundering case: SC to ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-year-jail-not-a-prerequisite-for-bail-to-accused-in-laundering-case-sc-to-ed/articleshow/121279987.cms,"Release accused within a week, SC directs ED



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said there was no ""rule"" that an accused in a money laundering case had to spend at least a year in jail before being granted bail , and gave relief to one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam who had spent over nine months in custody.As the counsel appearing for the Enforcement Directorate took the stand that bail could not be granted to the accused as he was arrested in Aug last year and had not completed a year behind bars, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said it was not a ""rule"" to be in custody for a year to get bail.The ED counsel said SC had been following the one-year custody ""benchmark"" to grant bail in various cases, including that of former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji, and argued that the yardstick be followed in the case of liquor scam accused Anwar Dhebar 's bail plea too.The bench then asked the ED counsel whether he wanted the accused to spend seven years in jail which is the maximum sentence.The court said trial in the case was not going to wind up in the near future as there were more than 450 witnesses in the predicate offence. The counsel, however, insisted that the accused was a politically connected and influential person and his bail would hamper the trial. The court did not accept his submission and granted Anwar Dhebar bail. It asked the trial court to release the accused within a week on terms and conditions fixed by the special court.SC had said on Jan 17 that in cases where an accused has spent one year in jail and the charges against them in a money laundering case have not yet been framed, they could be considered for bail.The apex court has been granting bail to various accused in money laundering cases after reading down the stringent bail provisions of PMLA by ruling that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds to release accused on bail.

According to an official document, the SOP was recommended by a committee constituted for the adoption and implementation of uniform guidelines to be followed by departments, faculties, and centres during the admission process. The recommendation was duly approved by the vice-chancellor in April last year.In addition to the student's own declaration, the SOP includes a ""Declaration by the Father/Local Guardian of the Student,"" which reads: ""I hereby declare that I take full responsibility of his/her conduct and character as a student of Jamia Millia Islamia. I shall make myself available to the university whenever required.""While undertakings from parents on anti-ragging norms are standard across Indian universities, Jamia's broader clause placing overall responsibility for a student's conduct on the parent or guardian is uncommon.The requirement comes against the backdrop of heightened administrative focus on discipline. In Feb, students held a sit-in protest near the central canteen of the university, demanding the revocation of disciplinary action against their peers. Following this, the university filed a police complaint, and several students later alleged that police officials contacted their parents, asking them to ensure their wards left the protest site.TOI reached out to Jamia media cordinator Saima Saeed for a comment but did not receive any response.

Mango Shipments to US rejected

US authorities have rejected no fewer than 15 mango shipments from India at various airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta, due to documentation irregularities. The exporters faced the choice of either destroying the fruit in the US or sending it back to India. Given the perishable nature of mangoes and the substantial costs involved in return shipping, all exporters opted to dispose of the mango shipments locally.The United States represents India's primary export destination for mangoes, making these incidents particularly significant for the trade relationship.Considering mangoes are perishable and the substantial expenses linked to destruction or re-exportation, traders anticipate losses of around $500,000.The mangoes had undergone the required irradiation process in Mumbai on May 8 and 9. However, according to an ET report US officials found inconsistencies in the documentation related to this mandatory treatment, which involves exposing the fruit to controlled radiation doses to eliminate pests and prolong shelf life. The issue stemmed from administrative errors in the pest-control documentation rather than actual pest presence, the report said. USDA communication to an affected exporter indicated that US Customs and Border Protection refused entry ""due to incorrectly issued PPQ203."" The notice specified that the shipment ""must be re-exported or destroyed,"" whilst clarifying that the US government would not bear costs for ""remedial measures for this shipment.""The irradiation procedure takes place at a facility situated in Navi Mumbai, overseen by a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) representative. This official is tasked with validating the PPQ203 form, which is essential for mango exports to the US. ""We are being penalised for mistakes made at the irradiation facility,"" an exporter said.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right Another exporter, whose consignment was detained at Los Angeles airport during May 9-11, before receiving destruction orders, was notified that the shipment failed to satisfy the ""entry requirement,"" specifically regarding the mandatory irradiation treatment.The exporter firmly denied the allegation, asserting that the irradiation procedure was completed and the PPQ203 form was issued following the treatment. ""How can we receive the form if the treatment was never done? And without that form, issued by none other than the USDA officer, the mangoes couldn't even have been cleared for loading at Mumbai airport,"" he said.When asked about the specifics of the case, including the quantity of affected mangoes and documentation discrepancies, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Authority (APEDA) chairman's office responded, ""The matter pertains to the shipment of mangoes from USDA approved facility, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) located at Vashi, Mumbai. Hence inputs may be sought from them. "" APEDA operates under the ministry of commerce and industry. MSAMB did not provide any response to the email enquiry.Meanwhile, India and US are looking to seal a trade deal soon. US President Donald Trump has claimed that India has offered a deal with 'literally no tariffs'. The first phase of the deal is expected to be completed in the coming months.India aims to enhance two-way trade by seeking tariff reductions from the United States for sectors employing large workforces. These include textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas under the proposed trade agreement.The United States, in return, seeks reduced duties across various sectors including industrial products, automobiles (specifically electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy items, agricultural produce such as apples, and tree nuts.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’","Mango shipments to US rejected at Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta airports.

Karnataka Liquor Shop Closed on May 21: Retailers Protest Against Licence Fee Hike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-liquor-shops-to-shut-on-may-21-over-licence-fee-hike/articleshow/121260867.cms,"Representative image

Experts: Frequent hike will shut more shops

Poll Do you support the liquor shop owners' decision to strike against the recent licence fee hikes? Yes, it's a justified protest No, they should comply with regulations





BENGALURU: Buffeted by repeated hikes in excise duties and licence fees in the past two years, thousands of distilleries and liquor shops in Karnataka are planning a strike and demonstration on May 20 and a complete shutdown of all industry activities on May 21. Store owners are planning to stop purchasing liquor from govt depots as a mark of protest. Karnataka Wine Merchants Association , along with National Restaurant Association of India and Karnataka Brewery and Distilleries Association , took the dual-protest measure after the latest blow came in the form of govt's May 15 draft notification doubling licence fees.Calling fee hikes ""steep and unbearable"", the store owners will shutter down on Wednesday. Of 12,000 licensed liquor stores in Karnataka,over 5,000 are participating in the shutdown.According to the draft notification, the annual licence fee for breweries has increased from Rs 27 lakh to Rs 54 lakh, while for distilleries and warehouses, it has risen from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 90 lakh. The new fees take effect on July 1.Industry representatives told TOI such frequent increases will lead to more business closures and higher prices for consumers. Nearly 30,000 letters of objections have been collected from employees, licensees, customers, vendors, and landlords, highlighting concern over a fourfold increase in fee this year.A senior excise department official said the hikes were implemented to address revenue shortfalls from the previous year. ""The hike was a decision taken by the govt and we just implemented it. The decision is taken to cover the gap for the previous year target,"" the official said.While the revenue target for 2024-25 was set at Rs 38,525 crore, the department managed to collect only Rs 35,530 crore, or 92.3% of the target.Retailers noted the fresh licence fee hikes will particularly affect budget-segment sales and small outlets. More than 40 pubs in Bengaluru closed last year due to rising costs and declining customer numbers.A pub chain owner in Koramangala, said: ""The hikes are eating into all our profits. Earlier, it was AED (additional excise duty) hikes, now even the licence fee is doubled. We might as well shut our businesses. Even in peak summer, there are barely any sales.""Sampath Kumar, vice-president of Karnataka Wine Merchants Association, said: ""We had a meeting on Friday with our committee members. Both consumers and merchants can't bear the expenses.""Ananth Narayana, secretary of National Restaurant Association of India, added: ""We generate so much employment, pay crores in taxes, yet the govt is intent on killing the golden goose. Last time, we saw excise collection dip after taxes increased, and many outlets went into the red. The govt is repeating the mistake.""",Thousands of distilleries and liquor shops in Karnataka are planning a strike and demonstration on May 20 and a complete shutdown of all industry activities on May 21.

'Judges also human': Justice Abhay S Oka admits error in judgment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-also-human-justice-abhay-s-oka-admits-error-in-judgment/articleshow/121277892.cms,"'Even for judges, learning process always continues'

NEW DELHI: Judges are also human and they can make mistakes while judging, Justice Abhay S Oka said Monday while admitting that he committed a mistake in deciding a case as a Bombay HC judge in 2016 relating to interpretation of the Domestic Violence Act and said it was a continuous learning process for judges.While holding that HCs have jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC to quash proceedings of an application filed under Section 12(1) of DV Act, which says an aggrieved woman may approach a magistrate for relief such as payment of compensation, Justice Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench comprising himself and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, said as an HC judge, he had taken a contrary view on the issue.SC said that HCs must keep in mind that DV Act is a welfare legislation specially enacted to give justice to women who suffer from domestic violence.Therefore, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 for quashing proceedings under Section 12(1), the high court should be very slow and circumspect. Interference can be made only when the case is clearly of gross illegality or gross abuse of the process of law, the bench said.Generally, the high court must adopt a hands-off approach while dealing with proceedings under Section 482 for quashing an application under Section 12(1). Unless high courts show restraint... the very object of enacting the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 will be defeated, the bench added.Justice Abhay S Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench, said: ""Before we part with this judgment, we must mention here that one of us (Abhay S Oka) is a party to a judgment dated Oct 27, 2016, of Bombay high court (HC) in writ petition 2473 of 2016 in which the view taken is that remedy under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available for quashing the proceedings under Section 12(1) of DV Act, 2005.""""This view was found to be incorrect by a full bench of the same high court. As judges, we are duty-bound to correct our mistakes in properly constituted proceedings. Even for judges, the learning process always continues,"" he said.""There are decisions of high courts taking a view that the jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC is not available to quash proceedings... under Section 12(1) of Domestic Violence Act. The decisions are primarily based on the premise that the proceedings... predominantly of a civil nature. The said view is not correct for the reasons set out earlier,"" Justice Oka said while correcting the orders of high courts and also correcting his stand taken as an HC judge nine years ago.","Justice Abhay S Oka said it was a continuous learning process for judges.

He said that Nehru not only agreed to give water to Pakistan at the cost of India but also gave Rs 83 crore to the neighbouring country, whose value now amounts to Rs 5,500 crore.Chouhan was referring to the amount that India gave to Pakistan to help build replacement canals from the western rivers of the Indus system.""We had been giving waters to Pakistan at the cost of our farmers' interest, but the neighbouring country has been responsible for producing terrorists,"" said Chouhan, adding that even former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had opposed the Indus Waters Treaty in Parliament.Referring to Nehru's remarks where he reportedly said that India bought peace by extending financial assistance to Pakistan, Chouhan said, ""What kind of peace was that? We lost water as well as money.""Explaining the rationale behind keeping the treaty in abeyance, Chouhan said, ""Waters of Indus river system will now be used for India and its farmers."" Representatives of several organisations, including Samyukta Kisan Morcha and Bharatiya Kisan Union (non-political), attended the meeting. They supported govt's move on the treaty and even demanded that it be abrogated.The farmers’ representatives also demanded the government to work for better utilization of water resources available in the Indus River System for the benefit of farmers in Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh.Under the treaty, waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - are allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - are allocated largely to Pakistan. Though India is permitted to use the water of the western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power, the country has not been fully utilising its legal share.The government has now prepared a detailed roadmap, carrying short, medium and long-term plans, to enhance the country’s water storage capacity, speed up completing under construction hydro-power projects on priority and use of existing Ranbir and Pratap canals to ensure more water for Jammu region.","Govt has started rallying public opinion against the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), the suspension of which by India following the Pahalgam terror attack has been termed by Pakistan ""an act of war"" Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday met farmers organisations and explained to them how the then PM Jawaharlal Nehru signed the treaty.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121279583,imgsize-41586,width-400,resizemode-4/Shivraj-Singh-Chouhan.jpg"

When the film opened at Bombay's Royal Opera House on Dec 5, 1969, editor Waman Bhonsle and Bhatt were at the theatre.Biographer Amborish Roychoudhury writes in the book, ""A manager by the name of Desai, came to Bhatt and Bhonsle and said, ""Saamne woh Shakti ki picture chal rahi hai 'Aradhana', woh advance mein housefull hai. Yahan par log nahin aate. Picture doobegi."" (Shakti's film 'Aradhana', playing across the road, is running to full house in advance booking. No one is coming here. This film will flop.)""When he heard this, Bhatt broke down. Bhonsle had seen it all before, but the young Bhatt, all of 20, was emotionally attached to the film,"" says the book, co-authored by Anita Khosla and Uma Khosla Kapur, both director's daughters.The book titled, ""Raj Khosla: The Authorized Biography,"" also says that the film originally ended with some ""touching lines about mother-son relationship"" which wasn't working too well with the audience.Khosla reached out to heroine Sadhana, with whom he had worked in four films. ""Over the years, she had become a confidante and a sounding board. He showed her his films, and she told him what she felt,"" writes Roychoudhury.Sadhana suggested ending the film with a clip of the track, 'Bindiya Chamkegi', which was to become radio countdown show, Binaca Geetmala's No 1 song of 1971. Khosla carried out the change.'Do Raaste' ""ran for more than 50 weeks at the same Opera House where the staff had written the film off."" Debtors were paid. Khosla announced a bonus for some staff members. Bhatt's bonus was Rs 300, equivalent to a month's wage. ""He gave me 300 bucks extra to me for shedding tears!,"" the biography quotes Bhatt as saying. Khosla passed away in 1991. In the foreword, Bhatt describes him as ""My mentor. My master.""","Khosla had already delivered superhits in a variety of genres: thriller 'CID' (1956), suspenseful 'Woh Kaun Thi?'

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court dismissed on Monday the Sambhal Shahi Jama Masjid committee's petition challenging a Nov 19, 2024 trial court order directing an advocate commissioner to survey the structure, the subject of a suit claiming that the mosque was built in 1526 after demolishing a temple, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey.While upholding the trial court's survey order, Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal vacated the interim stay on the Hindu plaintiffs ' suit. The mosque committee had asked for the suit to be dismissed on the ground that the Hindu side's claim to the site was prima facie barred under the Places of Worship Act, 1991. The legislation prohibits conversion of any place of worship and mandates maintaining the religious character of any such site that existed on Aug 15, 1947.This is not a case where any conversion of place of worship is taking place or the religious character is being changed. The plaintiffs have only sought right to access to a protected monument, declared in 1920 under Section 18 of Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, the 45-page judgment states. In its petition, the mosque committee contended that the civil judge (junior division) ordered the survey ""hastily"" and ""without issuing notice"". Based on the Nov 19 directive, a survey was conducted that very day and another one on Nov 24.Later that month, SC stayed proceedings in the trial court until the mosque committee's petition against the survey order was heard by an HC bench.Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said in its submission to the bench that the mosque had been designated as a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act , 1958. This effectively means that its status is governed by preservation laws rather than religious classification. ASI also mentioned that nowhere in official records was the mosque described as a religious place.The Hindu plaintiffs contend that the disputed Sambhal mosque stands at what used to be site of an ancient Harihar temple dedicated to Kalki, last avatar of Vishnu. The suit claims in 1526, on orders of Mughal emperor Babar, the temple was partially demolished and a mosque built over it.","Allahabad high court dismisses Sambhal Shahi Jama Masjid committee's petition challenging a Nov 19, 2024 trial court order directing an advocate commissioner to survey the structure.

Govt to Delhi high court: Turkish company's security clearance pulled on intel inputs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-delhi-high-court-turkish-companys-security-clearance-pulled-on-intel-inputs/articleshow/121278696.cms,"Delhi HC

Civil aviation & national security intertwined, SG Mehta tells HC

NEW DELHI: Better to be safe than sorry, the Delhi high court remarked Monday while hearing a plea by Turkish firm Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd against revocation of its security clearance by the central govt. Opposing the plea, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the decision was taken in the interest of national security following certain intelligence inputs that it would be ""hazardous"" to permit the company to continue ground handling operations at nine airports in the country.The senior law officer shared the inputs with the court in a sealed cover, telling Justice Sachin Datta that disclosing them would be counterproductive and affect national interest and security.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Celebi, said the company has been operating in India for 17 years and had 14,000 employees.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued civil aviation and national security are interdependent. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi contended Centre acted ""because of public perception due to shareholding of the company by Turkish nationals"" but pointed out that it is ""an Indian company with Indian employees"", adding ""we are not a rogue company"". The security clearance, he said, was revoked without any opportunity for a hearing or reason.""The enemy can try 10 times and succeed once; the country has to succeed all the time... in cases of civil aviation and national security, there cannot be a doctrine of proportionality,"" Mehta countered. He said airport handling and cargo handling are ""extremely sensitive operations: where personnel know and have access to ""every nook and cranny of the airport"".Mehta said the case involved passenger and cargo handling contracts, noting intelligence inputs indicate that, given the prevailing security climate, allowing Celebi to continue operating poses significant risks. Rohatgi, however, insisted that govt must provide concrete evidence to substantiate its allegations, adding Celebi's airport ground handling operations in India are independent and professionally managed.Justice Datta wondered if such a decision is even amenable to being heard in appeal by the court and if serving a prior notice was mandatory under such conditions, before posting the matter for further hearing on May 21. The security clearance of the firms was revoked by BCAS days after Turkiye backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country.","Solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued civil aviation and national security are interdependent.

Indian-origin Howard University professor says H-1B visas have no connection to US worker shortage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-howard-university-professor-says-h-1b-visas-have-no-connection-to-us-worker-shortage/articleshow/121276348.cms,"Howard professor Ron Hira weighed in on the recent H-1B uproar.





Howard University professor Ron Hira said H-1B visa programs that allow US companies to hire skilled labour from outside the country have no connection to merit or shortage of US workers for those specific jobs. Ron Hira, whose parents were Indians and came to the US on similar visas has long been a critic of the H-1b visa programs as he argued that companies misuse these programs to outsource cheaper employees instead of giving work to US graduates. In 2016, he gave a testimony in the Senate on immigration and detailed that both his parents were from India and his wife is an India-born. And hence to testify against this visa program was very meaningful to him personally.Amid the ongoing H-1B row, triggered by the release of the latest H-1B figures of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Roh Hira said that H-1B workers get selected by a random lottery and not the best and brightest. The USCIS revealed that the administration selected 120,141 H-1B visa applications for 2026, which is the lowest since 2021, but US tech workers claim that the number is huge given the massive layoffs that are happening in companies.USCIS makes selections by lottery every year when the agency receives more H-1B electronic registrations than permitted. The annual H-1B limit is 65,000 plus a 20,000 exemption for individuals with an advanced degree from a US university.The H-1B figures for 2026 have puzzled MAGA, as they expected a crackdown on H-1B from the Donald Trump administration. During the major H-1B row that involved Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy supporting the program, President Donald Trump said he was in favor of H-1B, though he has taken a stern stance on illegal immigration.Republican leader Virgil Bierschwale questioned whether the 2026 H-1B figures reveal that the employers have already chosen the employees they will fire as no new jobs are being created.""This 2026 visa approval gets me. Over a year ahead of the current date, they already have approved visas. And they must have a job to have a visa. Which means the employer has already picked out the employee they plan on firing since they are not creating new jobs. How is this not fraud at every level?"" Bierschwale wrote.""A huge chunk of H-1B petitions are for jobs that don’t even exist. Indian IT body shops are notorious for hoarding H-1B workers, hoping to lease them out later. If there’s no client, they get “benched”—which is illegal. But exploiting desperate migrants is a business model too profitable to quit,"" X handle US Tech Workers wrote.","Howard University professor Ron Hira said H-1B visa programs that allow US companies to hire skilled labour from outside the country have no connection to merit or shortage of US workers for those specific jobs.

Here’s what Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath wrote on X (formerly Twitter)

""Here's something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.""

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

Poll Do you believe increasing soft drink consumption is a significant health risk for India? No, I don't think so Yes, it's a serious concern

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India. In the post, Kamath cited a worrying trend from a beverage maker’s recent earnings. “Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever,” he wrote without naming the beverage company. Kamath linked the increased consumption of soft drinks to a broader health issue, pointing out that “India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic”. Notably, this is the second time when Kamath has warned against rising cases of diabetes in the country. He previously shared a post in November last year, calling Diabetes 'a ticking time bomb for India.'Kamath quoted his previous post which he shared in November last year. He then wrote:","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India.

Who all is the Permanent Ban warning for



How long you can stay in the US does not depend on your visa expiry

US Embassy in India has issued a Permanent Ban warning on travelling to the United States. The American embassy's warning comes via a social media post on Twitter (now X) from the embassy's official account, 'US Embassy in India'. This is the third Twitter post regarding illegal immigration made by the 'US embassy in India' this month so far. It is not clear what exactly is the reason behind these special and frequent warning messages. In a new policy change under the Trump government, all foreign nationals staying in the US for over 30 days are required to register with the Federal government. Failing to do so, may not only result in deportation but also Visa cancellation and more.The latest warning from the American embassy reads:Earlier this month in another post from the US Embassy in India handle reads, ""The U.S. government has launched a coordinated interagency effort to combat fraud and end illegal immigration. Those found guilty of visa fraud will face permanent bans from entering the United States. New visa restriction policies apply to individuals and foreign governments who facilitate illegal immigration.""Not directly linked to Indians travelling to America, but another post on illegal immigration was shared by the embassy in May beginning. ""The United States is working to reduce border threats at home and abroad in partnership with outmigration and transit countries. We also thank our partners for supporting U.S. efforts to deter illegal immigration by facilitating the return of deportees,"" the post read.This warning/advisory is applicable to all the Indian citizens who are traveling to America on their various time-bound visas like work visas, student visas, tourist visas etc. All these visas have their own authorised period of stay. The advisory is aimed as a reminder for travellers to the US on various non-immigrant visas to strictly adhere to the validity period granted at the time they enter the US by the Immigration authorities. The American embassy highlighted that even a brief overstay can carry serious legal consequences.Remember, the visa expiration date shown on your visa does not reflect how long you are authorised to stay within the United States. A ten-year US visa does not mean you can stay in America for 10 years. Entry and the length of authorised stay within the United States are determined by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer at the port-of-entry each time you travel.",US Embassy in India has issued a Permanent Ban warning on travelling to the United States.

Apple is all set to host its annual developer conference — WWDC 2025 next month. At the upcoming event Apple is expected Apple will host its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) from June 9 to 13, 2025, with the keynote taking place on June 9 at Apple Park, followed by developer sessions for the rest of the week. This year, Apple is expected to introduce the redesigned iterations of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, marking the most substantial visual overhaul since iOS 7. Now a new report suggests that significant upgrades to Siri are unlikely to be a central topic at WWDC this year. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reveals that this year Apple is expected to bring major software updates to iOS 19, but significant Siri upgrades may not be a focal point. In a long report, Gurman suggests that Apple is unlikely to discuss much about Siri’s future, despite previous promises of AI-driven enhancements.The report suggests that Apple was somewhat unprepared for the rapid emergence of generative AI, and that internal reluctance to invest heavily in AI development has led to Siri falling behind.

This hesitation contributed to delays in Siri’s evolution, leaving Apple trailing behind competitors like Google Assistant and ChatGPT.“Other leaders shared Federighi’s reservations. “In the world of AI, you really don’t know what the product is until you’ve done the investment,” another longtime executive says. “That’s not how Apple is wired. Apple sits down to build a product knowing what the endgame is,” said Gurman in his report.While Apple has been working on a new AI-powered Siri infrastructure, dubbed LLM Siri, the company is reportedly separating Siri from its broader Apple Intelligence branding due to the assistant’s poor reputation. The goal is to rebuild Siri’s capabilities while managing public expectations.","Apple is expected to host its annual developer conference from June 9 to 13, 2025.

How do I stay motivated through setbacks?

Wish I had a killer answer. But honestly… I don’t 🤷🏻‍♂️

There’s no life hack. No 5 AM routine that magically keeps it all together.

Most days, I just figure it out (like everyone else) - Trial. Error. Repeat.

What’s helped me, though?

I move 🏃

Gym, walk, yoga, squats in the middle of a stressful call - whatever keeps my head from spiraling. And I meditate so that I do not lose it by 11 AM 😅

But I also think the everyday fighting spirit comes from more than just that physical movement...

It comes by remembering that the purpose is bigger than the pain 🎯

That the short-term dip is just that - short-term. And the long-term version of you deserves that extra rep, that small reset, that one more push.

For me, that reminder has carried me through the fog on more days than I can count.

PS - If you’ve figured out the formula, do share it. I’d love to know 💪

Shark Tank India judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal recently shared his perspective on how to stay motivated when facing setbacks.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"

DAKAR: A special court in Senegal on Monday formally charged a former government minister with embezzling Covid funds, a source close to the case told AFP.Salimata Diop, who was the minister for women under ex-president Macky Sall, is one of five former ministers facing allegation of corruption including the misuse of funds intended to fight the pandemic.Diop was charged with complicity in embezzlement and released after paying bail of about $97,750, the source said, confirming local media reports.Her parliamentary immunity from prosecution had been lifted on May 2 to allow the proceedings to go ahead.Diop is under investigation alongside the former ministers for community development, mines, industrial development and justice.Former minister for community development Amadou Mansour Faye is accused of diverting about $4.5 million from a fund set up to fight the Covid-19 pandemic in the west African nation in 2020-21, according to a national assembly report.Senegal's national assembly had earlier this month voted to order a special court to investigate the five former ministers.President Bassirou Diomaye Faye won an election last year vowing to crack down on corruption, particularly by the previous administration under Sall.Senegal's opposition has called the case a ""witchhunt"".","Salimata Diop was the minister for women under ex-president Macky Sall.

Who is Ryo Tatsuki – Japan’s ‘New Baba Vanga’

New Baba Vanga’s prediction for July 2025

Tourism hit as ‘New Baba Vanga’ warning triggers mass cancellations

Official warnings and government response

Social media buzz and public reaction





A Japanese manga artist known for her unsettlingly accurate predictions has sparked widespread concern, leading to a surge in travel cancellations to Japan. Ryo Tatsuki , often referred to as Japan's ""New Baba Vanga,"" has captured global attention for her chilling forecasts, including a major disaster anticipated for July 2025. With a track record that reportedly includes predictions of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the death of iconic figures, Tatsuki’s latest prophecy has left travelers reconsidering their plans.The impact of her warning is already being felt in the travel industry, with agencies reporting significant drops in bookings as the feared date approaches. Here, you can explore Tatsuki's predictions, her history of accurate foresight, and the response from concerned travelers.Ryo Tatsuki is a Japanese manga artist whose prophetic claims have drawn comparisons to the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, known for her eerily accurate predictions about global events. Tatsuki first gained attention in 1999 with the release of her book ""The Future I Saw,"" a compilation of visions she claims to have experienced over the years. While the book initially received little mainstream attention, several of Tatsuki’s predictions have reportedly come true, earning her a devoted following in Japan and beyond.Among her most notable forecasts is the catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan’s northern Tohoku region. This disaster, which claimed over 18,000 lives and triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis, occurred in the same month and year Tatsuki had predicted. Her book also allegedly foresaw the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the death of legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, adding to her reputation as a modern-day seer.In a revised edition of ""The Future I Saw,"" published in 2021, Tatsuki issued a stark warning about a potentially catastrophic event set to strike in July 2025. According to CNN and other media reports, Tatsuki’s prophecy describes a massive undersea rupture forming between Japan and the Philippines, capable of generating tsunamis three times the height of those seen during the 2011 Tohoku disaster.Her prediction includes unsettling imagery of Japan’s oceans “boiling,” which some interpret as a possible reference to an underwater volcanic eruption or a massive seismic event. The epicenter of this anticipated disaster is drawn as a diamond-shaped region connecting Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands – a part of the Pacific known for its intense geological activity.Reports indicate that Tatsuki’s prophecy has already started to influence travel behavior, particularly among tourists planning to visit Japan in the coming months. According to Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, bookings to Japan dropped by as much as 50 percent during the recent Easter break, a trend expected to continue as the feared date draws closer.Speaking to CNN, CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, noted that concerns over Tatsuki’s prediction have been compounded by recent advisories from the Chinese embassy in Tokyo. In a statement issued in April 2025, the embassy warned Chinese nationals in Japan to remain vigilant against potential natural disasters, further fueling anxiety among travelers.The Chinese government’s warning was reportedly prompted by a series of recent seismic events and increased volcanic activity around Japan’s coastline. The South China Morning Post reported that the advisory urged residents and tourists to “take extra precautions against natural disasters,” a statement that many interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment of the growing fears surrounding Tatsuki’s prediction.Japanese authorities, however, have been more reserved in their response, focusing on reassuring the public about the country’s extensive disaster preparedness infrastructure. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has not issued any specific alerts related to the July 2025 timeframe, emphasizing that its seismic monitoring systems remain among the most advanced in the world.Social media platforms have become hotbeds of speculation and debate, with the hashtag #July2025Prediction trending across multiple countries. Some users have expressed deep concern, while others have dismissed the claims as mere coincidence or sensationalism. Online forums dedicated to earthquake preparedness have also seen a surge in activity, with members sharing safety tips and evacuation plans in case of a worst-case scenario.","Ryo Tatsuki, often referred to as Japan's ""New Baba Vanga,"" has predicted a major disaster for July 2025.

New Orleans jailbreak: Sheriff says she complained about cell locks 'at every turn',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-orleans-jailbreak-sheriff-says-she-complained-about-cell-locks-at-every-turn/articleshow/121279391.cms,"Sheriff Susan Hutson





While four of the 10 inmates who broke out of a New Orleans prison have been caught, officials continue to investigate who or what was to blame in a jailbreak which even the escapees labelled as “easy” — in a message scrawled on a wall above the narrow hole they managed to squeeze through.Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she has been raising concerns about Orleans Justice Center 's ongoing “deficiencies."" The jailbreak, Hutson added, has “once again highlighted the critical need for repairs and upgrades” to the ailing infrastructure.""Since becoming sheriff in 2022, I have complained about the locks at every turn and advocated for additional funding to make the facility more secure,"" news agency AP quoted the sheriff as saying.Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill, too, said some cell unit doors and locks have been “manipulated"" to the point that they can't even be closed properly.Four days before the men escaped, Jeworski “Jay” Mallet, chief of corrections for the jail, had presented a need for a new lock system during the city's Capital Improvement Plan hearing.However, there are other crucial elements which officials have outlined. For instance, indications the escape was an ""inside job""; the hole which officials suggest may have been formed using power tools; a lack of monitoring of the cell pod; and law enforcement ""not being aware"" of the jailbreak until seven hours after the men fled.Meanwhile, others have pointed to Sheriff Hutson being at fault.“Rather than take accountability, she’s pointed fingers elsewhere,” Louisana representative Aimee Adatto Freeman, who represents much of the uptown area of New Orleans, said Monday as she called for the sheriff to step down.Early last Friday, 10 men being held at the Orleans Justice Center — many awaiting trials or sentencing for violent charges, including murder — broke open a cell door, slipped through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed wire fence and fled into the dark.The fourth and most recent arrest came late Monday, when 21-year-old Gary Price was taken into custody.","Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson said she has been raising concerns about Orleans Justice Center's ongoing ""deficiencies"" The jailbreak, Hutson added, has “once again highlighted the critical need for repairs and upgrades”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121279408,imgsize-1219108,width-400,resizemode-4/121279408.jpg"
US former President Joe Biden diagnosed with Gleason score 9 prostate cancer. What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-former-president-joe-biden-diagnosed-with-gleason-score-9-prostate-cancer-what-it-means/articleshow/121278989.cms,"US President Joe Biden (File Image)

What is Gleason score?



How Gleason score determined?







US former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an ""aggressive form"" of prostate cancer that has metastasised to the bone, as announced by a spokesperson on May 18. The diagnosis was confirmed two days prior to the public announcement.The spokesperson revealed that Biden's cancer has been classified with a Gleason score of 9, Grade Group 5. This classification requires detailed explanation for better understanding.On Biden's health, US President Donald Trump was surprised and called the news ""very sad, actually.""""I'm surprised that … you know, the public wasn't notified a long time ago because to get to stage nine (sic), that's a long time,"" Trump said on Monday while talking to reporters. Here Trump referred stage nine to Gleason score.The Gleason scoring system, utilised for prostate cancer grading, spans from 6 to 10, as explained by the Cleveland Clinic. Lower scores indicate slower growth patterns, whilst higher scores suggest more aggressive development, US Today reported.The grading system incorporates five distinct groups, with Grade Group 1 indicating slow progression and Grade Group 5 suggesting rapid growth and spread.Biden's diagnosis of Gleason score 9, Grade Group 5, indicates significant cellular differences from healthy tissue.The scoring process involves examining cancer cell patterns. Medical professionals assign grades from 1 to 5 based on how closely the cells resemble normal prostate tissue. The final score combines the grades of the two most prevalent patterns observed.Diagnostic scoring relies on prostate biopsy or surgical results. The Cleveland Clinic emphasises that higher scores primarily guide treatment decisions rather than definitively indicating outcomes.The Mayo Clinic notes that prostate cancer typically presents early and progresses slowly. Statistical data from the American Cancer Society suggests most diagnosed men survive the condition.Projections for 2025 indicate approximately 313,780 new prostate cancer cases and 35,770 related deaths. Statistics show that one in eight men receive this diagnosis, whilst one in 44 succumb to it.Early symptoms may include urinary changes, whilst advanced cases might present with bone pain, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. Medical consultation is advised for anyone experiencing concerning symptoms.","US former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an ""aggressive form"" of prostate cancer.

"Newark airport hit by fourth air traffic control outage since April, FAA confirms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/newark-airport-hit-by-fourth-air-traffic-control-outage-since-april-faa-confirms/articleshow/121278575.cms,"Representative Image





The Newark Liberty International Airport was hit by another air traffic control outage on Monday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) said.According to the FAA, the Philadelphia air traffic control centre, which manages flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, experienced a brief radio system failure for two seconds.This marks the fourth such disruption at Newark Airport since April 28, amidst ongoing technical and personnel challenges. Following the April incident, a 90-second communication interruption occurred on May 9, causing flight disruptions . Another outage on May 11 halted flights, while staff shortages related to the April incident caused extensive delays, CBS News reported.The Philadelphia facility controlling Newark flights currently faces understaffing issues. These issues highlight the critical shortage of air traffic controllers across the United States.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced this month that modernisation of the national air traffic control system is in progress. The upgrade includes new software and equipment installations, with costs expected to reach ""tens of billions of dollars,"" according to Duffy.The current system operates on outdated technology, forcing the FAA to source replacement parts from eBay or create them using 3D printers due to unavailability of new components, as Duffy informed a Senate Appropriations subcommittee in April.Due to ongoing issues at ERW, the FAA suggests implementing significant flight restrictions, limiting arrivals to 28 per hour.The proposed reduction in air traffic would enable the airport to undertake runway construction and improvements. The daily maintenance work is scheduled to continue until June 15, followed by weekly Saturday operations through to year-end.","The Philadelphia air traffic control centre, which manages flights at Newark Liberty International Airport, experienced a brief radio system failure for two seconds.
