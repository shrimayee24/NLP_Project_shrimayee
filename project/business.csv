NEW DELHI: At least 18 people died, including 14 women and three children and over a dozen sustained injuries in a stampede that occurred on Saturday night at the New Delhi Railway station. The incident occurred after a massive surge in passengers heading to Maha Kumbh and those waiting for the trains that had got delayed.A two-member high-level committee has been formed to investigate the matter and determine the cause of the stampede, executive director of information & publicity at the Railway Board, Dilip Kumar said.This comes after the recent stampede at Maha Kumbh due to sudden surge in devotees on Mauni Amavasya that led to the death of 30.The authorities have said that the ""unprecedented"" rush of passengers at two platforms- 13 and 14- led to chaos and panic ultimately causing the stampede.In an official statement, the deputy commissioner of police (railway) reported that platform number 14 was already heavily crowded as the Prayagraj Express awaited departure. Additionally, delays in the Swatantra Senani Express and Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani Express led to an increased passenger presence on platforms 12, 13, and 14, further contributing to the congestion.""As per CMI, every hour 1,500 general tickets were sold by railways due to which the station got overcrowded and became uncontrollable. There was a stampede at platform no. 14 and near escalator near platform no. 16,"" the DCP said.DCP KPS Malhotra elaborated that the crowd surged within 15-20 minutes after the announcement of a special train, as passengers hurried to board. ""Two trains were delayed, and due to the increased footfall, the crowd grew massive. A few people sustained injuries. As of now, the situation is under control,"" he had said.An eyewitness recalled similar situation and said, ""The stampede broke out around 9.30pm... When people on platform number 13 saw trains on platforms 14 and 15 - they moved towards these platforms. The platforms of the trains were not changed, but the crowd was so huge that it could not be controlled....""One of the passengers, Dharmendra Singh, recounted his experience, stating that he was traveling to Prayagraj but faced difficulties as many trains were either delayed or canceled. ""I was going to Prayagraj but many trains were running late or were cancelled. The station was overcrowded. There were far more people than I have ever seen at this station. In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers.""Likewise, the railway ministry said, ""An Unprecedented rush situation developed today at about 10 pm in New Delhi railway station near platforms 13 & 14. Some of the passengers present there on the platforms fainted due to this sudden rush further leading to the rumours of stampede like situation. This led to the spread of panic.""The railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has ordered a high level inquiry into the incident.","At least 18 people died, including 14 women and three children and over a dozen sustained injuries in a stampede that occurred on Saturday night at the New Delhi Railway station.

Mucherla organ donation

success inspires villages in neighbourhood

HYDERABAD: At less than one per million population, India has one of the poorest organ donation rates in the world. But Mucherla in Telangana's Hanumakonda district is known for another kind of statistic - the 500 residents of this village have all pledged to donate their eyes after death.Over the past few years, around 70 villagers have donated their eyes.Mandala Ravinder, a divisional engineer in the irrigation department and a resident, told TOI he took the first step a decade ago by pledging to donate his mother's eyes. ""I strongly believe organs should not go waste after death. I pledged to donate my own organs and previously donated my father's organs in 2019. I encouraged others to follow suit, hoping it would help those in need and bring about positive change,"" he said.Inspired by Ravinder, many villagers followed suit, joining the movement to donate their organs and eyes. ""We inform Ravinder sir if a death occurs in the family. He, in turn, contacts the doctors, who do the needful. He is our go-to man,"" said Malla Reddy, a villager. Families actively participate in the cause, with many expressing how the decision has brought them closer, reinforcing the idea that even in death, one can continue to give, and live.The movement began several years ago when a few villagers took the first steps by pledging their eyes, and it quickly gained momentum. The success of Mucherla's organ donation initiative has sparked a ripple effect in neighbouring villages, with at least 20 individuals pledging to donate their eyes to the LV Prasad Eye Institute after their passing. Medical professionals regularly visit the village to conduct health camps and raise awareness about the importance of organ donation.Mucherla has also set up a well-organised system, keeping detailed records of those who have pledged to donate, and coordinating with hospitals in Hanumakonda district to ensure a prompt response when needed. ""We donated my mother's eyes, and I take immense pride in our contribution to reduce visual impairment in society,"" said B Sujatha, a villager. ""Our community's commitment has created a model of organ donation that continues to grow and inspire change. This achievement proves that when a community comes together with a shared purpose, we can make a meaningful difference,"" she told TOI.The village's dedication was recently acknowledged when it received the 'excellence in eye donation' award from the governor.","Mucherla in Telangana's Hanumakonda district has one of the poorest organ donation rates in the world.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

These included 27 kg and 558 grams of gold jewellery, 1,116 kg of silver, and documents related to 1,526 acres of land, previously stored in the Karnataka Vidhana Soudha treasury. The transfer took place on Friday, following a Bengaluru court’s order for Karnataka to hand over the valuables.The process was overseen by court and government officials, who documented and photographed the items, revealing an opulent golden crown, an extensive jewellery collection, and a sword with intricate engravings. Petitioner Narasimha Murthy told PTI that only jewellery and documents were handed over, while 27 other items remained with Jayalalithaa's secretary since 1996.On Friday, the Supreme Court rejected a plea by Jayalalithaa’s legal heir seeking the return of the confiscated assets. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma ruled that while the proceedings were abated after her death, it did not mean she was acquitted. The 2017 judgment in State of Karnataka v. J Jayalalithaa confirmed that the high court’s decision acquitting her had not attained finality.A special CBI court had earlier ordered the transfer of all confiscated assets to the Tamil Nadu government. The Karnataka High Court dismissed a plea by Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew, J Deepa and J Deepak, who claimed the properties as her legal heirs. The court upheld the confiscation, stating the conviction of her co-accused remained valid.The seized properties include Veda Nilayam, her Chennai residence, land parcels, estates, bank deposits, and valuables amassed between July 1991 and April 1996.","The Tamil Nadu government has officially taken possession of assets seized from late chief minister J Jayalalithaa.

'Absolutely right or meaningless'?

Additionally, another Congress MP Manish Tewari came out in support of Punjab CM.""He is absolutely right. The first aircraft that landed with immigrants who were brought back in inhuman conditions had most of the people from Gujarat. That flight should have landed in Gujarat, but it landed in Amritsar to create an impression that all illegal immigrants are from Punjab and that it is the only state with economic distress... If you are not able to crack down on agents, it is a failure of the government..,"" Priyanka Chaturvedi said.""What Bhagwat Mann said was merely to create headlines. It was all meaningless. The flight should have been landed in Delhi... Punjab is not getting defamed in any way. Punjab has a lot of NRIs, and they contribute to our economy in a big way. Punjabis are living a happy life abroad... What are the governments doing to stop such large-scale emigration?"" asked Congress's Gurjit Singh AujlaHe further questioned the state government over the actions taken to create employment in the state. ""What has the state government done to employ our people, and what is the state's law and order?... Because the people of Punjab are economically well-off, they prefer to go to the US. Indians have emigrated in large numbers to Europe and UAE as well... This shows the condition of our country. The BJP and AAP government should look into it...,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Manish Tewari reiterated Mann's views and said that the central government was ""trying to send a message that every illegal immigrant to the USA is from Punjab.""""...Why are these planes landing in Punjab? What is the kind of message you're trying to send? Are you trying to send a message that every illegal immigrant to the USA is from Punjab Punjab CM is absolutely correct to that extent. There were people from Gujarat and Haryana. You could have landed this plane in Delhi or anywhere else. Why in Amritsar all the time?...Delhi does not understand that Punjab does not take very easily to humiliation and there is always a cost to pay when Delhi tries to humiliate Punjab,"" he said.The political over the choice of state erupted on Friday after there were reports of two other fights from the US with illegal Indian deportees set to land in Amritsar over the weekend. There is no official confirmation of this so far.Reacting to these reports Punjab CM and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann had questioned the foreign policy and asked if a Bangladeshi national Sheikh Hasina could be made to land at Hindon, Ghaziabad, then why not Indian nationals.""The MEA should tell the criteria based on which Amritsar was selected to land the aircraft. You select Amritsar to defame Punjab. America's military planes are landing in Amritsar, and an enemy country, Pakistan, is right next to it. Lahore is 40 km from there... What kind of foreign policy is this?"" he had questioned.""Sheikh Hasina landed in Hindon. Ghaziabad. Why can these (Indian citizens who allegedly illegally migrated to the US) be landed in Hindon? Amritsar is being chosen deliberately to portray that only Punjabis are illegal migrants... Why is Ahmedabad or Ambala not chosen?... BJP always conspires to defame Punjab... They don't let international flights operate from Amritsar, claiming that it is not suitable for it, so why are flights coming in from the US now?... I will strictly oppose this... I demand to the MEA and the MHA that the plane is still onboard, change the route and make it land in Delhi, Hindon or Ahmedabad...,"" he added.BJP leaders dismissed the claims saying that this wasn't the first time that illegal immigrants have been deported. ""This is not the first time illegal immigrants have been deported. Even EAM mentioned that it has happened many times before... Now that it has been highlighted, it has created news. All those migrating illegally need to worry... Why doesn't Bhagwant Mann tell everyone that most of the deportees are Punjabis? The deportees arriving today also consist of people from Punjab and Haryana... Why isn't his government taking action against agents who facilitate illegal migration?"" BJP national spokesperson RP Singh said.Another flight carrying over 119 deportees is expected to land on Saturday at Amritsar airport. This comes only a week after 104 illegal Indians were sent back on a US military plane.","The political over the choice of state erupted on Friday after there were reports of two other fights from the US with illegal Indian deportees set to land in Amritsar over the weekend.

Army & IAF intensify hunt for advanced anti-drone systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-iaf-intensify-hunt-for-advanced-anti-drone-systems/articleshow/118290751.cms,"-Picture-

NEW DELHI: With the threat from hostile drones and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in both conventional and irregular warfare continuing to expand exponentially, the armed forces are stepping-up induction of a wide array of anti-drone systems but underline the urgent need for more advanced ones.The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDD&IS) to add to the ones already inducted under emergency procurements for the frontier with China.The IAF, in turn, wants 10 new kamikaze drones-based anti-swarm drone systems, 10 mobile micro munitions-based anti-swarm drone systems and 100-200 vehicle-mounted counter-UAS .Among other systems, IAF will begin inducting 200 radio frequency jammer guns from next month under a contract inked a year ago, while Army is getting around 30 vehicle-based drone jammers .“But much more advanced anti-drone systems, with multiple `soft-kill’ and `hard-kill’ options as well as much longer interception ranges, are urgently needed,” a senior officer said. These systems range from jamming, spoofing and blinding systems that disrupt the satellite or video command-and-control links of drones to laser-based directed energy weapons (DEWs) for hard-kills.A major problem, however, is that India is way behind other countries in indigenously developing such complex technologies. After DRDO developed anti-drone systems with 2-kilowatt to 10-kilowatt lasers, the armed forces ordered 23 such systems for around Rs 400 crore.“DRDO is developing DEWs with higher power. Many domestic private firms are also tying up with foreign companies for advanced anti-drone solutions. Let’s hope they work out,” another officer said.The Modi-Trump summit, incidentally, welcomed the new partnership between US company Anduril Industries and Indian Mahindra Group on advanced autonomous technologies to co-produce an “advanced AI-enabled counter-UAS”.The Army still relies heavily on old air defence systems, many of which have outlived their operational lives. “Though emergency procurements of anti-drone systems have been undertaken in recent years, they remain inadequate in countering the rapidly evolving threat from drones, which has been repeatedly reinforced by the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts,” he added.There is, for instance, the need to develop more advanced versions of the existing vehicle-mounted IDD&IS inducted by the Army Air Defence, which at present can soft-kill drones by jamming at 2 to 5-km range, with the effective hard-kill range through lasers only around 800-metre. “There is a mounting threat from low radar cross-section UAS and swarm drones,” an officer said.IAF air defence systems, with advanced radars and ground-to-air missile systems, are also geared towards thwarting air intrusions by large UAS, aircraft and helicopters. “The lack of adequate effective multi-sensor, multi-kill systems against smaller drones is an operational gap,” an officer said.A concerted effort is required to reduce the R&D time, fast-track procurement processes and ensure rapid induction of advanced counter-drone technologies. “The domestic defence industry should accelerate the production of advanced and scalable anti-drone systems to protect critical assets, particularly during wartime and heightened tensions,” he added.","The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems. The IAF, in turn, wants 10 new kamikaze drones-based anti-swarm drone systems and 100-200 vehicle-mounted counter-UAS.

AMRITSAR: An American aircraft carrying 116 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US was delayed and arrived at Amritsar's international airport a little past 11.30pm Saturday, the second such flight after a US military C-17 plane had brought back 104 deportees to the same airport on February 5.At a press conference earlier Saturday, Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Singh Mann had once again expressed anger over the flight landing in the holy city amid allegations of attempts by the Centre to ""tarnish the image of Punjab and Punjabis"". A third US flight carrying Indian deportees is expected to also land on Sunday, PTI reported, quoting official sources.When it was pointed out that the Centre had probably chosen Amritsar as the landing point for deportation flight as it was nearer to the US than other Indian airports, Mann shot back: ""If Amritsar is so close, then it would make sense to start flights from here to the US and Canada as we have been demanding.""Sixty-five of Saturday's deportees are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, 8 from Gujarat, two each from UP, Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, and one each from HP and J&K , PTI quoted official sources as saying, adding that 119 had been expected but an updated passenger manifest had been provided later.BJP national spokesperson RP Singh had said in a post on X on Saturday, in which Mann was tagged, ""Amritsar is the closest international airport for flights entering India from the US"" and that was why the US plane was landing there"".Mann also questioned the appropriateness of allowing a US military plane to land in a city close to the border, saying, ""Other countries are sending their civilian planes to bring back their deportees, so why are we allowing a US military plane to land here?"" He also asked whether Vatican City would allow a US military plane to land in its territory. [Vatican City has a heliport for VIPs; other visitors use Rome's airports.]Punjab's govt has arranged temporary accommodation for deportees from outside the state, who will leave for Delhi on a 6.30am flight on Sunday. Those from Punjab will be transported to their native places by road.Family members of some deportees who came to the airport expressed dissatisfaction with the Punjab govt's rehabilitation efforts.The relatives of Harjit Singh (22) and Harjot Singh (20), were deeply depressed. They had spent 45 lakh on each of the cousins to send them to the US. Their uncle, Nishan Singh, said the two young men from Khanowal, in Gurdaspur, had reached the US just 10 days ago but were caught and deported. He added that a US-based travel agent had assured them of legal entry into US.CM Mann, Union junior minister for railways Ravneet Singh Bittu and Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla had visited the airport for some time earlier in the day.Mann, asked at Saturday's press conference whether Indian deportees would be in restraints, said state govt did not have any information about this, and that PM Modi should have raised the issue with Donald Trump when he met him.",65 of 116 deportees in 2nd flight are from Punjab.

NEW DELHI: ""We didn't stop teaching arithmetic just because we got calculators. We need to teach students what the machines can't do and how to use machines (more efficiently)."" That's how the world's leading universities are coping with AI, according to Michael Spence , University College London ( UCL ) president & provost.Speaking at the ET Now Global Business Summit here Saturday, Spence said: ""There are three things we need to teach our students - the skills the machines will never have (like) interpersonal and cross-disciplinary skills. Then, we need to teach them to use the machines. My vice provost research is a cognitive neuroscientist who works on the consciousness of AI. When he asks Chat GPT questions, he gets much better answers than I do. And lastly, we continue to need to teach them the things the machines can do.""Spence said UCL has signed ""an unusual trilateral agreement "" with IIT Delhi and AIIMS.""This collaboration is bringing the latest in AI technologies with medical research and practice together,"" he added. Spence does not agree with the view that a college degree is not needed.""There's a lot I don't agree with Elon Musk about (and) this is one of them. We did a very large global study with employers in Australia, India, China, US, UK, Italy, France, and Germany (focussed) on just one question - what is the education that you're going to need to have the intellectual and social flexibility to survive the fourth Industrial Revolution ? Interestingly, almost everybody came back and said a deep understanding of the discipline. And that's because you need to know something about anything to develop core critical thinking skills that actually are going to mean that you survive. You also need a capacity to think across disciplines, a sort of T-shaped education that is multi-disciplinary, as well as disciplinary,"" Spence said.Students, he said, need an ""international perspective.""""We not only have students from about 160 countries, but we send our students right across the world for learning experiences of one kind or another.

"Move over tapas, Kerala chef’s NYC debut bets big on toddy shop ‘touchings’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/move-over-tapas-kerala-chefs-nyc-debut-bets-big-on-toddy-shop-touchings/articleshow/118282661.cms,"Chef Regi Mathew

Newly launched

Chatti restaurant

gives a global makeover to the

spicy side dishes

that are a mainstay of local liquor dens in Kerala

“If tapas can be the global face of Spanish food, why can’t 'touchings' be the same for Kerala?” It’s with this thought that chef Regi Mathew launched his first international venture Chatti in Manhattan’s Garment District in early February, blocks away from Times Square.‘Touchings’ are small, spiced side dishes made in toddy shops (kallu shaaps in local parlance) across Kerala. “While you’re having toddy, you touch and eat. That’s why it’s called touchings,” explains Mathew who as culinary director and founder of Kappa Chakka Kandhari (KCK) in Chennai and Bengaluru, has earned multiple Chef of the Year awards for celebrating Kerala’s homestyle cooking.For Chatti, Mathew was inspired by the food of Kerala's toddy shops where locals and curious tourists gather over frothy toddy — a fermented palm sap liquor — paired with fiery touchings. Think karimeen pollichathu (spiced pearl spot fish steamed in banana leaves), duck mappas, and spicy red fish curries. “In a state that values equity, debate, and free expression, toddy shops create space for people from all walks of life to come together, share a table, and engage in conversation over toddy and touchings,” he says, moved by the community spirit of these beloved, barebones drinking dens that act like cultural equalizers.Chatti (which means a traditional clay pot for cooking curries) joins a wave of Indian restaurants in the US that champion hyperlocal regional flavours, like Bungalow and the Michelin-starred Semma which spotlights Tamil Nadu’s rural homestyle cooking. These chefs are redefining Indian cuisine beyond idli-dosa-sambar and butter chicken, highlighting bold, unapologetic flavours from Indian homes and farms.‘Touchings’ are central to the Chatti experience. To guide diners, Mathew has done it up like a tapas bar. “The images are displayed on a table mat with an explanation, which guests find quite interesting. They can read up, point to the picture and say, ‘I want one of this’ or ‘One of that, please’,” says Mathew.The strategy works. “If two people come, they’ll order at least six to seven ‘touchings’. We have kept the pricing and portion smaller so they can try a lot of dishes,” he adds, holding out a menu that spans Kerala’s diverse landscape, from ‘prawn pouches steamed in banana leaves’ to ‘toddy shop beef fry’, ‘tender jackfruit cutlets’, ‘pearl spot parcels’, ‘clay pot fish curry’ and ‘gooseberry masala with pomfret’.Chef Mathew’s passion for food began in childhood, learning from his mother. He later trained globally, launching restaurants like Benjarong and Ente Keralam in Chennai. Known for his rigorous research, Mathew and his team spent over three years travelling across Kerala, visiting more than 300 homes and 100 toddy shops, testing around 800 recipes and perfecting rare home cooking techniques. This led to his flagship KCK’s Chennai launch in 2018, followed by Bengaluru.“When we went around Kerala, we realised our cuisine has so many hidden treasures, which we wanted to bring to the world. But I didn’t want to rush it,” says Mathew.The restaurant maintains deep ties with Kerala’s farming communities. “We are still bringing our spices from India because I’m particularly picky about what spice I should use. Peppercorns are sourced from Pulpally in Wayanad, jaggery from Marayoor, fresh tea leaves from Munnar, and cold-pressed coconut oil from a homemakers’ collective in Ernakulam,” says Mathew. Beyond spices, key ingredients like tapioca, coconut, jackfruit, and seafood are imported directly from Kerala. He collaborates with small enterprises and women’s groups for hand-picked spices and artisanal blends as well.Mathew smiles as he recalls the toddy shops of his youth in Kottayam. ""Growing up, we weren't allowed to visit these places. My mother would worry, thinking, 'I sent him to college, and he's off to a toddy shop instead!'"" he chuckles.But now with Chatti, Mathew has created a cultural bridge, bringing the warmth and conviviality of Kerala’s toddy shops to the world.","'Touchings' are small, spiced side dishes made in toddy shops (kallu shaaps in local parlance) across Kerala.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday said the Centre would soon set up a deregulation commission to ease the compliance burden on society and minimise govt interference.""We have ended hundreds of compliances, and now with Jan Vishwas 2.0, we are further reducing compliances. To reduce govt interference in society, a deregulation commission is also being established,"" said Modi, referring to the raft of measures undertaken in the past 10 years to revamp the complex web of laws and regulations.Addressing the ET Now Global Business Summit, Modi also said govt sees the private sector as a key partner in the country's journey towards transforming itself into a developed nation and asserted that fear of business has been transformed into ease of doing business.He said that tax relief announced in the latest Union Budget would strengthen the middle class and boost economic activity. ""To support the middle class, we have increased the limit of 'zero tax' from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 12 lakh in this year's budget.

He emphasised that this was the necessary pace for a young country like India and stressed that India was moving ahead with this very speed.Modi detailed the reforms undertaken in the past 10 years which he said has transformed India's economy. He said the banking sector was reformed and now public sector banks have reported record profits and access to credit has been accelerated to cover a wide section of the population, including the poor, with ""banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured, funding the unfunded"" being the govt's strategy.He said such initiatives may not have generated headlines, but changed the lives of all across the country. ""Swamitva Yojana has resulted in the recognition of rights of properties, enabling people in poor sections of the society to access loans, which are now far more easily available because of the growing network of bank branches and banking correspondents. Property worth Rs 1 lakh crore have been unlocked,"" the PM said, quoting a UN study.""This is the real story of reform - perform and transform,"" said the PM, adding that reforms earlier were undertaken only due to compulsion but now they were being taken with conviction.Reforms undertaken by his govt have strengthened the pillars of the economy, he said, while also mentioning that the private sector is benefiting from GST.

LUCKNOW: Solar fencing and trenches are passe. Tiger reserves in the country are deploying "" smart scarecrows "" to keep wildlife away from human habitations and mitigate human-animal conflicts.Named ' Aniders ', an acronym for ""animal intrusion detection and repellent system"", these scarecrows use a combination of loud buzzes of sound and intense light to startle the target animal and push back its movement.The Pilibhit forest division in UP has become the first in the state to deploy these 'Aniders'. It remains to be seen if the device can relieve the human population in the vicinity of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR), which faces the unique problem of ""sugarcane tigers"".PTR has seen a sharp increase in its tiger population, from 23 tigers in 2014 (when the reserve was formed) to 72 in 2022, far exceeding the reserve's capacity to support 30 to 35 tigers. Due to this, about 40% of PTR's tigers habitually stray into agricultural areas, leading to human-wildlife conflicts.It's been over a week since 10 of these solar-powered devices were placed at two villages, Mandaria and Dhankuni, in the social forestry division of Pilibhit, near the PTR, where tiger movement was reported recently.The setups are monitored by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and the forest department. ""WTI's field teams have not reported any further animal movement in and around these villages since the installation of 'Aniders'. However, it is too early to draw any conclusions. Monitoring of devices and forest fringe areas around the villages is on,"" Abhishek Ghosal of WTI said.","Pilibhit forest division in UP has become the first in the state to deploy these 'Aniders' It remains to be seen if the device can relieve the human population in the vicinity of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR), which faces the unique problem of ""sugarcane tigers""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118287596,imgsize-69250,width-400,resizemode-4/118287596.jpg"

He said the state govt lacks statistical evidence for such cases and is politicising the issue of forced conversion by labelling it as 'jihad.'The GR specified the committee's responsibilities: evaluating the current situation, handling complaints about 'love jihad' and forced religious conversions, examining other states' laws, establishing legal frameworks, and reviewing legal implications. The document mentioned requests from public representatives, organisations and citizens to prevent 'love jihad' and forced religious conversions.The committee will analyse current circumstances and recommend measures regarding 'love jihad' complaints and forced conversions, whilst studying existing legal structures in other states to develop suitable legislation.Shaikh said, ""Earlier the govt came up with a proposal after stating that there were over one lakh cases of 'love jihad' in the state, but they were unable to find a single instance where they could file a police case. There is no data available to support any such claim, and I had raised this issue in the assembly. The govt is playing politics over the issue.""When Fadnavis was deputy chief minister in the Mahayuti government in 2023, he had said, ""Many cases have come up of girls getting married and converting. There is demand from all corners to make a law against this. Earlier, I had made an announcement in the House also. Accordingly, study of laws in various states is on and then the decision about it in Maharashtra will be taken.""",Devendra Fadnavis had said in the past that Maharashtra was planning to introduce a law against forced religious conversions.

Concerns over Constitutional interpretation



NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday questioned the involvement of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in executive appointments , such as that of the CBI director, stating that it was time to ""revisit"" such norms. Speaking at the National Judicial Academy in Bhopal, he also raised concerns over the jurisprudential basis of the ‘doctrine of basic structure.’“To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director?” Dhankhar said, according to PTI reported. “Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit. This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India with any executive appointment!"" he added.The Vice President criticised what he termed as ""executive governance by judicial decree,"" calling it a ""constitutional paradox that the largest democracy on the planet cannot afford any longer."" Dhankhar emphasised that all institutions must function within their constitutional boundaries.“Governments are accountable to the legislature and periodically to the electorate. But if executive governance is arrogated or outsourced, enforceability of accountability will not be there,” he said. He added that any interference in governance by the legislature or judiciary was “antithetical to constitutionalism.”Dhankhar acknowledged the importance of judicial review, stating, “Judicial review is a good thing as it ensures that laws conform to the Constitution.” However, he stressed that the ultimate authority to amend the Constitution rests with Parliament.“The judiciary’s public presence must be primarily through judgments. Judgments speak for themselves… Any other mode of expression… undermines institutional dignity,” he remarked.On the basic structure doctrine , which restricts Parliament from altering certain fundamental features of the Constitution, Dhankhar said its jurisprudential basis was “very debatable.” Citing a book by former Solicitor General Andhyarujina on the Kesavananda Bharati case, he noted, “Having read the book, my view is that the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution has a debatable, very debatable, jurisprudential basis.”Recalling his tenure as Parliamentary Affairs Minister in 1990, Dhankhar pointed out that the Supreme Court had only eight judges at the time, yet constitutional interpretation required a five-judge bench. “Please note, when this strength was eight, it (size of constitutional bench) was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution,” he said.However, he warned against the misuse of constitutional interpretation. “Under the guise of interpretation, there can be no arrogation of authority, and the essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected,” he asserted.Referring to the expansion of the Supreme Court, he stated, “If I analyze arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by a majority of judges, because the (total) strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold.”Dhankhar also underscored the importance of free expression in a democracy. “If the right to express oneself is throttled or diluted, democracy gets thinner and thinner and thinner,” he remarked.","Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the Chief Justice of India in executive appointments.

India needs to weigh pros & cons of F-35 pitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-needs-to-weigh-pros-cons-of-f-35-pitch/articleshow/118258672.cms,"F - 35

NEW DELHI: India will have to very carefully evaluate US President Donald Trump’s offer of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter, even though the IAF would love to grab it with both hands given the China factor, while the two countries take forward the procurement of six more P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft as well as joint production of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles and Javelin anti-tank guided missiles this year.The expansive India-US defence relationship will get a further boost with PM Modi and Trump “pledging to elevate” military cooperation across air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, institute the ‘Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA)’, streamline defence trade and technology exchange, and sign a 10-year major defence partnership framework to renew the one inked in 2015.The sales pitch for the F-35, which is sold only to Nato countries and close allies, however, was the key takeaway. It might just be “a proposal” at this stage with the long-drawn formal process yet to even begin, as foreign secretary Vikram Misri said, but India will have to increasingly contend with a pushy Trump, whose deal-oriented transactional approach to geopolitics is well-known.“Starting this year, we will be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We are also paving the way to ultimately provide F-35 stealth fighters,” said Trump. The joint statement also noted the US’s “review of its policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters and undersea systems” to India.The pros and cons will have to be weighed. “India will inexorably be drawn into the US’s sphere of influence with the F-35 acquisition, impinging on its strategic autonomy. Why do you think successive Indian govts over the years have acquired Russian, French and other fighters but never American ones?” a senior official said.If India indeed pursues the F-35 offer, it will also have to factor in several things like the off-the-shelf price, the technologies being given, life-cycle costs, maintenance and the like, apart from the strategic benefits it can reap.Utmost care will have to be taken that India’s own 5th-Gen fighter project of the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), the development of which for over Rs 15,000 crore was cleared by the cabinet committee on security last March, is not adversely impacted.The operational 5th-Gen jets currently are the American F-35 Lightning-II and F/A-22 Raptor, the Chinese Chengdu J-20 and Russian Sukhoi-57. China has deployed J-20s at its airfields facing India and is even going to soon supply a variant to Pakistan, while it also conducted maiden flights of two new 6th-Gen prototypes in Dec.With the IAF grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorized 42.5, and Hindustan Aeronautics struggling to produce even a 4th-Gen Tejas, Indian national security planners are obviously concerned. “With AMCA still at least 10-12 years away from production, IAF will obviously be deeply interested in getting two to three squadrons (36 or 54 jets) of F-35s in the interim. If you need deterrence to prevent wars, you obviously need capabilities,” another official said.The F-35 could now even fly its way into IAF’s long-delayed project for 114 new multi-role fighter aircraft to be produced in India with foreign collaboration at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore. The defence ministry is working to break the logjam over this project, where French Rafale, Russian Sukhoi-57, Swedish Gripen-E, Eurofighter Typhoon and American F-15EX are the contenders.There is also the lingering question of the Russian S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems being inducted under the $5.43 billion contract in Oct 2018. The US is wary of any country operating F-35s and S-400s together since the latter’s powerful radars can “map or record” data of the former’s stealth characteristics, electronic warfare and other capabilities. This, too, will need to be resolved.","The sales pitch for the F-35, which is sold only to Nato countries and close allies, was the key takeaway. India will have to increasingly contend with a pushy Trump, whose deal-oriented transactional approach to geopolitics is well- known. “India will inexorably be drawn into the US’s sphere of influence, impinging on its strategic autonomy,” a senior official said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118258692,imgsize-35708,width-400,resizemode-4/118258692.jpg"

, the Indiana Fever ’s rising star, will not be participating in theevent, despite receiving an invitation. The decision has sparked conversations among fans and analysts, as Clark continues to make an impressive impact on her fans with her WNBA career.The NBA All-Star weekend has long been a platform for collaboration between the NBA and WNBA, with stars from both leagues competing in events. Last year, the league featured a thrilling one-on-one 3-point contest between Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry and New York Liberty’s Sabrina Ionescu. This year, discussions included adding Caitlin Clark and Klay Thompson to the mix for a potential two-on-two showdown. However, the idea was ultimately scrapped, and Clark declined her invitation.Clark’s decision stems from her desire to make her first 3-point contest appearance at the WNBA All-Star weekend .her representatives stated. This summer’s WNBA All-Star weekend holds special significance, as it will be hosted in Indianapolis for the first time, with Clark expected to be a central figure.Last year, Caitlin Clark skipped the NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest 2025, citing the need for rest after transitioning directly from college basketball to the professional league. This year, she’s focused on making her mark in the WNBA’s marquee event.Clark’s rookie season has been nothing short of impressive. She won the Rookie of the Year award, averaging 19.2 points, 8.4 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game. She also led the league in 3-pointers made per game (3.0) and assists per game (8.4), solidifying her status as one of the WNBA’s most promising talents.Fans might be sad to miss Clark's shooting prowess during the NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest 2025, but her choice shows how dedicated she is to the WNBA and its rising stature. Clark's attendance at the WNBA All-Star weekend will surely enhance the occasion and allow her to display her skills on a platform she has chosen to prioritize as the league continues to grow.Also read: NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest 2025: All rules, detailed format, scores, judges, and more For now, all eyes will be on Indianapolis this summer, where Caitlin Clark is set to shine.","Caitlin Clark has declined an invitation to participate in the NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest 2025.

Trump-Modi Summit: $25 Deal, F-35 Jets, 26/11 Extradition | Key Takeaways From High-Stakes Meeting

Amid the launch of new initiatives, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump reaffirmed in a joint statement that the India-US partnership is central to a free and open Indo-Pacific. However, as Trump takes upon himself to resolve conflicts and in his own way, a glaring omission from the statement was any mention of the Russia-Ukraine war, or any stock reference to the UN Charter or territorial integrity on that issue, that had featured prominently in such bilateral and even multilateral documents with the Biden administration.According to the joint statement, the leaders also committed to strengthening law enforcement cooperation to take decisive action against illegal immigration networks, organized crime syndicates, including narco-terrorists human and arms traffickers, as well as other elements who threaten public and diplomatic safety and security, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both nations. India sees this as important for putting a check on the activities of Khalistan separatists on US soil. “There's a commitment to strengthening law enforcement cooperation in this regard and this is especially significant from our perspective given some events that have taken place,’’ said foreign secretary Vikram Misri. The leaders also publicly called upon Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism.According to government sources, Modi had detailed discussions with Trump about concerns on both sides regarding market access and the problems arising out of Chinese industrial overcapacity, while asking officials to conclude a mutually beneficial trade deal by fall this year. “They discussed concerns arising from other territories with over capacities that take advantage of consumption in countries like India and the US. They discussed ways and means to address these issues in an overall context,’’ said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The joint statement was also shorn of any focus on climate or global health, issues that made the cut with the previous administration.The Trump administration strongly backed initiatives like IMEEC and iCET although the latter seemed to have been rechristened TRUST (transforming the relationship utilising strategic technology). TRUST, according to the joint statement, will catalyse government-to-government, academia and private sector collaboration to promote application of critical and emerging technologies in areas like defence, AI, semiconductors and quantum computing, while ensuring protection for sensitive technologies. They agreed to finalise a US-India roadmap on accelerating AI infrastructure.While there was no direct mention of the conflict in West Asia, the leaders agreed to increase cooperation, enhance diplomatic consultations, and increase tangible collaboration with partners in the region. They highlighted the importance of investing in critical infrastructure and economic corridors to advance peace and security in the region, pledging new announcements this year to take forward IMEEC and I2U2 – comprising India, Israel, UAE and US – initiatives.On cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, as Quad partners, the leaders reiterated that this partnership is underpinned by the recognition of Asean centrality, adherence to international law, support for safety and freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, and unimpeded lawful commerce.“PM Modi looks forward to hosting President Trump in New Delhi for the Quad leaders’ Summit, ahead of which the leaders will activate new Quad initiatives on shared airlift capacity to support civilian response to natural disasters and maritime patrols to improve interoperability,’’ said the joint statement. The 2 sides also launched the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture, a new bilateral forum to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce.The leaders welcomed the proposed Indian amendments of the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) for nuclear reactors, saying this path forward will unlock plans to build large US-designed reactors and enable collaboration to develop, deploy and scale up nuclear power generation with advanced small modular reactors.As expected, there was a strong condemnation of terrorism with Trump and Modi backing action against groups like LeT, JeM, ISIS and al Qaeda. As the US formally announced the extradition of Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana, the leaders called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.","PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump reaffirmed in a joint statement that the India-US partnership is central to a free and open Indo-Pacific.

New Income Tax Bill 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the New Income Tax Bill 2025 in Lok Sabha earlier this week. The New Income Tax Bill is expected to replace the decades old Income Tax Act 1961. It is less complicated and easier for the taxpayer to understand, says the government. The government has released a list of top 30 FAQs that taxpayers may have about the New Income Tax Bill 2025. We take a look:The current Income-tax Act was enacted in 1961 and came into existence with effect from 01.04.1962. It has been amended nearly 65 times with more than 4000 amendments, year on year through Finance Acts, based on the evolving requirements of modifications in taxation Policy.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025: Read full text of proposed new I-T Act Tax administrators, practitioners and taxpayers have acknowledged the contribution ofthe Income-tax Act, 1961 in overall tax governance and economy. However, over the time concerns have also been expressed over the accumulation of amendments, the intricate language, detailed provisions, redundancies and the heavy structure of the Income-tax Act.The Income-tax Act is dynamic legislation requiring regular updating and amendments to reflect the nation’s changing economic, social, and political realities. Criminal and other civil laws do not undergo such frequent updating and amendments whereas the Income-tax Act is regularly updated (on annual basis) to reflect the economic changes, fiscal policies, and government priorities. It, therefore, adapts to changes in the economy, business environments, inflation rates, income sources, and global financial trends. The government has introduced tax reforms to encourage specific sectors of the economy while balancing the same with requirements of revenue collection and widening/deepening of the tax base. Given its direct link to taxation and economic conditions, the Act needs to be more adaptable to reflect shifting economic policies, changing incomes, inflation, and emerging industries. The dynamic nature of the Income-tax Act provides it flexibility to accommodate new economic trends.Examples:i. To promote exports, specific provisions such as 80HH, 80HHC were brought into the statute. The same having served intended purpose have been since omitted or made inapplicable after sun set date.ii. To promote infrastructure development, section 80IA was brought into Income-tax Act, 1961.iii. Sections 80HHE, 10A and 10AA were introduced for facilitating software exports.iv. Section 80IAC is yet another example of encouraging the start-ups.The income tax law has become increasingly bulky over time, with its traditional style of drafting and numerous amendments. The complexity of language in the present Act is a product of different factors. To keep pace with certain legal pronouncements, explanations and provisos were often inserted to clarify legislative intent. Changing taxation priorities also led to introduction of additional text to an otherwise simple provision. Further, certain provisions remained in the statute, despite becoming non-operational, in view of pending claims/issues from earlier years.Attempts have been made in the past, including those in 2009 and 2019 for simplification of the Income tax Act. The recommendations from these efforts, as regards policy, have been considered in the amendments carried out from time to time.Simplification of tax laws has received attention globally. Countries have undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. In the UK, the process was carried out during the period 1994 to 2010 for simplifying the language. Before simplification, the UK Income and Corporation Tax Act, 1988 comprised 960 pages. However, after simplification, it was divided into five separate Acts, with their page counts increased, resulting in a more segmented but overall larger body of tax law.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: 10 key takeaways for taxpayers - top points you should know Similarly, Australia underwent a similar process during 1994 to 1997, where simplification of language also resulted in a longer tax code.These international experiences emphasize the delicate balance between simplification and the need for clear, unambiguous legal language. Drawing from these lessons, effort has been made to focus not just on linguistic simplification but also on structural rationalization.The Hon’ble Finance Minister in the budget speech in July 2024 stated that the purpose of the comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, is to make the Act “concise, lucid, easy to read and understand”.Following ground rules have been considered for simplifying the existing provisions:i. The Bill proposes to eliminate redundant provisions, reducing its length by nearly half.ii. The drafting style of the new Bill is straightforward and clear, making the provisions easier to understand by incorporating more than 57 tables compared to 18 tables in the Income-tax Act, 1961. Sub-sections and clauses have been used, instead of relying on provisos and explanations for exceptions and carve-outs. This minimises cross references and conflict by aggregating all applicable provisions related to a single scenario in one place.iii. All provisos (about 1200) and explanations (about 900) have been removed.iv. The 1961 Act contains numerous cross-references to sections, sub-sections, clauses, sub-clauses, items, and sub-items, making the provisions challenging to interpret. The new Bill adopts a simplified reference system, allowing provisions to be cited by simply mentioning the section. For instance, section 133 (1)(b)(ii) in the new bill would indicate sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 133 in the existing Act. This change makes the Act's language easier to understand.v. A significant aspect of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. Prior to 1989, the concept of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’ had been brought because the taxpayers could have different twelve-month previous years for each source of income. From 1st April 1989, previous year was aligned to a financial year in all cases. However, ‘assessment year’ continued to be used for various proceedings under the Act. Thus, a taxpayer was required to track two different periods, i.e., the ‘previous year’ as well as the ‘assessment year’. This presented difficulties in complying to the provisions of the Act especially for a new taxpayer who had to keep track of ‘previous year’, ‘assessment year’ as well as ‘financial year’.Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime A comprehensive consultative process was undertaken for the simplification exercise. A total of 20,976 online suggestions for simplification and removal of redundancies were received, analysed and relevant suggestions were categorized into policy-related, language simplification, removal of redundant or obsolete provisions, etc. Meetings with industry and professional associations were held and field-level brainstorming sessions were held within the Income Tax Department, towards this exercise.At the international level, consultations were held with some of the taxation authorities that had undertaken similar exercise in the recent past, viz. the Australian Tax Office and Treasury, and the UK’s Office of Tax Simplification.The documents prepared in 2009 and 2019, were also referred, while undertaking the exercise. International and national guidance material such as ‘Drafting Guide for Simplification of Laws’ issued by Legislative Department, Ministry of Law and Justice, was studied for simplification of legal language.In addition to the stakeholder exercise mentioned in Q I.9, suggestions were sought from taxpayers, industry and professional associations, and field level officers of the Department. A committee of around 150 officers of the Department was actively involved in the entire exercise. The Committee prepared the draft text of various chapters, which was meticulously vetted by the Legislative Department of Ministry of Law and Justice, and consolidated in the form of the final Bill, after necessary approvals.More than 60,000 man-hours were dedicated by the team for finalising the new Bill.The readability of tax law has been improved by using simpler language, as against traditional legal language. Where multiple situations are covered, the sections have been made enumerative. Wherever feasible, extensive use of table formats has been made. TDS provisions have been presented in a tabular form. Certain provisions such as section 10, which contained about 150 clauses has been placed in Schedules and presented in the form of tables.As a result of the comprehensive exercise, the size of the new Bill has reduced by about half on one hand and one the other, the provisions have been consolidated and presented in a user friendly format.Provisos (more than 1200) and Explanations (more than 900) have been removed, with their simplified content placed as sub-sections or clauses. Wherever feasible, procedural aspects and specific details are proposed to be provided by way of Rules.Yes. Certain provisions became redundant due to numerous amendments and/or policy changes over the years. This resulted in large number of such provisions in the Act. For example, deduction under section 10A, which was a special provision for newly established industrial undertakings in the free trade zones, is no longer available from the Assessment Year 2012-13, onwards. Such obsolete provisions have been removed from the text of the Bill.However, provisions applicable to earlier Assessment Years shall be governed by Repeal and Savings provisions.In addition to removal of ‘provisos’, ‘explanation’ and redundant provisions, formulae, tables, and structures have been used to enhance clarity in the new bill. To the extent possible, provisions involving the same issues, which were present in different chapters in the current Act, have now been consolidated. Redundancy has been removed and definitions at multiple places have been consolidated.In case of provisions relating to Non-Profit organisations (NPOs), the entire text related to NPOs has been consolidated and structured into 7 sub-parts which contain provisions related to Registration, Income, Commercial activities, Compliances, Violations, Registrations for the purposes of eligibility of donations and Interpretations.The new Income-tax Bill is approximately half the length of the existing Income-tax Act 1961, with significant re-organisation of provisions in different sections. While undertaking simplification exercise, a conscious attempt has been made to minimise the scope of litigation and fresh interpretations. For this purpose:a. Key words/phrases, especially where courts have given rulings, have been retained with minimal modifications.b. Language has been simplified by use of short sentences to the extent possible.c. Sections have been translated into row or sub-rows in tables, reducing the number of words and bringing clarity.d. Provisions have been made clear to minimize scope for multiple interpretations. The provisos and explanations have been removed and simplified content has been placed as sub-sections and clauses.e. Provisions related to international taxation have been dealt with, broadly, to ensure tax certainty.f. NGO chapter has been made more comprehensive with use of plain language.g. Exemption sections, for example section 10 in the present Act, has been made simpler through tables and placing large number of provisions in Schedules.h. Formulae and tables have been used to enhance clarity, wherever feasible.i. Provisions involving same issues and definitions, which were present in different chapters in the existing Act have been consolidated, to the extent possible.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained There has been a significant reduction in the text of new Bill, in comparison to the existing Income Tax Act, as summarised below.* Effective SectionsBesides about 1200 Provisos and 900 Explanations have been removed.During the course of numerous amendments to the Income tax Act, 1961, several policy decisions were incorporated as separate provisions. Many a times such provisions were connected to already existing sections and accordingly the new sections were numbered in continuation to the existing sections. For example, several provisions relating to tax on special cases were inserted as sections starting with 115 series viz 115 AC,115AD, 115JB, 115VP etc.As a result of such insertions, effective sections existing in the Income tax Act, 1961 are 819.While the existing Income-tax Act contains 298 numbered sections, effective sections in the current Act are 819. This is because other than numeric section numbers there are large number of sections with alpha-numeric codes such as 115A to 115WM (117 sections) and so on. The Income-tax Act not only deals with levy of tax but it is a comprehensive document, which encompasses all aspects of tax administration. It also includes other aspects such as:(a) laying down the administrative framework, assigning roles and responsibilities for assessing officers, taxpayers, tax deductors, and professionals etc;(b) setting out the framework for income determination, timelines, appellate procedures, enforcement, assessments, and penalties; and(c) taking into account the impact of interpretations on economic policy, affecting both domestic and international investments.The new Bill proposes 536 sections to meet the above-mentioned requirements.Further, several sections in the new Bill exist primarily to honour the commitments under the existing tax regime, including provisions relating to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), various deductions and exemptions, etc. These provisions will remain in force until their respective sunset clauses take effect. Therefore, these are required to be part of new Bill to ensure a smooth transition, while maintaining legal and policy continuity.The simplification exercise, inter-alia, encompasses following aspects:i. Redundant provisions of the Income tax Act have been removed;ii. Sub-sections and clauses have been used, instead of relying on provisos and explanations for exceptions and carve-outs;iii. Simplified system for cross referencing of sections, sub-sections, clauses etc has been used;iv. Extensive use of tables, formulae for enhanced clarity;v. Consolidation of provisions scattered across various sections/ Chapters relating to a single issue; etcSince there have been regular amendments to the Income Tax Act, 1961 including amendments proposed in Finance Bill, 2025, the Act stands updated from policy perspective. All amendments proposed upto Finance Bill 2025 have been duly incorporated in the new Income tax bill 2025. Therefore, while no major policy related changes have been made in the Bill, the above aspects have led to proposed ‘material’ changes in the existing law.Section-wise mapping will be made available on the official website of the Income Tax Department.The concept of ‘tax year’ has been introduced replacing ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. The timelines and computation in the Bill are now with reference to the financial year for which the income is liable to be taxed. It is expected that the use of ‘tax year’ will make the new Bill easier to comprehend. Further, many of the comparable tax jurisdictions in the world are using one single term, for purpose of denoting the unit period of taxation. ‘Tax year’ is commonly used in many countries.With the introduction of ‘tax year’, broadly the following principles have been adopted:i. ‘Tax Year’: Unit period of taxation. This term shall be referred in respect of all transactions and income for that period.ii. ‘Financial Year’: For purposes of timelines for compliance and for procedural issues.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables. There are separate tables for payment to residents and non-residents, and where no deduction at source is required. For example, the proposed provisions relating to TDS on rent are shown below:(Reference can be made to Table in proposed section 393 of the Bill)The provisions related to Non-Profit Organizations were present at different places in the existing Act, in section 11, section 12, section 12A, section 12AA, section 12AB, section 13, section 115BBC, section 115BBI, section 115TD, section 115TE, section 115TF. The provisions related to approval are under the first and second proviso to section 80G (5). These have been simplified and consolidated into one chapter. All the provisions related to registered Non-Profit Organisations have now been arranged in Part B of Chapter XVII titled “B.–– Special Provisions for Registered Non-Profit Organisation” in the new Bill.All the provisions pertaining to salary have been consolidated at one place for ease of understanding so that the taxpayer does not have to refer to separate chapters for filing his return of income. The deductions which were earlier allowed under section 10 of the Income Tax Act,1961, like gratuity, leave encashment, commutation of pension, compensation on VRS and retrenchment compensation, are now part of the salary chapter itself. Some of the allowances like HRA are now provided in Schedule II of the new Bill that finds reference in the provisions relating to salary. The objective was to improve readability by way of providing tables and formulas.While the chargeability of all the perquisites has been retained in the Act, their valuation, conditions and exceptions have been shifted to Rules as they do not affect every taxpayer. Similarly, redundant and repetitive provisions have also been removed for better readability.Provisions relating to exemptions for specific incomes and persons are being moved to separate schedules for easier reference and simpler compliance as follows:Stage 1: Bill is passed by the Parliament and becomes an ActStage 2: Operational and delegated legislation frameworki. Notification of new Rules and Forms.ii. Simultaneous exercise of software development to set up the systems and processes for various administrative and quasi-judicial functions.Various facets of compliance for the respective years have been mentioned in the Repeals and Savings clause in the Bill, which will safeguard all rights and liabilities accrued under the old law.There are no changes related to rates. Since there have been regular amendments to the Income Tax Act, 1961 including amendments proposed in Finance Bill, 2025, the Act stands updated from policy perspective. All amendments proposed upto Finance Bill 2025 have been duly incorporated in the new Income tax bill 2025. Therefore, while no major policy related changes have been made in the Bill, the above aspects have led to proposed ‘material’ changes in the existing law.The Income Tax Bill 2025 also contains all amendments proposed in Finance Bill 2025. Therefore, the users are advised to compare the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as updated with proposed amendments in Finance bill 2025, while reading the Income Tax Bill, 2025. There is, therefore, no change in the scope of ‘virtual digital asset’ under the Income Tax Bill, 2025. The definition under the Bill incorporates the amendment already proposed under the Finance Bill, 2025.As noted above, the total words in the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 are around 2.6 lakhs, as against 5.12 lakh words in the Income Tax Act, 1961. Some of the Chapters where substantial reduction of words have been achieved are as given below:","The government has released a list of top 30 FAQs that taxpayers may have about the New Income Tax Bill 2025.

In a surprising revelation, conservative influencer and author Ashley St. Clair has publicly claimed that she gave birth to a child fathered by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. The statement, made through a post on X (formerly Twitter), has sparked widespread discussion across social media platforms. St. Clair, 31, disclosed that her child, now five months old, was fathered by Musk, marking the tech mogul’s 13th known child. The announcement has generated intense media scrutiny, with Musk yet to confirm or deny the claim. This development adds another layer of complexity to Musk’s personal life, which has been under public attention due to his multiple relationships and children with different women.On Friday night, St. Clair took to X to make the revelation, stating,She captioned the post witha Latin phrase meaningsuggesting that she had decided to make the claim public despite possible consequences.In her post, St. Clair emphasized that she had refrained from disclosing this information earlier to protect her child’s privacy and safety. However, she stated that tabloid media had begun pursuing the story and would expose it regardless of her intentions. She urged the media to respect her child’s privacy and avoid invasive reporting.Despite the public nature of the claim, Musk has not addressed St. Clair’s statement. He remained active on X following the announcement but did not comment on the matter. The billionaire has a history of keeping aspects of his personal life private, and his silence has fueled further speculation.If St. Clair’s claim is confirmed, the child would be Musk’s 13th. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has fathered children with four different women:This latest claim by St. Clair, if true, would add another child to Musk’s already large family, further cementing his well-documented advocacy for increasing birth rates.Following St. Clair’s post, social media platforms were abuzz with reactions. Some users expressed skepticism, questioning the authenticity of the claim, while others supported her call for privacy. Several prominent figures, including journalists and influencers, weighed in on the controversy.St. Clair later followed up her announcement with another post, stating,The post suggests that she may not engage further on the topic, at least for now. Meanwhile, Musk has continued posting about other topics on X, avoiding direct comments on the matter.Ashley St. Clair is a well-known conservative commentator and influencer. She has built a following through her political views and social media presence. St. Clair has authored books and regularly engages in debates on current affairs.Recently, she was seen at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden, dressed in Balenciaga, indicating her continued involvement in public events despite her announcement. She also ended a long break from Instagram, posting a picture from former President Donald Trump’s inauguration.Given her political leanings and past interactions on social media, some have speculated about her motives for making this claim public at this particular time. However, without further clarification from either St. Clair or Musk, the full context remains uncertain.","Conservative author Ashley St. Clair claims she gave birth to a child fathered by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.

How Google CEO Sundar Pichai may have just agreed with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's sentence that wiped billions from market cap of quantum computing companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-may-have-just-agreed-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-sentence-that-wiped-billions-in-market-cap-of-quantum-computing-companies/articleshow/118189292.cms,"What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang exactly said



Google CEO Sundar Pichai may have echoed a sentiment made earlier this year by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang—one that previously sent quantum computing stocks plunging. According to Bloomberg, Pichai, speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, said that “practically useful” quantum computers are still 5 to 10 years away, likening their progress to AI’s development a decade ago. Many quantum computing stocks, some of which had surged over 1,000% in the past year, could face renewed pressure following his comments.“The quantum moment reminds me of where AI was in the 2010s, when we were working on Google Brain and the early progress,” Pichai said. Google CEO also cited a recent Google breakthrough in quantum chips, which allowed researchers to calculate in five minutes a problem that would take existing supercomputers “longer than our universe has been around.” “The progress in quantum is palpably exciting,” he said.During Nvidia's analyst day at CES trade show in Las Vegas (US), Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that “very useful” quantum computers are likely decades away and may take 15-30 years. He told analysts that quantum computers would need 1 million times the number of quantum processing units, called qubits, that they currently have. The statement sent shock waves, sending quantum stocks in a free fall. So much so that the selling frenzy even swept up companies based on their names: Quantum Corp, a data management company, gained more than 670% last year, only to drop about 60% so far in 2025. Quantum-Si Inc., a life science company developing protein sequencing platforms, nearly quadruped in the last two months of 2024.Governments, led by the US and China, and corporations are pledging billions of dollars to quantum computing research in the pursuit of futuristic technology. Quantum computers dramatically increase the speed and capacity of data that can be processed, making it possible to model complex systems, more accurately predict the outcome of different scenarios and break current encryption systems.The quantum computing sector has seen increased attention following Google's December 2024 announcement of its Willow quantum chip breakthrough. Google said that it has completed a 100 qubit chip, marking the second of six steps in its strategy to build a quantum system with 1 million qubits. However, the technology is still mainly used for research, and there’s a debate about when it will come into its own.Last year, Microsoft CEO announced, ""As we make progress on our journey to large-scale quantum computing, I’m thrilled to share we have achieved the most performant logical qubits on record – and we’re bringing a new generation of reliable quantum hardware to customers.""","Google CEO Sundar Pichai likens progress in quantum computing to AI's development a decade ago.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
