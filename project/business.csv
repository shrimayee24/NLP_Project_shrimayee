NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar , during his visit to Berlin on Friday, strongly condemned the recent Pahalgam terror attack and said that India has tolerance for terrorism and New Delhi will ""never give in to nuclear blackmail"" referring to crossborder terrorism backed by Pakistan.He also added that all issues with Pakistan will be handled bilaterally, without any third-party involvement.Jaishankar is in Berlin on the final leg of his three-nation tour to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. He held meetings with key German leaders, including foreign minister Johann Wadephul and Chancellor Friedrich Merz, focusing on strengthening the India-Germany partnership.At a joint press conference with Wadephul, Jaishankar said: ""I came to Berlin in the immediate aftermath of India responding to the Pahalgam terror attack. Let me share with you what I conveyed to Mr Wadephul in that context. India has zero-tolerance for terrorism. India will never give in to nuclear blackmail.""He added: ""India will deal with Pakistan purely bilaterally. There should be no confusion in any quarter in that regard.""He also reflected on brutality of terror attack in J&K's Pahalgam and India's strong response afterwards, at German Council, saying, ""This was a terrorist attack, which is part of a pattern which has targeted not only J&K but other parts of India as well...thiswas meant to create a fear psychosis and destroy the tourism economy of the Kashmir...and sow religious discord...what we were responding to were terrorism. ..and when we responded there were a lot of international understanding...we targeted terrorist headquarters and terror sites. Our campaign is against terrorism, and in this case, terrorists happen to be located in the country next door because that country, for many years, has used terrorism as a tool.""Following their talks, the German foreign minister condemned the terrorist attack and expressed support for India’s right to defend itself. He also supported resolving India-Pakistan issues directly, without external involvement.After the meeting, Jaishankar posted on X: ""Excellent meeting today with FM Johann Wadephul in Berlin. Deeply appreciate Germany's understanding of India's right to defend itself against terrorism.""He also said that both sides discussed deepening the Strategic Partnership and exploring new areas of cooperation, including regional and global issues.His remarks came after India launched Operation Sindoor in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. On May 7, India carried out precision strikes and destroyed nine terror camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan attempted to retaliate between May 8 and 10 by targeting Indian military bases, but met India's strong air defence system response.The confrontations ended with a ceasefire on May 10.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared a ""new normal."" saying that any future act of crossborder terrorism will be treated as an ""act of war.""Jaishankar and German officials also celebrated 25 years of the India-Germany Strategic Partnership. He noted that Germany is India’s largest economic partner in the European Union, and both countries have expanded cooperation across various sectors in recent years.He also praised Germany’s role in supporting a free trade agreement between India and the European Union. Both sides are working to finalise the deal by the end of this year, which could significantly boost business ties.In addition to his meetings with political leaders, Jaishankar met Germany’s minister of economy and energy, Katherina Reiche, to discuss enhancing industry cooperation, skilled talent exchange, and supply chain resilience.He also had talks with Gunter Sautter, foreign and security policy advisor to Chancellor Merz, and interacted with members of the German Parliament, thanking them for their support in growing India-Germany relations.","Jaishankar is in Berlin on the final leg of his three-nation tour to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany.

The Trump administration's decision to revoke Harvard's eligibility to enrol foreign students raised concerns over the legal status of thousands of students, including nearly 800 from India, currently enrolled at the elite school.At present, Harvard hosts about 10,158 students and scholars from around the world across its schools. According to data, there are 788 students and scholars from India for 2024-25 academic year.Ajay Bhutoria, a former advisor to Joe Biden, said Indian students contribute over $9 billion annually to the US economy and strengthen ties. ""This policy directly threatens over 500 Indian students at Harvard, forcing them to transfer or leave the US before the next academic year,"" he said. It also sends a ""chilling message"" to Indian students and the broader South Asian diaspora that ""your contributions are not valued"".","The Trump administration's decision to revoke Harvard's eligibility to enrol foreign students raised concerns over the legal status of thousands of students.

"'Tough life': SC directs IAF not to release woman officer who served in Operations Sindoor, Balakot till further orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tough-life-sc-directs-iaf-not-to-release-woman-officer-who-served-in-operations-sindoor-balakot-till-further-orders/articleshow/121362528.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed the government and the Indian Air Force (IAF) not to release Wing Commander Nikita Pandey from service, after she alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission despite her critical role in Operation Balakot and Operation Sindoor. Noting a ""tough life"" for Short Service Commission (SSC) officers, the bench in ""layman's suggestion"" said its ""uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces.""A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to the Centre and the IAF on Thursday, seeking their response on Pandey’s plea, news agency PTI reported. She claimed that although she ranked second in the country among expert fighter controllers and had served over 13.5 years, she was being discharged due to a 2019 policy change that denied her a permanent commission.“Our Air Force is one of the best organisations in the world. Officers are very commendable. The quality of coordination they have exhibited - I think it's unparalleled. Therefore, we always salute them. They are a big asset for the nation. They are the nation, in a way. Because of them, we are able to sleep at night,” Justice Kant said.The bench expressed concern over the uncertainty faced by SSC officers, stating that a long tenure without permanent commission needed to be addressed.“That sense of uncertainty may not be good for the armed forces. It's a layman's suggestion, because we are not experts. On minimum benchmarks, there can't be a compromise,” Justice Kant added.Representing Pandey, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy argued that her client was an expert fighter controller, who had played a key role in the Integrated Air Command and Control Systems (IACCS) deployed during Operations Sindoor and Balakot.Pandey’s case, Guruswamy said, was affected by policy shifts that gave her just a month’s notice to end her career despite her stellar service record.Appearing for the government and the IAF, additional solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said that the officer had been found unfit by the selection board and had approached the apex court directly without first filing a representation. She also confirmed that a second selection board would now review Pandey’s case.Bhati, herself from a military background, acknowledged the difficult position of SSC officers but explained, “There are a limited number of posts. It's a very steep pyramid structure.”She noted that typically, 90–95 per cent of officers considered for permanent commission are found fit, but only a few miss out due to comparative merit.Justice Kant responded, urging a more accommodating approach, “You can have a policy of taking that many SCC officers who can be accommodated in the Permanent Commission, if they are found suitable. If you have 100 SCC officers, you should have the capacity to take 100 of them to the permanent commission.”He also emphasised that women officers have performed exceedingly well and highlighted the need for systemic capacity to retain them.The court directed that Wing Commander Pandey must not be released from service until further orders and posted the matter for hearing on August 6.However, the bench clarified that no equity would be created in the officer’s favour at this stage and that all contentions remain open.","Wing Commander Nikita Pandey alleged discrimination in being denied permanent commission despite her critical role in Operation Balakot and Operation Sindoor.

TMC Delegation Meets With Families Affected By Pak Shelling Along LoC In Poonch | Jammu Kashmir

Poll Do you think emergency requests for airspace entry should be granted regardless of political tensions? Yes, passenger safety is paramount. No, it could escalate tensions further.

Window shades must remain shut during take-off, landing at defence airports: DGCA

Indigo, Air India Cancel Flights Amid Drone Scare Even After Ceasefire | Is Flying Still Safe?

NEW DELHI: The pilot of IndiGo's Delhi-Srinagar flight on Wednesday requested permission from Lahore ATC to briefly enter Pakistan airspace to escape turbulence after being caught in a sudden hailstorm. Sources said Lahore ATC denied the request, prompting the Airbus A321 pilot to declare an emergency with Srinagar ATC.The flight, carrying over 220 passengers, including Trinamool MPs, landed safely in Srinagar, but not without damage - the aircraft's radome, or nose cone, was left badly battered by the storm.A senior official from Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said, ""We've asked IndiGo for a detailed report and a probe is underway. The aircraft (VT-IMD) remains grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being praised for their presence of mind and professionalism in ensuring everyone's safety.""IndiGo, in an official statement, said: ""Flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21 encountered a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport. All passengers were well attended to upon landing and no injuries were reported.The aircraft is undergoing inspection and maintenance, and will resume service once it receives the necessary clearances.""Although Pakistan airspace is shut for Indian carriers, aviation experts argue that emergency requests like the one made by the IndiGo pilot should not be refused in the interest of passenger safety.Aviation regulator DGCA has directed commercial airlines and charter and private jet operators to ensure aircraft window shades, barring those for emergency exit-row seats, are closed during take-off and landing at defence airports, “particularly those near the western border”.The rule is meant to “enhance operational safety and prevent unintentional sharing of security-related information by general public/crew”. Failure to comply will invite legal action, DGCA said.Pakistani drone and missile attacks in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor led to 32 airports in north, central and western India — including defence airbases with civil enclaves in Srinagar, Jammu, Leh, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Gwalior and Hindon — being shut for a few days. While operations at these airports have resumed, security concerns remain.“These instructions shall apply post opening of Indian airspace for commercial operations to all scheduled, scheduled commuter, and non-scheduled aircraft operating from defence airfields. All passenger window shades, where applicable, shall remain closed until the aircraft is airborne and has crossed an altitude of 10,000 feet during departure, or during arrival, after it descends below 10,000 feet and reaches the parking bay at the civil terminal,” the order states.In normal circumstances, safety protocol mandates all window shades remain open during take-off and landing. This is to ensure passengers and crew can assess external conditions, such as fires or debris, and identify exits in case of an emergency evacuation. DGCA order for civilian operations at defence airfields also bars photography.","IndiGo flight 6E2142 from Delhi to Srinagar hit severe mid-air turbulence due to a hailstorm.

Delhi HC reserves order on Celebi's security clearance withdrawal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-reserves-order-on-celebis-security-clearance-withdrawal/articleshow/121370711.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi high court reserved judgment Friday on a petition by Celebi Airport Services Private Ltd against a decision by the Centre's Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BACS) to withdraw the Turkiye company's security authorisation for ground handling operations at airports over national security concerns.A single-judge bench of Justice Sachin Datta reserved the judgment after listening to senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Celebi, and solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the central govt. The court requested all parties to submit written statements by Monday. The cancellation of Celebi's security clearance came in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor and Pakistan's retaliation that included use of Turkish weapons.Rohatgi argued that principles of natural justice were breached, as Celebi received neither prior notice nor information about govt's intended actions. The decision violated Rule 12 of the Aircrafts Security Rules, 2023, rendering it invalid. The rule stipulates that govt must provide an entity an opportunity to present its case before suspending security clearance. Any suspension requires documented justification and cannot exceed one year.Cancellation is permitted only on reasonable grounds of national security, civil aviation security, or over non-compliance with security conditions.Rohatgi contended that Centre was not endowed with plenary powers, as it claimed to, and it was not open for govt to say it could be in breach of its own rules of granting an opportunity of hearing while revoking security clearance.Celebi urged the HC not to examine materials provided to it in a sealed cover until the firm was given a gist of the allegations it faced. Emphasising the firm ought to have been put on notice before govt's action, Rohatgi said: ""Notice has to say the proposed punishment based on the gravamen of the facts...

The agency initiated investigation under PMLA against JIL and JAL based on multiple FIRs registered by the economic offences wing of Delhi Police and UP Police on complaints filed by hundreds of homebuyers of Jaypee Wish Town and other projects of JIL.A senior officer said ED is looking into an alleged ""fraud with homebuyers and investors of around Rs 12,000 crore and siphoning off and diversion of funds"". The former promoters of JIL and JAL are under the scanner while JIL's present owner Suraksha Realty could provide documents available with the company as it is under its control now.A spokesperson for Suraksha told TOI that ""it is a mistaken identity as we have not done any sale or purchase, except construction of the projects"".He denied that Suraksha was in any way involved in bank borrowings related to the project. There was no response from Manoj Gaur, the former director of JIL.The investigation is primarily focused on the alleged frauds by promoters of Jaypee Wish Town, who began selling flats in 2010-11 and were to deliver these within three years. In 2017, several FIRs were filed against the promoters of JIL after homebuyers held demonstrations against police inaction in registering a case against the builder who had collected money from them, and allegedly diverted it to other projects, leading to delay in delivery of thousands of flats.Many of the homebuyers had put their life savings in Jaypee Infratech projects in Wish Town in Noida and other places, the scheduled delivery of which was to begin in 2013-15 but are pending even today. Jaypee Infratech Ltd, now under Suraksha Realty, has pushed the deadline to deliver possession of more than 10,000 flats from June 2026 to Dec 2028.

NEW DELHI: India will make a strong case to put Pakistan back on the Financial Action Task Force 'grey list' at its next meeting in June and highlight Islamabad's failure to comply with anti-money laundering and terror financing rules, a govt source told TOI on Friday. India will also oppose a World Bank funding plan for Pakistan, which is also scheduled for discussion in June, the source said, adding Islamabad had used funds from multilateral agencies to buy arms.The source said India will present a dossier to the watchdog detailing how Pakistan had failed to comply with the rules.Against the backdrop of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan post Pahalgam massacre, New Delhi has mounted a global offensive against Pakistan, which it has accused of backing terrorists.After Pakistan was placed in FATF 'grey list' in 2018, it had promised to submit an action plan to curb money laundering and terror financing. It had also talked about enacting a law, which it has failed to do so far. In Oct 2022, FATF had announced that Pakistan had been removed from its 'grey list' as it had largely completed its action plans.Removal from the 'grey list' enables a country to have greater access to foreign loans and aid.When FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring and this is referred to as the 'grey list'.World Bank is expected to review a $20 billion funding for Pakistan under the 10-year country partnership framework that was announced in Jan this year.Earlier this month, India had strongly objected to IMF, which approved a $2.3 billion loan to Pakistan under the extended fund facility lending programme ($1 billion) and a fresh resilience and sustainability facility lending plan of $1.3 billion.India abstained from voting as IMF rules do not permit a formal 'no' vote. India had conveyed its strong dissent within the constraints of the IMF's voting system and used the opportunity to formally record its objections. Source said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had spoken to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva and several European finance ministers expressing India's strong objection.""India is not averse to any country receiving money for development. But IMF funding was not the right thing to do at a time when there were border tensions between India and Pakistan and a situation of war. Also, Pakistan has a history of spending not for people, but for buying arms,"" the source said.After India's sustained objection, IMF has imposed 11 strict conditions on Pakistan on several parameters linked to fiscal, governance, social, monetary and financial parameters along with metrics to be met in energy sector and trade, investment policy and deregulation.Sources citing public data said Pakistan spends on average around 18% of its general budget on ""defence affairs and services"", while even conflict-affected countries spend on average far less (10-14% of their general budget expenditure). Sources pointed out that Pakistan's arms imports increased from 1980 to 2023 by over 20% on average in the years when it received IMF disbursements compared to years when it did not receive such funds.","India will make a strong case to put Pakistan back on the Financial Action Task Force 'grey list' at its next meeting in June.

""The strikes were over in minutes. No civilian or military installation in Pakistan was touched. We were convinced that the May 8 strikes on the terror bases in Pakistan were enough to avenge the Pahalgam attack,"" he shared. ""But Pakistan retaliated with an audacious attempt to target our civilian settlements and military facilities after May 8. These did no harm as our air defence system is infallible. On May 9, India gave Pakistan a befitting and stern response by hitting airbases on their side; this showcased our strike capabilities, while exposing Pakistan's hollow air defence systems.""Stating that even on May 9, India did not target civilian areas in Pakistan, Shah said this sets apart India's retaliation from anti-terror actions elsewhere in the world.""When Pakistan-based terror hideouts were hit, the response came from Pakistan army. Pakistan Army brass was seen attending the namaaz-e- janaaza of the terrorists killed,"" Shah said. ""What Pakistan had been denying all along, it is now for the world to see - that terror in India is Pakistan-sponsored.""""Operation Sindoor has earned global praise not only for the strike capabilities of Indian armed forces but also their restraint.

Indigo, Air India Cancel Flights Amid Drone Scare Even After Ceasefire | Is Flying Still Safe?

NEW DELHI: The pilot operating IndiGo ’s Delhi-Srinagar flight on Wednesday had sought Lahore air traffic control (ATC) permission to briefly venture into Pakistan airspace to avoid turbulence after encountering a sudden hailstorm.People in the know say Lahore ATC denied this permission and pilot flying the Airbus A321 with 220 people on board declared emergency to Srinagar ATC. The aircraft with over 220 people on board, including Trinamool Congress MPs, finally landed safely in Srinagar but with its radome or nose cone badly damaged in the hailstorm.A senior Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said, “We have sought details from IndiGo” and a probe is on. The aircraft (VT-IMD) is now grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being widely applauded for handling the situation well and ensuring everyone’s safety.In a statement, the airline said: “IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21, 2025, navigated a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport. All customers were attended to upon landing and no injuries were reported. The aircraft is currently undergoing necessary inspection and maintenance in Srinagar and will resume operations once all clearances have been secured.We sincerely thank our customers for their cooperation in ensuring the safe completion of this flight. As always, the safety of our customers and crew remains our highest priority.”The plane had taken off from Delhi at 5 pm on Wednesday and landed in Srinagar safely at 6.46 pm. While Pakistan airspace remains closed for Indian aircraft, in emergency circumstances such permission as sought by the IndiGo pilot should not have been denied for a commercial airline due to safety reasons, say multiple senior pilots.","Lahore ATC refused IndiGo Delhi-Srinagar pilot request to enter airspace & avoid turbulence: Sources.

Govt on Waqf Act in SC: Proof of being Muslim in sync with Sharia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-on-waqf-act-in-sc-proof-of-being-muslim-in-sync-with-sharia/articleshow/121348573.cms,"No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 Act: Raj govt to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order.

Supporting healthy longevity with modern science





In a world where everyone searches for the secret to living a long and fulfilling life, the wisdom of those who have actually achieved extraordinary longevity is invaluable. Ethel Caterham, the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115, offers a simple yet powerful insight into how she has managed to live such a remarkable life. Born in 1909, Ethel has witnessed immense global changes—from world wars to technological revolutions—and through it all, she has maintained a philosophy that has kept her peaceful, healthy, and vibrant. Her secret? One straightforward rule that she believes has helped her live over a century: “Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.” This rule, rooted in calmness and self-respect, reveals much about the connection between emotional well-being and longevity.When asked about her secret to living beyond a century, Ethel’s answer was refreshingly simple: avoiding arguments and listening more. She said,This philosophy centers on emotional calmness and self-control, avoiding unnecessary conflicts that can drain energy and increase stress.Scientific research confirms the wisdom in Ethel’s words. Chronic stress and emotional turmoil are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, weakened immune function, and accelerated aging.By choosing to avoid arguments, Ethel likely protected her body and mind from these harmful effects, creating an environment where health and happiness could flourish.Ethel Caterham was born on August 21, 1909, in the village of Shipton Bellinger, England. Growing up as the second youngest in a family of eight siblings, her early years were shaped by simplicity and traditional values. Life at that time was markedly different — horse-drawn carriages, handwritten letters, and a world on the brink of World War I.Despite the many historical upheavals she experienced, Ethel maintained a steady and calm disposition throughout her life. This ability to remain composed and adaptable was a foundation that supported her health and longevity.Emotional health is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in overall longevity. Studies show that people who manage their emotions well and maintain stable, positive relationships tend to live longer and healthier lives. Chronic emotional conflict can lead to inflammation in the body, which is associated with many age-related diseases.Ethel’s ability to listen and remain composed reflects an emotional resilience that scientific studies link to longevity. By conserving her energy for positive experiences rather than arguments, she helped her body maintain a healthier internal balance.Ethel’s long life was also marked by boldness and curiosity. At 18, she traveled to India to work as a nanny, embracing new cultures and challenges. Later, she lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband, a British army major. These experiences likely enriched her life and kept her mentally engaged, another important factor linked to healthy aging.Despite frequent moves and changes, Ethel’s calm demeanor never wavered. She raised two daughters in the UK and continued to live with strength and grace, even after the loss of her husband.Ethel recently celebrated her 115th birthday in the warm company of friends, family, and caregivers. More than just a milestone, her journey reminds us that living a long life is not only about the years but also about how they are lived. Her story shows that inner peace, emotional stability, and finding joy in everyday moments are key to lasting well-being and longevity.While we cannot all control our genetics or the eras we live through, Ethel’s simple rule offers actionable wisdom:Ethel’s philosophy aligns with scientific recommendations for longevity, which emphasize emotional health alongside physical health. Regular exercise, hydration, stress management, a balanced diet, and strong social connections are all essential. Emotional calmness and happiness have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and improve overall life satisfaction.","World’s oldest woman, 115 years old, swears by this one rule for a long life. “Never argue with anyone.

'I Settled It Trough Trade': Donald Trump Once Again Claims Credit for India Pakistan Ceasefire Deal

Why did stock market fall today? Top reasons

1) Treasury Yields in United States

2) US Fiscal Issues Following Moody's Assessment

3) Subdued U.S. Bond Performance

4) Market Adjustment Post Strong Gains

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , tanked in trade on Thursday. While Nifty50 went below 24,550, BSE Sensex was down over 1,100 points intraday. Nifty50 ended at 24,609.70, down 204 points or 0.82%. BSE Sensex closed at 80,951.99, down 645 points or 0.79%. The stock markets reflected the global market weakness due to higher bond yields and US debt issues.Among Sensex companies, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Tech Mahindra, Power Grid, ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Reliance Industries and Maruti were the major losers.IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel and UltraTech Cement showed positive performance.""The key benchmark indices witnessed declines amid US fiscal concerns that the proposed budget bill could significantly increase the national debt, pushing US treasury yields higher due to tepid long-term bond demand. Adding to the pressure, a major credit rating agency's downgrade of the US credit outlook sparked broad-based selloffs across Asian markets,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said.Long-term US Treasury yields reached peak levels not seen since 18 months ago. The 30-year Treasury bond yield stayed above 5% following an 18-month peak during Asian trading hours.The elevated yields are causing funds to shift away from stocks, particularly affecting emerging economies such as India.The financial community remains cautious after Moody's reduced the United States' credit rating last Friday, pointing to the nation's escalating debt obligations. This credit assessment has led to increased global caution, affecting both American and Asian financial markets.Financial observers are monitoring the proposed taxation legislation, scheduled for voting this week, which analysts suggest could increase American debt by $3.8 trillion, on top of the existing $36 trillion.""The fundamental issue is the high fiscal deficit of the US, which the market feels is unsustainable,"" said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.A lacklustre response to Wednesday's $16 billion auction of 20-year bonds demonstrated investors' hesitation towards U.S. assets, resulting in elevated yields.""The weak US 20-year bond auction and the spike in yields of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds indicate the declining confidence in US bonds,"" Vijayakumar said.This impacted Asian markets negatively, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan declining 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei decreased 0.7% due to yen appreciation. Chinese benchmark indices reduced by 0.2%, whilst Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.8% during early trading.In the previous session, the Dow declined 1.9%, S&P 500 fell 1.6%, and Nasdaq decreased 1.4% following the disappointing bond auction.Sameet Chavan, Head of Research (Technical and Derivative) at Angel One, observed that recent substantial gains have led to overbought market conditions, with values significantly exceeding short-term moving averages. Despite an overall positive trend, a period of stabilisation is likely in the immediate future. ""A sustained move below the recent matching lows near 24,700 could trigger further profit booking, potentially dragging prices towards 24,600 and the 20-day EMA near 24,500,"" he added.","Nifty50 ended at 24,609.70, down 204 points or 0.82%. BSE Sensex closed at 80,951.99, down 645 points or0.79%.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

iPhone's US manufacturing remains unlikely

A big Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025, as the tech giant navigates mounting pressure from President Trump to shift production away from the the country. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who maintains a $270 price target and Outperform rating on Apple stock, called the Trump administration's 90-day tariff pause ""a dream scenario"" for the company. By this fall, Ives believes Apple ""could manufacture 60% to 65% of its smartphones in India,"" citing his ""high level of confidence"" that the iPhone maker is accelerating its manufacturing transfer to the South Asian country.The prediction comes amid escalating tensions between Apple and the Trump administration over the company's India operations.

I don't want you building in India.""Despite presidential pressure, Ives suggests Apple retains strategic options. The company ""could easily pivot back to a China driven iPhone strategy,"" he noted, with actions dependent ""on the tariff situation and deal negotiations.""Apple has reportedly reassured the Indian government there will be ""no change"" in its investment plans, even as Trump publicly urged the company to increase US. production. The tech giant manufactured approximately $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the year ending March 2025, representing a 60% increase from the previous year.However, Ives dismisses the possibility of significant American iPhone production, stating there is ""no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US. in the near term."" The analyst warns that US.-manufactured iPhones would cost consumers around $3,500 due to supply chain complexities and manufacturing costs.Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn continues expanding its Indian operations with a $1.5 billion investment, planning to produce 25-30 million iPhones at its India plants in 2025, more than doubling last year's output.","Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025.

Severe weather in Delhi-NCR disrupted air travel

Cyclonic system behind the storm

No injuries, but a frightening Experience

In a harrowing mid-air episode on May 21, 2025, IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged. The Airbus A321, carrying 227 passengers, was battered by sudden turbulence that sparked panic in the cabin. A now-viral video from inside the aircraft captured terrified passengers, including children, screaming as the plane shook intensely and lightning flashed outside. The pilot declared an emergency but managed to land the aircraft safely in Srinagar around 6:30 PM. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the aircraft has since been grounded for inspection.Although IndiGo did not initially confirm the extent of the damage, viral photos have revealed that the aircraft's nose cone suffered significant structural damage. The damage is consistent with impact from large hailstones during the flight’s traversal of the storm system. The aircraft has since been grounded at Srinagar Airport for thorough inspection and repairs.The footage, widely circulated on social media, shows passengers in a state of fear and confusion as the aircraft shudders violently mid-air. Screams and cries from children dominate the audio, while flashes of lightning are visible through the windows. The cabin crew is seen attempting to maintain calm and ensure passenger safety as the aircraft fights through the intense weather.According to airline officials, the pilot of flight 6E 2142 reported an emergency to Srinagar Air Traffic Control upon encountering the hailstorm. Despite the hazardous conditions, the flight landed safely at approximately 6:30 PM. IndiGo stated that all protocols were followed and that the airport team attended to passengers' needs upon arrival.The incident coincided with a powerful storm that swept across Delhi-NCR on Wednesday evening, with wind speeds reaching up to 79 kmph. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported 12.2 mm of rainfall at Safdarjung between 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM. The sudden weather shift disrupted flight operations at Delhi Airport, left Metro services stranded, and caused chaos across the region.IMD attributed the turbulent weather to a cyclonic circulation over Haryana, embedded in a larger trough extending from Punjab to Bangladesh. Moisture influx from both the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal intensified the system, resulting in hailstorms and gusty winds across northern India.While there were no physical injuries reported among the 227 passengers, many described the experience as deeply unsettling. Trinamool Congress MPs, who were reportedly on board, later referred to the incident as a ""near-death experience."" IndiGo emphasized that customer well-being was prioritised upon landing.This incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictability of weather patterns and the challenges faced by pilots and crew during extreme conditions. While no one was harmed, the mental toll and the visible damage to the aircraft highlight the seriousness of such mid-air encounters.","IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged.

MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million fund with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership. His main channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube in June 2024.In related news, MrBeast shared an invitation to Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. Shared on X during the Indian Premier League (IPL), the post rapidly went viral, accumulating nearly 600K views, a testament to Kohli's universal recognition. “@imVkohli Hey!

"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-61000-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-and-crowdstrike-reshape-workforce/articleshow/121359700.cms,"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce

Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut across more than 130 companies



Key stats (as of May 2025):

Total layoffs: 61,300+ employees

Companies involved: 130+

Sectors affected: Cloud computing, advertising, HR, devices, software engineering, sales

Microsoft: Streamlining leadership, prioritising engineers

Why Microsoft made the cuts:

Restructuring leadership layers to promote a flatter hierarchy

Investing more in engineering and product development

Optimizing global workforce by reducing duplication of roles

Google: Quiet workforce shifts behind the scenes

Strategic workforce realignment:

Focused layoffs across revenue-generating units

Elimination of redundant roles tied to aging product lines

A shift towards automation and generative AI technologies in advertising and consumer search

Amazon: Scaling back devices and emerging tech divisions

Behind Amazon’s cuts:

A realignment of priorities in consumer devices

Slower growth and usage rates of Alexa and Kindle platforms

Budget reallocation to cloud computing (AWS) and logistics optimization

CrowdStrike: Cutting 5% to focus on profitability

CrowdStrike’s layoff strategy:

Streamlining customer success and non-core support roles

Enhancing operating efficiency with AI-based threat detection tools

Reinvesting in international market expansion and enterprise sales

IBM: AI replaces jobs, but also creates new ones

IBM’s AI-driven workforce transition:

Use of AI automation in HR, reducing the need for traditional roles

Reinvestment in high-growth areas like quantum computing and hybrid cloud

Emphasis on reskilling and upskilling internal employees

Why are these layoffs happening? The 3 core reasons



1. Macroeconomic volatility

Global economic conditions remain unstable. Geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures have compelled tech companies to cut costs and bolster margins.

2. Post-pandemic growth corrections

During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech companies saw unprecedented growth and scaled their teams rapidly. As demand normalizes, many are right-sizing their workforces to match slower, more sustainable growth trajectories.

3. The AI revolution

Perhaps the most transformative factor is the rise of artificial intelligence. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot have already replaced or reduced the need for certain roles in coding, content creation, customer service, and HR. Companies are now prioritizing automation over expansion, leading to widespread redundancy across job functions that once required large teams.

What it means for the future of tech work

Emerging trends:

Fewer administrative layers, more direct reporting structures

Higher demand for AI literacy, even in non-technical roles

Greater reliance on contractors and fractional talent

Emphasis on remote and flexible work, with fewer full-time hires

Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025 — not solely due to innovation, but because of the sweeping workforce restructuring taking place across the industry. From global giants like Microsoft , Google , and Amazon to specialized cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike , companies are reducing headcounts in significant numbers. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous downturns driven by financial collapses or market crashes, this wave is propelled by three powerful forces: slowing post-pandemic revenue growth, persistent global economic uncertainty, and, most notably, the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in core business operations.These layoffs signal a broader transformation in how tech firms are responding to modern pressures. Rather than merely cutting costs, many are strategically reorganizing their internal structures, accelerating AI-driven automation, and reallocating resources toward long-term innovation and profitability.According to the data from Layoffs.fri, as of May 2025, over 61,000 workers have been laid off in the tech industry — a continuation of a trend that began in 2022 and escalated dramatically in 2023. Companies are now more strategic in their announcements, often avoiding large headlines by issuing smaller, staggered job cuts throughout the year. Still, the cumulative effect has created deep uncertainty among tech professionals worldwide.The layoffs are not restricted to startups or mid-size firms; the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike — are among the most significant contributors to this tally. Let’s examine how each is navigating this reshuffling of talent and operations.In one of the largest individual cuts of the year, Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, with nearly 2,000 roles eliminated in Washington state alone. This marked the company’s most substantial layoff since 2023. The job reductions span several business units, including support, administration, and middle management.According to an internal memo, the company is making these changes to “improve clarity of decision-making and better align teams with strategic priorities.” The layoff announcement also came with news of increased investment in AI-powered enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure.While Google hasn't made a single large-scale layoff announcement in 2025, it has been silently trimming its workforce across multiple departments. In May alone, 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization (GBO) — a team that handles advertising sales and partner engagement. These cuts follow earlier reductions in the Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud.Google’s restructuring is part of a broader initiative to recalibrate its business model in the face of AI-led disruption in search and advertising, two of its most lucrative verticals. Rather than hiring aggressively, the company is being more selective, favoring AI talent over traditional business development roles.Amazon announced in April that it would cut around 100 jobs in its Devices and Services division, which includes Alexa, Kindle, and Zoox — its autonomous vehicle subsidiary.Amazon has long treated its devices division as an innovation lab. However, as pressure mounts to deliver profitability in every business line, the company is scaling back on experimental divisions and concentrating on proven revenue drivers like AWS and Prime logistics.Even high-growth cybersecurity companies aren’t immune. CrowdStrike announced layoffs impacting 5% of its global workforce, citing a shift towards long-term profitability amid rising costs and market volatility.CrowdStrike's decision is especially noteworthy as cybersecurity remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. Yet even here, automation and AI are allowing firms to do more with fewer people, reducing the need for large support teams.IBM represents a hybrid approach to workforce management in the age of AI. While the company laid off several hundred employees, mostly from HR and administrative roles, it also announced new hiring plans focused on engineering, programming, and enterprise sales.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been vocal about the company’s “AI-first” strategy, noting that while automation will eliminate certain roles, it will also create new demand for technical talent, especially in sectors where human insight remains essential.While the specifics vary by company, the underlying causes of the 2025 tech layoffs can be traced to three interwoven trends:The 2025 layoff wave is more than just a cost-cutting exercise — it is a strategic rebalancing of what work looks like in the digital economy. The shift isn’t just about reducing headcount; it’s about reshaping the types of roles that matter most.","Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike are among the most significant contributors to this tally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121360366,imgsize-148498,width-400,resizemode-4/Tech-layoffs-2025-Over-61000-jobs-cut-as-Microsoft-Google-Amazon-and-CrowdStrike-reshape-workforce.jpg"

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines. Musk quoted a post by DOGE aka the Department of Government Efficiency which revealed that nearly 20% of the phone lines at a federal agency were unused. DOGE shared a post on X that reads “Unused phone lines! Of the 1048 @USOPM phone lines, 198 (19%) were either unused or duplicated.”It further added: “OPM (Office of Personnel Management) cancelled these lines (took 1 hour), resulting in ~$100k/yr in savings. Since OPM is ~0.1% of the federal government, this suggests that ~$100M/yr is wasted on unused lines”.The tech billionaire responded to the post, statingThe revelation could have broader implications for telecom providers supplying services to federal agencies. According to a 2023 Washington Post report, only 2% of U.S. adults use landlines exclusively. As legacy landline usage continues to decline—the cost and necessity of maintaining unused infrastructure is under increasing scrutiny.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed regulations that had previously required telecom providers to run copper landline connections to every home. The move marked a significant shift toward modernizing telecommunications infrastructure in favor of wireless and fiber-optic networks.According to a report, Verizon Communications Inc. remains the dominant landline service provider in the Northeastern United States, maintaining a strong regional presence even as overall landline use continues to decline nationwide.In a related news, Musk shared a 15-second clip of the US Vice President in conversation with Joe Rogan, where Vance said “You can say a lot of things about Elon Musk, but you can't say he's a dumb**s”. The two burst into laughter, as Rogan quipped, “You get dunked on by one of the smartest guys alive.”Musk shared the clip on his X timeline, responding with, ""Lmao,"" short for (Laughing My A** Off).",Tesla CEO Elon Musk highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines.

NEW DELHI: Delhi govt's next electric vehicle policy will focus on strengthening the city's charging infrastructure, job creation and faster adoption of green mobility. Sources in the transport department said that the next policy was likely to target setting up low-cost, fast EV charging stations at every five-kilometre stretch across the capital.The upcoming policy, expected to replace the current one, which was extended until mid-July, also aims to promote battery swapping facilities and offer attractive incentives for retrofitting EV kits and scrapping older vehicles.An official said that govt was also planning an EV corridor in the next policy. He added that the corridor could be alongside Outer Ring Road, considering its status as one of the city's most congested thoroughfares linking key destinations. He further stated that the charging stations would be strategically positioned beneath flyovers and on vacant plots to avoid disrupting traffic flow. The design will incorporate entry and exit points carefully planned to ensure minimal disturbance to motorists.The official said that the idea was to brand this as a route where finding an EV charging station would be easy. This will offset the range anxiety seen among new EV buyers.""This stretch also has several residential areas along its circular length.""Officials said the revamped EV strategy would prioritise employment generation, targeting the creation of at least 20,000 jobs. ""The establishment of a dense charging network and battery swapping ecosystem will be at the heart of this job drive,"" a senior govt official said.Since its introduction in 2020, Delhi's EV policy has played a pivotal role in pushing the city towards cleaner transport. It offers a wide range of subsidies, including Rs 5,000 per kWh of battery capacity (up to Rs 30,000) for electric two-wheelers, Rs 30,000 for e-rickshaws and e-carts, and Rs 5,500 or 25% of the cost for e-cycles. The current EV policy, introduced in 2020, has received multiple extensions, the latest one for three months after April 15, 2025. The policy offers a range of incentives, including a 25% purchase subsidy (up to Rs 5,500) for e-cycles, Rs 30,000 for e-rickshaws and e-carts, Rs 5,000 per kWh of battery capacity (capped at Rs 30,000) for two-wheelers, and Rs 30,000 for e-light commercial vehicles.Officials said that looking ahead to 2027, govt was aiming to achieve 95% electric vehicles among all new registrations, leading to a substantial reduction in urban pollution levels. The plan focuses on establishing comprehensive accessibility to charging stations and battery exchange facilities across the region.Recently, Delhi govt had also withdrawn a recommendation of the draft EV policy, which suggested the elimination of CNG autos and fossil fuel-powered two-wheelers in the coming years. The draft proposal suggested phasing out CNG-powered three-wheelers and replacing them with electric autos by Aug 2025. Similarly, it also suggested that petrol, diesel, and CNG two-wheeler registration won't be allowed from Aug 15, 2026. However, transport minister Pankaj Singh said there was no plan to make it binding for CNG autos to shift to electric or put any restriction on bikes.","Delhi govt's next electric vehicle policy will focus on strengthening the city's charging infrastructure, job creation and faster adoption of green mobility.

PUNE: Cadet Ishita Sharma stands at a pivotal moment, just eight days away from a significant milestone not just for her, but for the country.She is part of the first group of 17 women cadets who will graduate from the National Defence Academy (NDA) on May 30, along with around 300 male counterparts.The Indian Armed Forces, decided to admit women to the academy in June 2022.""I come from a non-military background. My parents work in the corporate sector, and my brother is an IT professional. I was pursuing a bachelor's degree in economics when the NDA announced its entry for women. I didn't think twice before applying,"" Ishita told TOI.The maiden graduating cadets share the common experience of stringent physical training, military routines, and strong bonds formed over three years at the academy. They echoed that a key aspect of their journey has been personal development, reflecting NDA's reputation for transforming young individuals into accomplished military personnel. Ishita added, ""After spending three years here, I can confidently say that my personality underwent a complete transformation. ""Achieving several accomplishments along the way, Ishita earned the honorary appointment of 'Division Cadet Captain' (DCC) for her outstanding performance in all areas of training.""This is how one gets the opportunity to become a leader right from the academy. It develops your leadership character naturally,"" she remarked.Her fellow graduating cadets echoed similar sentiments about their stint.""Before joining the academy, I was an introvert. Here, I made several friends for life. In fact, my course mates feel like family now. You form unbreakable bonds that last forever,"" Ishita said, speaking to TOI outside Sudan Block.The cadets emphasised that they never had to compete with their male counterparts for opportunities during their training - they received equal chances to excel.""Equal opportunity naturally empowers each individual. That is what makes the academy unique in all aspects,"" Ishita added.All cadets faced challenges in the initial stages. They worked hard on both physical fitness and overcoming mental barriers. For cadet Shriti Daksh, the first weeks at the academy brought about a stark realisation.""I understood what the real experience of military training feels like,"" said Shriti, the daughter of a retired Wing Commander, who was motivated to follow in her father's footsteps. ""I had no other dream or career plan than to join the Indian Armed Forces,"" she added.Shriti said, ""When the NDA opened its doors for girls, I was elated as I wanted to join the same academy from which my father graduated decades ago. It was a significant milestone for me personally. It was a special day for both my father and me when he dropped me off at the academy, a mix of nostalgia and pride for him. Now, I am just a few days away from the moment my father experienced in his life, and I am excited to share that moment with him on May 30. ""Balancing military training with academics has been one of the most challenging aspects for the cadets. They often feel pressed for time, as participation in various activities alongside their daily schedules tests their mental endurance. ""You are involved everywhere - from the drill square to the swimming pool to equestrian activities. So, maintaining a balance is the most difficult challenge we face. We are always short on time. That's the level of our schedule,"" Shriti explained.Ritul Duhan, the first Battalion Cadet Captain (BCC) from the group, is aware of the significant responsibility she carries.""We are not just completing our training; we are paving the way for future leadership and inspiring younger cadets who will follow our path,"" she said.Ritul lauded the academy's adaptation to integrate female cadets. ""The atmosphere has become increasingly conducive,"" she said, adding, ""I encourage girls to join with a broader purpose, understanding that this training develops every aspect of your personality.""","Ishita Sharma is part of the first group of 17 women cadets who will graduate from the National Defence Academy.

VADODARA: The milk you drink for sustenance could soon also fuel your car. Dairy major Amul has achieved success in its large-scale trial to produce bioethanol from whey, the component of milk left behind while making cheese and paneer.So far in India, ethanol has been produced from molasses, maize, farm waste or damaged foodgrain. With the success of this trial, India's largest dairy cooperative plans to invest Rs 70 crore in a bioethanol plant, producing 50,000 litres a day. It is also exploring the opportunity of working with existing bioethanol plants in Gujarat's sugar cooperatives sector.""To become more sustainable, we conducted a large-scale trial of bioethanol production from cheese/paneer whey. It aimed to upcycle and create a new revenue stream for our 3.6 million farmer-owners,"" Jayen Mehta, managing director of Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), told TOI.""From 4.5 lakh litres of cheese whey, we got 20,000 litres of rectified spirit with an ethanol content of 96.71%.""Mehta said, “This recovery rate of 4.4% can be raised to 8% in the future.Biogas (methane), dry ice and water are the byproducts of this process.”“This novel trial was conducted to bolster the Centre’s ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme, which aims to raise the blending of bioethanol in petrol to 20%” he said.The trial was conducted at the unit of Shree Narmada Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Ltd, the cooperative popularly called Narmada Sugar, at Dharikheda in Bharuch. Narmada Sugar is headed by Ghanshyam Patel, who is also chairman of Bharuch Dairy, a member union of GCMMF.Amul currently handles 3 million litres of whey each day.

VIJAYAWADA: A former coffee shop worker in Hyderabad and a daily wager in Guntur were allegedly used as frontmen by the powerful liquor mafia with political backing during the previous YSRCP govt in Andhra Pradesh.According to sources in the special investigation team (SIT), which is probing the alleged Rs 3,200 liquor scam in AP, the two individuals were made the faces of the scam, though the real perpetrators worked behind the scenes.The story of Purushottam Varun Kumar, who once brewed cappuccinos at a Hyderabad cafe, sounds like a plot of a high-octane political thriller - a modest engineering graduate struggling to make ends meet finds himself catapulted into the big league of the liquor trade, amassing wealth worth hundreds of crores in just five years, only to vanish without a trace.According to police sources, Varun, who completed his engineering degree in 2016, was unable to find a job in his field, and started working at a coffee shop in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad.It was there, sources said, that he met one Ramesh Reddy - a Telugu NRI settled in the United States, who was visiting India ahead of the 2019 general elections.Varun reportedly shared his aspirations to secure a lucrative job abroad. A few months later, he received a call from Ramesh, who was asking to meet him in Delhi.What followed 'changed' his life, and allegedly, turned him into a pawn in a multi-crore liquor network.Varun, who had a clean slate with no criminal record or political affiliations, was appointed as the operations in-charge of a distillery unit, first in Puducherry, and later across Andhra Pradesh.Within months, the distillery started aggressively pushing low-quality liquor brands. Despite their subpar quality, these brands dominated AP market, as they were backed by a tightly controlled distribution network. Investigators said Varun became the de facto face of the entire operations of the distillery. With an office in Ajit Singh Nagar of Vijayawada, he handled production to retail operations and, eventually, the financial flows. The SIT investigating the scam has unearthed a trail of shell companies used to siphon off hundreds of crores of rupees. According to preliminary findings, while Varun's name was used for several transactions, a significant portion of the money was routed to liquor mafia operatives. After the change of regime in 2024, the NDA govt in the state announced a full-fledged probe into the liquor scam. Soon after, Varun disappeared. Initial leads suggested he may have fled to the US. However, fresh inputs indicate he may be in Dubai. Investigators are using cyber forensics and scanning immigration data but have so far been unable to confirm his exact whereabouts. The SIT is also probing a parallel case involving a youngster from Guntur whose name was allegedly misused by the liquor mafia.Officials said a beer company dealership in AP was registered in his name without his knowledge. Hundreds of crores worth of beer were sold under his identity, and profits were laundered abroad.The youngster, now aware of the scale of the fraud, is reportedly in distress and seeking legal help."," Purushottam Varun Kumar, who once brewed cappuccinos at a Hyderabad cafe, sounds like a plot of a high-octane political thriller.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.
