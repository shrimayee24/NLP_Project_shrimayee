New Delhi: NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions and in nearly 35% of these cases, the vehicles were not at the toll plaza when the user fee was debited from FASTag wallet.Considering that such transactions happen due to manual entry of vehicle details by toll operators because of some issue, the road transport ministry is mulling doing away with this option completely.In a written reply, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari informed the Lok Sabha Thursday that National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), which provides the Central Clearing House (CCH) services of electronic toll collection , ""has reported 17.6 lakh transactions where refunds were made due to incorrect user fee (toll) deductions from Jan-2025 to Dec-2025 out of a total of 464 crore FASTag transactions"".This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, ""Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn't happen. A decision will be likely taken soon on stopping the practice of manually feeding vehicle registration numbers in the system to deduct toll. In such cases, there is a possibility of the toll attendants noting down wrong details. This becomes an unnecessary hassle for commuters.""The ministry said that with the implementation of FASTag, the average time taken to cross toll plaza has reduced to 40 seconds compared with the earlier 12.2 minutes per vehicle under the manual tolling system.In a separate written reply to a question on the total toll collection, the road transport ministry said in the past three quarters of the financial year 2025-26, Rs 50,195 crore was collected as user fee across the national highway and expressway network.During the entire last financial year, Rs 61,508 crore was collected as toll, the ministry further said.","NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions.

Stop Loss: 340,000

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

MCX Gold, on the weekly timeframe, continues to demonstrate healthy bullish momentum following a decisive breakout from a brief consolidation phase and is presently trading near its all-time high of 164,900. The upside bias is firmly established, with minimal evidence of a trend reversal, indicating that the advance is likely to stay toward higher levels. The recent acceleration further confirms the strength and sustainability of the move, while the broader outlook remains constructive as long as prices sustain above the weekly low.From a weekly perspective, the 157,500 zone emerges as a key support level, representing the recent lows of the previous week. Any retracement toward this area is likely to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this level preserves the bullish market structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well poised to advance toward the 185,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective upside is in harmony with the broader bullish trend and underlines the strength of prevailing market momentum.Additionally, the development of higher highs and higher lows over the week further reinforces positive sentiment, setting the stage for a sustained upward trajectory.Overall, gold maintains an optimistic bias, with the broader technical framework decisively favouring trend continuation. As long as prices remain firmly above the critical 157,500 support level, the bullish formation remains intact. Supported by robust momentum indicators and a favourable market sentiment backdrop, the metal appears well positioned to extend its advance in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has registered new all-time highs for the fifth consecutive week, extending a well-established sequence of higher highs that has persisted for several months. With little evidence of momentum decline, the overall bias remains decisively positive, and any corrective pullbacks are likely to attract renewed buying interest. We recommend positioning in line with the prevailing trend, which remains firmly bullish, while refraining from positions that go against this strong upward momentum.Silver’s early-week rally has underscored a resurgence in trend strength, enhancing the prospects for additional upside. Provided prices continue to hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias should remain intact. The immediate key support is located around the 340,000 zone, which may offer an attractive accumulation opportunity. Any retracement toward this area is likely to draw fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices and preserve upward momentum.On the upside, silver appears well positioned to test the 415,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This anticipated move reflects a continuation of the current bullish phase, supported by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly anchored above the 340,000 support level, silver is expected to maintain its bullish trend, with considerable scope for further appreciation as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold and silver are moving to newer highs, and the bullish momentum is likely to continue in the coming sessions as well, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Supreme Court Halts New UGC Equity Regulations On Caste Definition, Seeks Centre’s Reply By March

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday put on hold the controversial UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, taking serious exception to several of its provisions and saying that these could fuel societal division and have a dangerous impact on the goal of a casteless society.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi heard three petitions and said that while implementation of the 2026 regulations would be on hold till further orders, the 2012 regulations would continue to be in force to address grievances relating to caste-based discrimination against students on campuses of educational institutions.""We are sorry to say, the Regulations, prima facie, the language is completely vague, the provisions are capable of being misused, and the language needs to be re-modulated and redesigned,"" the bench said and asked for the setting up of an experts panel to examine the regulations.Terming the new regulations as regressive, the CJI said, ""In the country, after 75 years, whatever we have gained to move towards the goal of casteless society, are we enacting a regressive policy? No doubt, there has to be some effective mechanism to deal with caste-based discrimination.""The justices said that while they were all for regulations for creation of ""a free, inclusive and an equitable atmosphere in Universities....there are four or five serious concerns about the Regulations. If those are not addressed, the Regulations will otherwise have sweeping consequences that will divide society and lead to many dangerous impacts on the country.""The CJI flagged another provision in the regulations as problematic, pointing out that it proposed separate hostels based on the caste of students. ""For God's sake, please do not do that. In hostels, students from every community live together. There are inter-caste marriages also. We should move towards a casteless society by assimilating students of all regions and (students of) all castes must have equal rights and live harmoniously in universities. We cannot go backwards. There must not be any segregation.""The hearing took place amid agitation by sections of upper caste students against the regulations for allegedly being discriminatory and exclusionary and for being oblivious to the changed socio-economic milieu where newly empowered OBCs have also been accused of discriminating against others, including those from upper castes.Significantly, the OBCs are not under the purview of the 2012 regulations which snap back in action after the SC's order on Thursday.Leading the arguments for petitioners, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the Regulations presume that only a certain category of students belonging to certain castes face discrimination in universities. They keep general category candidates outside their purview, leaving such students without remedies for discrimination faced by them.Asking Centre and UGC to respond to the petitions by March 19, the bench said, ""We want to examine the constitutional validity and legality of 2026 Regulations. We would like the Union govt, with the concurrence and approval of the court, to constitute a panel of experts comprising eminent academicians and scholars who understand our social conditions to study the regulations and its possible impacts.""The regulations deal only with caste-based discrimination and presume that India is divided on basis of caste and do not deal with issues like ragging, North-South divide, cultural diversity, which too lead to discrimination, the petitioners said.The CJI Kant-led bench said, ""Ragging is the worst thing that happens on campuses. Children coming from south India to north India and vice-versa, and from north-east to other states of the country, carry their cultural values with them.""","Supreme Court Halts New UGC Equity Regulations On Caste Definition, Seeks Centre’s Reply By March 19.

Smithsonian museum to return 3 bronzes to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smithsonian-museum-to-return-3-bronzes-to-india/articleshow/127733435.cms,"Museums abroad are increasingly confronting the legacy of looted cultural heritage in their collections, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art has become the latest institution to act. On Wednesday, the museum announced it will return three sculptures to India after rigorous research revealed the sculptures had been removed illegally from temples in Tamil Nadu The sculptures 'Shiva Nataraja' (Chola period, ca. 990), 'Somaskanda' (Chola period, 12th century) and 'Saint Sundarar with Paravai' (Vijayanagar period, 16th century) are examples of the rich artistry of South Indian bronze casting.The Indian govt has agreed to place the 'Shiva Nataraja' on long-term loan. This arrangement will allow the museum to publicly share the full story of the object's origins, removal and return. It will be on view as part of the exhibition 'The Art of Knowing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Himalayas.'As part of a systematic review of its South Asian collections, the National Museum of Asian Art undertook a detailed investigation into the provenance of the three sculptures, scrutinizing each work's transaction history.In 2023, in collaboration with the Photo Archives of the French Institute of Pondicherry, museum researchers confirmed that the bronzes had been photographed in temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959. The Archaeological Survey of India subsequently reviewed these findings and affirmed the sculptures had been removed in violation of Indian laws.""The National Museum of Asian Art is committed to stewarding cultural heritage responsibly and advancing transparency in our collection,"" said museum director Chase F Robinson.The Shiva Nataraja belonged to the Sri Bhava Aushadesvara Temple in Thanjavur district, where it was photographed in 1957. The bronze was later acquired by the National Museum of Asian Art from Doris Wiener Gallery in New York in 2002. A researcher at the museum determined that the Doris Wiener Gallery had provided falsified documentation to facilitate the sale to the museum. The Somaskanda and Saint Sundarar with Paravai was part of a gift of 1,000 objects. Research showed that it was from the Visvanatha Temple in Alattur village, Mannarkudi taluk, and the Saint Sundarar with Paravai at the Shiva Temple was from Veerasolapuram village, Kallakuruchchi taluk.","Sculptures were removed from temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General K Sanjay Murthy on Thursday raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and slow down industrial growth.“MSMEs-related reforms need to cut across multiple departments and levels of government — Centre, state, and local bodies,” Murthy said, and added that the effectiveness of reforms depends not only on policy intent, but on the coordination among departments, digital system integration, uniformity in implementation, and citizen and business feedback loops.The CAG’s remarks came while addressing a gathering of senior officials from the Centre and states from departments of MSMEs, statistics and industry representatives from CII, FICCI, Assocham, Phdcci and Fisme on auditor’s ongoing pan-India audit of ease of doing business for MSMEs.“We need a four-pronged strategy of simplification, digitalisation, decriminalisation, and elimination of redundant laws — all of which are highly relevant for MSMEs,” he said. The CAG said that ease of doing business and ease of living have become priority audits for the federal auditor, cutting across departments, geographies and sectors.The meeting was part of the auditor’s consultative process for its pan-India horizontal audit on ease of doing business (EoDB) for MSMEs being undertaken.Murthy further said that while the Centre has embarked on a comprehensive initiative to promote EoDB through systematic compliance reduction and deregulation, the real test of reforms lies in the last-mile outcomes. “The audit seeks to assess whether systems are delivering what they ought to,” he said.Murthy said “the MSME sector is not only critical for economic growth, but also for inclusive development, supporting entrepreneurship, strengthening supply chains, and creating livelihoods across rural and urban India”.The pan-India horizontal audit is outcome-oriented public sector auditing, aligned with national priorities and focused on improving service delivery for MSMEs. It will cover the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26, with field audits. The insights from this audit are expected to support governments in refining reforms, reducing compliance burdens and creating a more predictable, transparent and facilitative business environment, enabling MSMEs to focus on productivity, innovation and growth, according to CAG.eom..","Comptroller and Auditor General K Sanjay Murthy raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) The CAG’s remarks came while addressing a gathering of senior officials from the Centre and states from departments of MSMEs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127783588,imgsize-152276,width-400,resizemode-4/127783588.jpg"
Coking coal notified as 'critical and strategic mineral',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coking-coal-notified-as-critical-and-strategic-mineral/articleshow/127783502.cms,".

NEW DELHI: With demand for imported coking coal—an essential input for the steel industry—continuing to rise despite large domestic reserves, the govt on Thursday notified coking coal as a “critical and strategic mineral” to accelerate exploration and mining activities, including those involving deep-seated deposits.The decision was made on the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Implementation of Viksit Bharat Goals and policy inputs from NITI Aayog, which recognised the strategic role of coking coal in ensuring mineral security and meeting the needs of domestic steel sector.Officials said India has an estimated 37.4 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand, with Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh also having deposits.Despite this domestic availability, imports of coking coal increased from 51.2 million tonnes in 2020–21 to 57.6 million tonnes in 2024–25, meeting about 95% of the steel sector’s requirements.To address this continued dependence on imports, coal (including coking coal) has been included in Part D of the First Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which lists critical and strategic minerals.The mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and allows the use of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation—measures expected to encourage greater private sector participation.The reform is expected to reduce import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for steel sector and support the objectives of National Steel Policy. It is also likely to promote private investment in exploration and beneficiation, encourage the adoption of advanced mining technologies and generate employment across the mining, logistics and steel value chain.","India has an estimated 37.4 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand.

Dutt added that coal underpins India’s development needs and will continue to do so even as renewables scale up alongside climate commitments.According to the Economic Survey 2025–26, coal plays an important role in India’s energy landscape, contributing 55% to the national energy mix and fuelling over 74% of total power generation. India’s total installed power generation capacity currently stands at nearly 514 gigawatts (GW), comprising about 247 GW of thermal capacity. Annual per capita energy consumption currently stands at 1,460 kWh and is expected to increase to 2,000 kWh by 2030 and over 4,000 kWh by 2047.Highlighting the global perspective, Kyle Haustveit, Assistant Secretary for Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, emphasised that coal remains critical for energy security worldwide.“Coal powered the modern world and it is not going away. Reliable, affordable and secure energy matters, and coal provides that stability, regardless of weather or market volatility,” he said. He highlighted the strong potential for India–US collaboration in clean coal technologies, coal gasification, carbon utilisation, and trade in high-quality metallurgical coal.Chairman-cum-Managing Director of Coal India Limited, B. Sairam, said coal will act as a bridge and enabler in India’s transition. “India’s per capita energy consumption is barely a third of that in developed economies. As this demand triples, coal will provide firm, dispatchable power while renewables and storage mature,” he said.","Coal will continue to play a central role in India’s energy mix. Annual per capita energy consumption currently stands at 1,460 kWh. This is expected to increase to 2,000 kWh by 2030 and over 4,000 kW by 2047.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127783558,imgsize-66896,width-400,resizemode-4/127783558.jpg"
Centre to test RBI-enabled digital food coupons for free rations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-test-rbi-enabled-digital-food-coupons-for-free-rations/articleshow/127783489.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government is set to roll out a pilot for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or ‘digital food currency’ under the free ration scheme to a limited number of beneficiaries in Chandigarh, Puducherry and three districts of Gujarat next month. Under this, beneficiaries will receive monthly digital food coupons directly into an RBI-enabled digital wallet on their mobile phones and they will get the entitled free foodgrains from ration shops by simply scanning the shop owners’ QR code to redeem the coupons.This initiative is aimed at bringing greater transparency and plugging any leakage in the world’s largest free food security programme and relieving ration card holders from the hassle of biometric authentication. People aware about the plan said this will be conducted as a Proof of Concept (POC) for the “digital food currency” across three regions and will be at a small-scale to demonstrate the feasibility, functionality, and practical potential of the initiative.Government will also set a timeframe for using the digital coupon to avoid accumulation. Earlier this month, a soft launch was done in Ahmedabad with 25 beneficiaries.A state government official said since then around 2,000 transactions have been completed successfully. The pilot to be rolled out next month will cover Anand, Sabarmati and Dahod.In the case of Chandigarh and Puducherry, Centre had rolled out Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for foodgrains in 2015, which replaced physical foodgrain distribution with direct cash transfers to beneficiaries’ bank accounts. Officials said the digital food currency will ensure that beneficiaries are using the subsidy only for buying foodgrains and for no other purpose.Since there has been no provision of distribution of foodgrains in these two UTs, there are no ration shops. Officials said the authorities are exploring how certain outlets can be identified for distribution of free foodgrain by accepting the digital currency. They added that the free foodgrains which will be distributed through these outlets or ration shops will be supplied by the Food Corporation India (FCI) or state government agencies.Officials said options are also being explored to see that beneficiaries who still use basic or feature phones and hence can’t use the ewallet, can use the digital food food currency.","Government is set to roll out a pilot for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or ‘digital food currency’ under the free ration scheme to a limited number of beneficiaries.

This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, “Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn’t happen. A decision is likely soon on stopping the practice of manually feeding vehicle registration numbers in the system to deduct toll. In such cases, there is a possibility of the toll attendants noting down wrong details. This becomes an unnecessary hassle for commuters.""The ministry claimed that with the implementation of FASTag the average time taken to cross toll plaza has reduced to 40 seconds compared to earlier 12.2 minutes per vehicle under the manual tolling system.In a separate written reply to a question on the total toll collection, the road transport ministry said that in the past three quarters of financial year 2025-26, Rs 50,195 crore was collected as user fee across the NH and expressway network.

NEW DELHI: In an urgent missive to Election Commission, Congress on Thursday accused the ruling BJP of using the EC’s Form 7 to target genuine voters for wrongful deletion in the Claim and Objection phase of the SIR in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Kerala.AICC general secretary and MP KC Venugopal, in a complaint to EC, termed the watchdog’s inaction in addressing concerns about systematic subversion of electoral rolls revision as worrisome and urged immediate steps to prevent BJP from misusing the electoral rolls to gain unfair electoral advantage.“These actions, if not taken cognizance of by the Commission, ... will lead to the disenfranchisement of lakhs of voters, especially those belonging to the backward, marginalised communities,” he said, adding that backward communities are being targeted by BJP.Venugopal said Form 7 serves a narrow purpose of raising objection to a voter’s name with fact-based reasons like death or duplication, and “is not meant for generalised or speculative objections”. He said the burden of proof too rests on the person filing the Form, with penalties prescribed for making a false submission.Specifying the pattern involved in engineering wrongful deletion, Venugopal said Form 7 is being generated in bulk through a centralised system, which is then being used to raise objections in bulk against targetted categories of electors, including SCs, STs, the minorities and senior citizens.He said these forms are then being handed over to BLOs across multiple constituencies through a well-organised mechanism. The striking feature here is the absence of clear and verifiable particulars of the individual submitting the Form 7, though EC mandates disclosure of an objector’s identity along with documentary material substantiating the objection. He said in many instances, the alleged objectors denied filing the objections.“This casts serious doubts over the sanctity of the entire SIR process being undertaken,” he said.Congress urged EC to institute real-time supervision over the voter deletion process and the monitoring of Form 7 applications, including their issuance and submission. It also sought investigation under Article 324 into misuse of Form 7. Congress further urged EC to release disaggregated data relating to Form-7 applications for all 12 States undergoing SIR.","Congress accuses the ruling BJP of using the EC’s Form 7 to target genuine voters for wrongful deletion.

NEW DELHI: MGNREGA will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the Modi govt during the budget session of Parliament, with its demand for the rural job scheme’s restoration likely to trigger stormy exchanges in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Opposition INDIA bloc, which held a coordination meeting in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday ahead of the start of the session, also decided to fully participate in the session which includes the Union budget and the Motion of Thanks to the President’s joint address. The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is another issue on the opposition’s agenda.In the strategy discussions, attended by Rahul Gandhi, DMK’s TR Baalu, RSP’s NK Premachandran, Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Arvind Sawant, SP’s Javed Ali Khan, CPM’s John Brittas, CPI’s P Sandosh, Congress’s KC Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh, Manickam Tagore, RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, among others, the leaders decided to mark their protest over the job scheme as President Droupadi Murmu in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament on Wednesday mentioned VB-GRAMG that will replace MGNREGA. TMC did not attend the discussions.When the President’s speech mentioned the VB-GRAMG scheme, opposition MPs stood up and raised slogans. While the action riled the govt into slamming the opposition, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said, “Today during the President’s address, all opposition parties most respectfully and in a dignified manner protested the bulldozed repeal of MGNREGA. The opposition will use all democratic means to demand the restoration of MGNREGA.If the statement made clear the opposition’s intent to make the job scheme the front and centre of its parliamentary agenda, the same scenes may be witnessed during the presentation of the Union budget.The reason behind the focus on MGNREGA seems to be the upcoming five assembly elections and the unanimity among the parties on the issue. The belief among the opposition parties is that the disbanding of the job scheme poses a serious threat to the availability of distress employment for the poor in the future because of the shifting of a considerable financial burden on the states under VB-GRAMG.Since the subject would automatically become part of the discussion on the Union budget and then also figure in debate on the motion of thanks, it would provide ample opportunity to the rivals to amplify concerns and target BJP.However, there is some uncertainty in the INDIA bloc over its decision to focus on MGNREGA and to participate in the session, in view of what TMC may do after it comes to Parliament in the coming days, after the initial absence.

During a meeting this month, the Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi had reportedly conveyed to the TN leaders that alliance with DMK was in place and urged them to stop public comments on the issue.According to sources, the talks between Kanimozhi and Rahul were pleasant in which the DMK expressed its respect for Congress. However, Rahul is learnt to have said that the DMK should start talks on seat-sharing with the committee formed by Congress president Kharge.The AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Girish Chodankar on Tuesday said he was waiting for the last two months for the DMK to initiate discussions with the Congress panel, an exasperation shared by the party in general.It is learnt that Congress has presented the DMK with a list of 41 seats, but the lead TN partner is reluctant to concede the demand.Congress had sought 41 seats in 2021 polls but was given to contest only 25.While the stress was on initiating the seat-sharing talks, sources said no numbers were discussed between the Gandhi scion and the DMK emissary.Though staunch allies since 2004, the Congress and DMK ties have witnessed rumblings in recent months, with a section of state Congress seeking more seats and a share in future govt. Some have even touted the newbie TVK of movie star Vijay as an option.But DMK is averse to sharing power, having run a single-party govt in the state despite leading a rainbow alliance of multiple outfits.However, the AICC panel is still likely to broach the demand for power-sharing when it discusses seats with the DMK.The TN polls are set to be an exciting contest, with AIADMK, reportedly under pressure from BJP, agreeing to include its breakaway factions in a grand alliance that includes the BJP. The other political pole is TVK that has created a buzz with the star power of Vijay drawing large crowds. While the DMK has been confident of its prospects after its sweep of 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the emergence of TVK has raised concerns in some quarters.","DMK parliamentary party head K Kanimozhi met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at his residence for a discussion Wednesday.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Dhaka: Days after India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh, Dhaka on Wednesday shrugged off New Delhi’s concerns, saying it is their “choice” and “not our concern”. “If they want to take their families back, it is not our concern. There is no security concern. I do not understand what signal is being sent. It is their decision,” Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said.The advisory was issued last week following massive anti-India protests near the Indian high commission in Dhaka and assistant high commissions in other cities — angry protests had come precariously close to the diplomatic facility in Chittagong — as well as a series of attacks on minority Hindus, including killings, since the death of radical Islamist leader and India-baiter Sharif Osman Hadi on Dec 18, six days after he was shot.“There is no situation in the country that would compel diplomats to send their family members back home or where officials or their family members are in danger,” Touhid said, adding he sees “no justification for the reported non-family posting of Indian diplomats”. He told reporters that the Bangladesh govt has not been informed of any security concerns regarding the family members of Indian diplomats.While the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and its missions have suspended visa operations, the Indian high commission in Dhaka and its missions continue to remain open.","India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh.

Delhi High Court Demands DGCA Response on Pilot Duty Regulations Amid Safety Concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-high-court-demands-dgca-response-on-pilot-duty-regulations-amid-safety-concerns/articleshow/127745995.cms,".

New Delhi: Concerns about public safety due to non-implementation of DGCA regulations to prevent pilot fatigue could not be “brushed aside”, Delhi high court said Wednesday, and sought the aviation regulator’s stand on a plea challenging its decision to keep in abeyance the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms.FDTL regulations prescribe minimum rest periods for pilots and flight crew members and aim to strengthen fatigue management to ensure passenger safety.Hearing a PIL against DGCA’s move to pause implementation of the revised FDTL norms till Feb 10 in the wake of a massive disruption in IndiGo operations, a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia orally remarked: “It has a direct link to the safety of passengers. Unless the regulations are challenged, or there is some flaw, they need to enforce it. The regulations were in force for a long time, but they were not being followed. We are not considering the rationale of the regulations. When regulations are in force, they are to be implemented until revised.”The bench listed the matter for hearing on Thursday and asked the DGCA counsel to seek instructions.The PIL submitted that IndiGo had cancelled hundreds of flights across the country in the first week of Dec 2025, as the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight-duty norms for pilots.On Dec 5, DGCA eased the regulations — by allowing the substitution of leave with a weekly rest period — to enable IndiGo to have more pilots on duty to normalise operations.The petitioner alleged that the relaxation was illegally given by DGCA only to IndiGo, and was prima facie mala fide. The court, however, said the relaxation was applicable to all airlines.When the counsel for IndiGo questioned the locus of the petitioner, Sabari Roy, the HC dismissed it saying she was a former aircraft engineer and the issue had a bearing on public safety.“She worked as an aircraft engineer. Her functions are directly connected with passenger safety... The concern cannot be brushed aside,” the court said, noting that once in force, the regulations must be implemented unless decided otherwise by authorities.The bench, however, acknowledged that such petitions created pressure on regulators and they sometimes succumbed to it.",The Delhi high court has sought the aviation regulator's stand on a plea challenging its decision to keep in abeyance the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms.FDTL regulations prescribe minimum rest periods for pilots and flight crew members and aim to strengthen fatigue management.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127745983,imgsize-7708,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-05-14-220545.jpg"

New Delhi: Supreme Court suo motu decided Wednesday to examine whether a person born to upper-caste affluent parents can convert to claim minority status and, thus, become eligible for admission to a minority educational institution.A brother-sister doctor duo from an affluent village got through NEET-PG and wanted to pursue their post-graduate medical courses in a particular medical institute in UP, whose claim to be a minority institution belonging to Buddhist community has been challenged. Their counsel argued before a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the UP govt was not granting minority status to the institution and hampering their admissions to the institute.Being from Haryana, CJI Kant found that the brother-sister duo belonged to the affluent Satrod Kalan village in Hisar district. He scrutinised their NEET-PG application forms and discovered that both had applied under ‘general category’, but got minority certificates from sub-divisional officer at Hisar last year after allegedly converting to Buddhism.Raising doubts over the minority certificates, the justices asked the chief secretary of Haryana to inquire into the process adopted by the SDO and dismissed the siblings’ plea.",Supreme Court suo motu decided Wednesday to examine whether a person born to upper-caste affluent parents can convert to claim minority status.

India-EU FTA Explained: What Gets Cheaper, Who Gains And Why This Deal Matters To Indian Consumers

Hyderabad: PM Modi Wednesday urged global aviation companies and investors to partner with India in aircraft manufacturing, pilot training, advanced air mobility and aircraft leasing, as the country consolidates its position as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market and pushes into a new phase of aviation-led growth, reports Swati Bharadwaj.In a recorded video message at the inaugural session of Wings India 2026, Modi said few countries offer India’s combination of scale, political stability and technological ambition. “I invite investors from around the world to join us as co-pilots on India’s flight to success,” the PM added.Modi stressed the need for self-reliance in aviation and pointed to efforts to build domestic capability in aircraft design and manufacturing. He said India is moving from being a parts supplier to making military and transport aircraft.","PM Modi urges global aviation companies and investors to partner with India in aircraft manufacturing, pilot training, advanced air mobility and aircraft leasing.

Parliament Erupts As President Mentions VB-G RAM G Act, Opposition Slams Move To Replace MGNREGA

New Delhi: With acrimony between govt and opposition benches often leading to disruption in Parliament, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said issues like national security and resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’ should be beyond any differences and asked MPs from across the political divide to speak in one voice on matters of national interest.In her address to a joint sitting of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to mark the Budget session’s start, she invoked a number of leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, identified with contesting ideologies to assert that they stood for burying differences for the country’s interest.The resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’, India’s security, self-reliance and swadeshi were the issues over which Parliament should be unanimous as it was accepted that nothing was bigger than the nation despite difference of opinions, she said, while also invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, Sardar Patel and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.Her lauding of the VB-G RAM G law, which replaces MGNREGA, saying it would eliminate corruption and boost rural development, drew protests from opposition members, who called for its rollback while BJP and its allies thumped their desks in praise of the new scheme.The opposition was also heard protesting when Murmu began her speech, prompting parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju to later accuse them of insulting revered figures she mentioned.Congress charged him with spreading lies, saying it was only demanding MGNREGA restoration. The prospect of another showdown looms large as the opposition has sought to revive debate over SIR and VB-G RAM G, with Rijiju ruling out the possibility.In her address, which is prepared by govt, Murmu lauded the governing dispensation for its firm response to Pakistan-linked terrorism with Operation Sindoor, decisive action against Maoist terror, working for the uplift of backward communities, and for ensuring that Indian economy remains the fastest growing major economy despite global challenges.“India has proved that power can be used with responsibility and wisdom. My govt sent a strong message that any terrorist attack on India will receive a firm and decisive response,” she said. Maoist terror, she noted, once affected 126 districts but had receded to eight.PM Narendra Modi described her address as inspiring, comprehensive and insightful, saying it reflected India’s remarkable development journey in recent times. “The emphasis on building a Viksit Bharat was perfectly captured, reflecting our shared aspiration of building a strong and self-reliant nation. The address also covered a wide range of themes, highlighting sustained efforts for farmers, youth, the poor and the downtrodden. It reaffirmed our collective commitment to further speed up the ‘reform express’ and the emphasis on innovation and good governance,” he said.Murmu also referred to the free trade agreement India has signed with EU, saying it would boost manufacturing and service sectors and create new employment opportunities for the youth.","President Droupadi Murmu said issues like national security and resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’ should be beyond any differences.

New Delhi: Noting that most states have not complied with its order to take steps to remove stray dogs from premises of public institutions and implement the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules for vaccination and sterilisation, Supreme Court on Wednesday said these states “will get a proper dressing down”.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria, while going through the affidavit filed by the states, said the information provided was vague, merely an eyewash, and contained fudged figures. The court was shocked after going through Jharkhand’s affidavit which claimed that nearly 1.9 lakh dogs were sterilised in the last two months. SC pointed out that manpower and infrastructure deployed by the state could not result in sterilisation of such a large number of dogs within such a short period of time.After SC passed the order on Nov 7 last year, the Jharkhand govt took action to implement the ABC Rules, and it claimed to have sterilised “1.89 lakh dogs” in contrast to Delhi that takes a year to sterilise around one lakh dogs.“It is all fudged up figures... All states make vague statements. It is an eyewash. They will get a proper dressing down,” the bench said.Senior advocate Gaurav Agarwal, who is assisting the bench as amicus curiae, brought to the court’s notice the deficiencies in the states’ responses after examining each of the affidavits filed by them.The court was also informed that there were 1.66 lakh dog bites reported in Assam in 2024 but the state has only one dog centre. “It is astonishing. In 2024 there were 1.66 lakh bites. And, in 2025 only in Jan, there were 20,900. This is shocking,” the top court said.The responses filed by the states were also silent on many issues, including the number of stray dogs, dog pounds, ABC centres and human resources employed by them to remove strays from institutions.SC in Nov directed that stray dogs be removed from the premises of educational institutions, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands/depots and railway stations.","SC in Nov directed that stray dogs be removed from the premises of educational institutions, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands/depots and railway stations.

New Delhi: Garima Dhruwa, a class 11 student at the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) for tribal students in Kosambuda in Chhattisgarh, in her first ever trip outside of her state to Delhi, stole the limelight at a packed auditorium at Bharat Mandapam on Wednesday as she played a confident ‘sarpanch’ showcasing what a model gram sabha should offer to make grassroots democracy truly participatory.Steering the narrative as a ‘Sarpanch’, Garima as part of a team of around 30 students, brought alive a “Model Youth Gram Sabha” (MYGS) as it would unravel in a village - listening, deliberating and offering solutions.“There was no script here. We, along with our teachers shortlisted the issues affecting the villages and presented what we have experienced through everyday life in our own villages,” the humanities student who aspires to be an IAS officer told TOI on the sidelines of a programme organised by the ministry of panchayati raj where the mock gram sabha presentation received applause and much appreciation.Daughter of a teacher, Garima now feels confident of reaching out to the panchayat pradhan in her own village to take up issues that bothered her as a child. One such issue being difficulty in accessing water due to broken taps in public spaces meant for villagers.From classes 9 and 11 and having their own lived experiences of challenges in their villages, each of the girls and boys in Garima’s team played a role ranging from ‘panch’ to to the panchayat secretary and the village residents of all age groups.Far away from home, Garima and her schoolmates presented before policy makers, representatives from Panchayati Raj Institutions, teachers and youth among others in the audience the aspirations of the villages surrounding Kosambuda in Chhatisgarh and how this was the story of most villages across states.The issues ranged from a girl playing the Self Help Group member appealing to the Sabha to support her by buying the products made by women to residents calling for stepping up sanitation in the area by creating waste water channels and planting more trees around the outlets to put the run-off water to good use.The Panchayat also approved the demand for a dedicated vehicle to ferry pregnant women to the hospital that is far from the village and a fine of Rs 500 to punish those found to be using abusive language in public places. The Sarpanch and other members also reprimanded families for not sending their children to school.From the North of India another group of students - they came from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Himachal Pradesh's Una drew from everyday experiences of village life to highlight how the civic, infrastructure, livelihood, social and cultural issues in villages were best solved through mutual discussion as the sense of community continues to be strong factor.A class 11 science student, Shivam Sharma who played the Sarpanch told TOI that the learnings in the process of putting together the Gram Sabha have given him a new perspective about the village he comes from and the ones that surround his school.“We drew a list of issues affecting the villages with their teachers, went out to visit the village, surveyed the space and met with the gram pradhan and then planned our own gram sabha,” shared Sharma who aspires to be a doctor. Here the roadmap that developed through the discussions included demands ranging from creating a library for children to putting solar lights. Better education, health and more avenues for livelihood were concerns raised through the course of the discussion. Interestingly, the Sarpanch and other members also discussed the transition from Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to the new law Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin).Both these schools - the one from Chhattisgarh among EMRS and the other from Una among JNVs that held ‘Model Youth Gram Sabha’ in their schools across states were conferred with the first prize at the national awards programme as a recognition of their work at Bharat Mandapam. Both schools were given an award money of Rs 1 crore each for development activities.Addressing the gathering, union minister of state SP Singh Baghel said that these model youth gram sabhas ""mark a paradigm shift in civic education by offering students hands-on exposure to grassroots democracy as they get to engage with Panchayati Raj Institutions, strengthen the spirit of gram swaraj and nurture leadership qualities"".Secretary, ministry of panchayati raj, Vivek Bharadwaj added that the “initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of nurturing 1 lakh young leaders across the country” and “demonstrates how youth can contribute meaningfully to solving ground level problems”.A comprehensive compendium documenting the transformative journey of MYGS released at the programme highlighted how over 28,000 students from 619 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas and 200 Eklavya Model Residential Schools successfully participated in simulated gram sabha and gram panchayat proceedings nationwide over the past few months.Going forward the govt plans to institutionalise the ""model youth gram sabhas"" into its scheme - the ‘Rashtriya Gram Sabha Abhiyan’ wherein the states will be asked to weave in this outreach exercise among youth in their plans for the financial year 2026-27.“With over 6.64 lakh villages housing nearly 65-70% of the population, the vitality of rural India lies in the strength of its gram sabhas. As a constitutional body under Article 243, the gram sabha embodies direct democracy, enabling every adult resident of the village to participate in governance, deliberate on development priorities, and ensure accountability of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs),” the ministry said in a statement.It further stated that despite its critical role in rural governance, youth participation in gram sabhas remains low, largely due to limited awareness, insufficient exposure, and a lack of meaningful engagement opportunities.It was in this backdrop to encourage and cultivate civic consciousness among students, the ministry of panchayati raj, in partnership with the department of school education and literacy and the ministry of tribal affairs, conceptualised the “Model Youth Gram Sabha”.","Garima Dhruwa, a class 11 student at the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) for tribal students in Kosambuda in Chhattisgarh, in her first ever trip outside of her state to Delhi.

Scrutiny of disability for govt staff should be based on 'specific suspicion': NHRC chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scrutiny-of-disability-for-govt-staff-should-be-based-on-specific-suspicion-nhrc-chief/articleshow/127732473.cms,".

New Delhi: Following deliberations on human rights violations arising out of re-verification and re-assessment of certificates of govt employees with disabilities, National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) chairperson Justice V Ramasubramanian has suggested that such scrutiny be carried out only in cases where there is specific suspicion, instead of mass re-verification of all employees with disability.The concern emerged at a meeting of NHRC’s core group on disabilities that was chaired by Justice Ramasubramanian. The chairperson noted that, understandably, Centre’s revised advisory and SOP dated Oct 15, 2025, for handling disability verification in govt jobs and education is meant to be applied prospectively only for new applicants and not retrospectively to reassess all existing beneficiaries.He observed that applying the SOP retrospectively for all of them may have legal implications. Thus, instead of mass verification, the scrutiny should be limited to cases where there is specific suspicion.“The Commission will further deliberate upon the suggestions and inputs from different stakeholders to finalise its recommendations to the government for ensuring the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities,” an NHRC statement said.The meeting saw the suggestion being made that blanket or mass medical reassessment of all govt employees with disabilities should be prohibited.Other suggestions included adoption of UDID-based digital verification as the default mechanism, with medical reassessment only being an exception, based on clearly defined and evidence-based suspicion, and elimination of the need to re-issue certificates to employees living with irreversible disabilities.On the issue of reassessment, Rajeev Sharma, joint secretary, department of empowerment of persons with disabilities, ministry of social justice and empowerment, clarified that the primary intent of the department was to ensure due diligence at the stage of admission to higher educational institutions and recruitment for govt jobs.Dr S Govindaraj, commissioner of persons with disabilities, said that verification mechanisms must remain targeted and proportional to ensure that persons with genuine disabilities are not unnecessarily inconvenienced. He said that existing guidelines emphasise validation rather than mass reassessment.Meanwhile, secretary general, NHRC, Bharat Lal said that persons with disabilities (PwD) must be treated with respect and dignity, while ensuring safeguards are in place against misuse of legal provisions. He highlighted that re-assessment of disability can be intrusive and make people feel a loss of dignity. Although the 2016 Act increased reservation for PwD from 3% to 4%, misuse and weak social values result in persons with genuine disabilities facing hardships, he added.",The concern emerged at a meeting of NHRC’s core group on disabilities.

'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the “historic” free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union in Delhi a day before is a “global gamechanger” and will open countless opportunities for lakhs of Indian youths.Addressing a gathering at the annual National Cadet Corps PM Rally at Delhi Cantt here, the PM said the entire world is looking at India's youth with a “lot of trust” and the reason behind that trust is “skill and ‘sanskar’ (culture)”. He underlined that this agreement with 27 countries will benefit Indian startups by easing access to funding and innovation ecosystems, while also boosting India’s creative economy in film, gaming, fashion, digital content, music, and design. He stated that the deal will create new opportunities for Indian youth in research, education, IT, and professional services.Modi underscored it will accelerate the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign and strengthen the resolve of “Make in India, Make for the World”. He explained that under this agreement, tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports will either be zero or very low, benefiting industries such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, footwear, engineering goods, and MSMEs.He said the deal will also bring more investment into India, leading to new engineering, electronics, chemical, pharma, and other manufacturing plants, while creating assured markets for agriculture, food processing, and fisheries, which will be a major opportunity for farmers, fishermen, and rural youth. He said this FTA directly connects India’s youth to Europe’s job market, creating opportunities especially in engineering, green technology, design, logistics, and advanced manufacturing, meaning new avenues are opening for Indian youth across 27 countries.“Before this (EU FTA), India has done FTAs with Oman, New Zealand, Britain, the UAE, Australia, and countries like Mauritius...I had addressed from the Red Fort that ‘Yahi samay hai, sahi samay hai' (this is the time, this is the right time). For the country's youth, it is a time for maximum opportunities,"" Modi said, adding, “this is not just a trade agreement. This is a new blueprint for shared prosperity”.Modi also “noted with grief that the day also brought great sorrow due to the tragic plane crash in Maharashtra this morning, which claimed the lives of Deputy CM,Shri Ajit Pawar ji and some colleagues.” He highlighted that “Ajit Dada made a significant contribution to the development of Maharashtra and the nation, especially by working to improve village life, and expressed condolences to Shri Ajit Pawar ji’s family. ” He stated that in this moment of pain, the nation stands with the families of those lost in the accident.Lauding the impressive tableau on Op Sindoor, Modi appreciated the efforts of NCC cadets during that critical moment for national security. He noted their contributions in supporting the armed forces, organising blood donation camps, and providing first-aid services.Emphasising that Op Sindoor reaffirmed India’s strength and the valour of its armed forces, Modi said it also demonstrated the advancement of indigenous weapons. He stressed that in modern warfare, the role of youth skills has increased significantly, as battles are now fought not only with tanks and guns but also in code and cloud. He warned that nations lagging in technology are weak not only in economy but also in security, and stressed that innovation by youth strengthens patriotism and contributes to national security.Modi called for a new tradition in the country, proposing that NCC, NSS, and My Young India organisation hold a grand event every Jan 25 to honour first-time voters, expressing confidence that this effort will strengthen the sense of responsibility among youth and reinforce democracy.",'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth.

NW DELHI: A patient advocacy group has cautioned the government over the free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, urging it to make the full text public and place it before the Parliament for a detailed discussion, prior to its signing.The group said such scrutiny is essential to enable an informed debate on the FTA’s implications for the pharmaceutical sector. Even though the pact does not explicitly talk about patent-related provisions, it provides a high level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights, including copyright, trademarks, designs, trade secrets and plant variety rights.The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.``The govt should clarify and ensure that the final text does not include any TRIPS-plus provisions, particularly patent term extensions and data exclusivity, which would compromise the availability of affordable medicines’’, KM Gopakumar, co-convenor, Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment told TOI.India plays an important role as a supplier of affordable generic medicines to low- and middle-income countries.Any weakening of its patent laws or regulatory framework through FTAs risks having an impact not only on patients in India, but millions worldwide who depend on Indian generic production, the group said.The agreement clearly demonstrates that India has agreed to IP protection and enforcement standards that go beyond the minimum obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). However, notably the press release (by EU) does not mention patent related provisions, nor does it clarify whether the agreement includes controversial TRIPS-plus measures such as patent term extensions, pharmaceutical data exclusivity, or other forms of market exclusivity for medicines, he added.Earlier, when negotiations were relaunched in 2022, the European Union’s proposed IP text explicitly sought patent term extension and data exclusivity protection for pharmaceutical products. In the previous rounds of negotiations, particularly during 2007-2013, India had rejected these TRIPS-plus demands following strong opposition from civil society, patent groups, and public health advocates.``We caution against repeating the approach adopted in the FTAs with EFTA and the UK that risk having a direct or indirect impact on access to affordable medicines’’, a statement from the patient advocacy group said.Further, it is also important to note that the EU–Mercosur agreement, reflects a shift away from the inclusion of patent related TRIPS-plus provisions in FTAs. This precedent should be followed in the EU-India agreement too, it added.","The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.

No more gold-plated silver medals for retiring railway officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-more-gold-plated-silver-medals-for-retiring-railway-officials/articleshow/127721094.cms,"NEW DELHI: The railway ministry on Wednesday discontinued the practice of presenting gold-plated silver medals to retiring officials, days after allegations surfaced regarding their quality and laboratory tests found that they were made largely of copper.In a circular issued to heads of all zones and production units, the ministry said, “...it has now been decided with the approval of the President that the practice of presenting gold-plated silver medals to retiring railway officers may be discontinued. The silver medals, which are already procured/available in stock with railways, may be accounted for and suitably used for other activities, redressing their utilisation concerns. ”Though the circular did not mention any reason for the decision, officials said that there have been various concerns, including the poor quality of medals supplied by outsourced vendors and need for cost-cutting as silver has become expensive.The practice had been continuing since March 2006 when the ministry decided to present all railway employees who seek voluntary retirement or superannuate with a gold-plated silver medal weighing around 20 grams.An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision addresses two issues: one of quality and second of the end of a culture which doesn’t exist in any other ministry or department. Sharing a contrasting view, another official said the national transporter could have fixed the problem and ensured that the quality of medals was not compromised.“Rather than giving the task of procurement of these medals to zones and production units, railways could have tied up with agencies like MMTC for getting them,” said the official.","The practice had been continuing since March 2006 when the ministry decided to present all railway employees who seek voluntary retirement or superannuate with a gold-plated silver medal weighing around 20 grams.

Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason’ for such a move.

BHUBANESWAR: Traffic may be affected on Wednesday as a farmers’ organisation, Navnirman Krushak Sangathan (NKS), has called for a statewide bandh in protest against alleged problems in paddy procurement.NKS convenor Akshay Kumar said that the bandh will not affect railways and any emergency services. However, farmers will demonstrate on roads as part of the bandh from 6 am to 2 pm while the NKS has appealed business and commercial establishments to down shutters.Akshay said apart from govt’s failure to lift paddy on time, the protest will highlight loot of people, especially farmers, in the name of installing smart meters for electricity. Besides, illogical fines on people in the name of not doing pollution under check certificates.Responding to the bandh call, BJP spokesperson Manoj Mohapatra said the protest is planned by non-farmers. “Farmers in Odisha are very happy with the Mohan Charan Majhi govt because of its pro-farmer initiatives such as Rs 800 per quintal bonus for paddy,” he said.Amiya Kumar Pattnaik, national coordinator of All India Kisan Congress, farmers’ wing of Congress, said the party will fully support the bandh call as farmers are in distress. BJD spokesperson Lenin Mohanty said, “BJD has thanked the NKS for raising farmers’ issue even as the party will go ahead with its own agitation plan district-wise from Feb 2 and a massive demonstration in Bhubaneswar on Feb 24.”","Farmers' organisation, Navnirman Krushak Sangathan (NKS), has called for a statewide bandh in protest against alleged problems in paddy procurement.

India–EU FTA: Top winners and losers of the 'mother of all trade deals',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indiaeu-fta-top-winners-and-losers-of-the-mother-of-all-trade-deals/articleshow/127641711.cms,"'Biggest In India's History': PM Modi Hails India-EU FTA, Says It Will Reshape Global Economy

What the deal covers

Under the FTA, duties will be cut on 99.5% of goods exported from India to the EU, including seafood and footwear.

In return, India will reduce or eliminate tariffs on 96.6% of goods imported from the EU, including phased cuts for European carmakers and alcohol producers.

Once implemented, the pact will create a combined market of nearly 2 billion people, spanning the world’s fourth-largest economy (India) and the second-largest economic bloc (EU).

Indian apparel manufacturers and gems and jewellery exporters are among the biggest gainers, as EU duties on these products will be cut to zero.

Domestic food producers will also get preferential access to the European market.

However, Indian automakers and liquor companies are expected to face stiffer competition as lower import levies make European products cheaper.

As companies await more details, here’s a look at who stands to gain and and who may lose:

Big winners

Apparel & textiles

Leather & footwear

Gems & jewellery

Food products & seafood

Benefits for India

Preferential access across 97% of tariff lines, covering 99.5% of trade value.

Immediate duty elimination for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery.

Zero-duty entry for $33 billion worth of exports currently facing EU tariffs of 4–26%.

Sensitive sectors like dairy, cereals and poultry are protected.

Losers

Trade without Trump

Liquor makers

Indian carmakers

Why the deal matters

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union on Tuesday announced the conclusion of negotiations for a landmark free trade agreement (FTA), ending talks that began nearly two decades ago.The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement and is expected to significantly boost exports to the 27-nation EU bloc while reshaping competition for several domestic industries.The agreement comes at a time when global trade flows have been disrupted by high US tariffs, fragile supply chains and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.India is currently facing steep tariffs from the US, while the EU is also under threat of higher American duties.India gains immediate zero-duty access to a $263 billion European textile market. The government said tariffs on textile imports will be eliminated immediately.CareEdge Ratings called the deal ""critical"" for improving competitiveness, estimating India could raise its EU market share to 9% from 5%, adding nearly $4.5 billion in annual exports over the medium term.Textile stocks reacted sharply, with KPR Mill, Welspun Living, and Kitex Garments posting strong gains, Bloomberg reported.Tariffs on leather and footwear have been slashed to zero from 17%, opening up a $100 billion EU market for Indian exporters.The EU has granted duty-free access to Indian gems and jewellery. Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said bilateral trade could double to Rs 910 billion in the next three years.""This timely pact will help Indian exporters salvage lost ground,"" he said, noting that exports to the US have fallen sharply.Indian exporters of shrimp, frozen fish and value-added seafood products will get preferential access to the EU market. Producers of tea, coffee, spices, grapes and processed food will also benefit, while safeguards remain in place for sensitive sectors like dairy and poultry.The ""mother of all deals"" comes at a critical moment for the global economy, which has been unsettled by the unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump.The landmark India–EU trade pact is expected to reduce both sides’ dependence on the United States and China.Negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gained momentum after tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.The Trump administration has openly criticised the agreement.Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alleged that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine war by purchasing energy products routed through India.He argued that European countries were weakening their own security by importing refined fuel from India that originates from Russian crude oil, while Washington imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.""We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,"" Bessent said.However, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has dismissed suggestions that US tariffs played a role in pushing the deal forward, saying, ""I don’t think we even discussed this.""India has sharply cut tariffs on European alcohol. Duties on wine have been reduced to 20%, spirits to 40% (from as high as 150%), and beer to 50%.This is expected to intensify competition for Indian liquor firms. ""It’s a negative for Indian liquormakers,"" said Karan Taurani of Elara Securities. Shares of Sula Vineyards, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan fell after the announcement.The pact allows up to 250,000 European vehicles to enter India at preferential rates, with tariffs gradually dropping from 110% to as low as 10%. Duties on auto components will also be scrapped over 5–10 years.Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles slipped following the news.Signed after nearly two decades of negotiations, the agreement marks India’s most ambitious trade pact so far and is set to reshape supply chains, pricing power and growth prospects across sectors.""Textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, pharma, and high-tech engineering"" will benefit from the deal, Munjal Almoula, managing partner for Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India told Bloomberg.India’s goods trade with the EU stood at $136.5 billion in 2024-25, making the bloc its largest trading partner.The FTA is expected to be signed later this year, following legal vetting and approval by the European Parliament.","The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Limited Room for Tax Relief

Capital Gains and Market Participation

The Next Phase of

Tax Simplification

Administrative Reforms

Take away

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Asian stocks today: Markets open at low amid AI investment fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-open-at-low-amid-ai-investment-fears/articleshow/127790432.cms,"Representative AI image

Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow. Tech stocks took a hit, while gold and silver prices dropped from their record highs. Oil prices also fell as tensions between the US and Iran showed signs of easing. The market's ups and downs this week were influenced by various factors, including a weaker dollar and Donald Trump's threats against Iran.The tech sector's earlier optimism about AI, boosted by strong earnings from Meta, Samsung, and SK hynix, took a downturn after Microsoft's announcement. The company revealed plans to increase AI infrastructure spending, which worried investors about delayed returns on investment. This news had a significant impact on Microsoft's stock.""Microsoft suffered its worst session since the Covid‑era crash, falling 12 percent and accounting for over two‑thirds of the S&P 500's decline,"" said National Australia Bank's Rodrigo Catril, as quoted by AFP. He pointed out that investors were worried about rising costs and slower growth in cloud services.Most Asian markets struggled, with Hong Kong and Shanghai dropping more than 1%.Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila also fell, while Seoul and Wellington saw some gains. Jakarta continued to face challenges after MSCI raised concerns about ownership issues.Indian markets also opened at a low. While Nifty50 went below 25,300, BSE Sensex was down over 500 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,274.65, down 144 points or 0.57%. BSE Sensex was at 82,056.49, down 510 points or 0.62%.Gold prices retreated to around $5,200 per ounce after hitting $5,595, while silver dropped to $110 from its peak of over $121. The slight increase in the dollar value contributed to this decline, despite Trump's apparent comfort with a weaker US currency.Oil markets remained volatile, with prices falling more than 1% after Thursday's 5% surge. This came as Trump warned Iran about possible strikes while sending military forces to the region. However, fears persist about potential conflicts in the oil-rich area, which could drive up prices and inflation.The overall market sentiment reflects caution about tech valuations and concerns about possible market bubbles, as stocks have reached record highs in recent years largely due to tech sector growth.","Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow.
