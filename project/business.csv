Back to build

In the Indian startup ecosystem, one constantly hears about how IITs and BITS produce some incredible founders. But there is a large cohort of founders that doesn’t get as much airtime despite quietly outperforming any single IIT when it comes to unicorn creation. Meet the BARBIE founders — those who did their Bachelors Abroad and Returned to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. The term, coined by Sajith Pai, a Partner at Blume Ventures, has gained traction as a shorthand for this distinct founder archetype.From Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal to Zepto’s Aadit Palicha, these founders have moved back to India to build audacious, ambitious and enduring businesses in the country. The numbers speak for themselves — of the roughly 300 BARBIE founders we identified, 3.7% have gone on to build unicorns, a rate higher than IIT Delhi (2.7%) and IIT Bombay (2%). BARBIE founders have started 11.5% of all active unicorns in the country.In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK according to Open Doors and HESA, compared to 20,000 students a decade ago.While this is a tiny minority of the overall Indian undergrad population of 33m students, this number has been growing fast due to rising income levels in India and a myriad of problems with the Indian college experience. Importantly, many of these students are now returning to build in India. Though there is no reliable data on this reverse brain drain, anecdotal evidence suggests that return rates among Indian undergrads are on par with, or slightly higher than, earlier cohorts, likely influenced by recent geopolitical concerns.BARBIEs overwhelmingly build companies targeted at consumers rather than enterprises. Consumer brands account for 37% of all BARBIE-founded companies, followed by marketplaces, fintech, gaming, and other consumer internet businesses.There are two key reasons for this. First is taste and global exposure. These founders usually go to colleges in the US (78%) and UK (16%) that happen to be a melting pot of cultures. New consumer trends naturally emerge from these cultural hotspots and founders are then able to bring this novel flavour of products with a local twist back to India.The typical BARBIE founder spends three to four years doing an undergrad degree, followed by a couple of years working in tech, consulting, or banking before eventually moving back to India. A lot of these founders start up soon after moving back, but a fair number also spend some time working in the ecosystem or their family businesses before venturing out on their own.We tracked the undergraduate alma maters of BARBIE founders. Penn ranks first, followed by Stanford, Michigan, and USC. Penn’s lead is unsurprising given Wharton’s presence and its role as an early cradle of US D2C. In India, the Penn diaspora has gone on to build brands such as Knya, Taali Foods, and The Pant Project.Knya founder Abhijeet Kaji says, “What my time at Penn and Stanford really changed was my relationship with time and ambition. I saw founders and operators who were not in a hurry to 'win' a year, but very intentional about building something that would matter in ten or twenty years. That long-term orientation changes the kinds of decisions you make…and how much you are willing to invest before the outcomes are visible. ”There is also a greater focus and appreciation on design language in many of these brands. Founders often come from fashion, design, or creative backgrounds — enabling them to build brands that feel globally fluent but are distinctively India-first.Second is leverage. Many founders come from families that run businesses in the same or adjacent sectors. Trying to build a new consumer brand is hard in India because of low entry barriers and intense competition. These founders have an unfair advantage as they can leverage their family businesses on either the supply (e.g. a textile manufacturing family business enabling a D2C brand) or demand side (e.g. a family-owned retail chain or distributor becoming the first large buyer).Let’s also address the elephant in the room — privilege. An undergrad degree in the US or UK can cost up to Rs 2.5 crore for a four-year programme, so it is only affluent families who can afford to send their children abroad. That affluence (and the safety net of family businesses in many cases) often influences their decision to come back and take the risk of entrepreneurship. They’re also bolder in challenging the status quo and often end up creating new markets.Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra showed consumers that you can build an ecommerce marketplace from scratch and deliver products to millions of customers within 10 minutes. Anjali Sardana of Pronto is transforming home services by organising a fragmented workforce with professional standards. Pratham Mittal, founder of Masters’ Union and Tetr, is building a completely new kind of educational institution, focused on learning by doing instead of just sitting in classrooms.BARBIE founders also tend to excel at fundraising. As colleges abroad encourage a healthy dose of interdisciplinary liberal arts classes with all the critical reading and writing training that goes with it, they are able to articulate their startup vision with clarity. In the early days of a startup, when you have nothing but a story, the most creative storytellers are the ones that succeed.However, it isn’t all rosy. They have no access to the IIT / BITS networks that are omnipresent in the Indian startup ecosystem. And coming from predominantly English-speaking privileged backgrounds sometimes works against them as they might have real blind spots about how the long tail of India lives and consumes. This is why you might not see a Kuku FM or Meesho being founded by a BARBIE founder. Finally, some investors are biased against this cohort, viewing them as less hungry because they come from privilege — which can be a fair critique in some cases.While global immigration is facing significant headwinds, Indian students still aspire to study abroad. However, the political environment in these countries discourages them from staying on after they graduate. This dynamic suggests that the number and significance of BARBIE founders will only increase significantly in the coming years.","In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK. Many of these students are now returning to build in India. The typical BARBIE founder spends three to four years doing an undergrad degree, followed by a couple of years working in tech, consulting, or banking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127442186,imgsize-838605,width-400,resizemode-4/127442186.jpg"
Cannot dismiss blood pressure as a lifestyle disease and deny disability pension to military officer: High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-dismiss-blood-pressure-as-a-lifestyle-disease-and-deny-disability-pension-to-military-officer-high-court/articleshow/127428957.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: Disability pension to a military officer suffering from blood pressure issues cannot be denied merely by terming primary hypertension a lifestyle disorder, Delhi high court has observed, rejecting the Union govt's challenge to an Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) order that upheld a retired IAF officer's entitlement.""It must be noted that lifestyle varies from individual to individual. Hence, a mere statement that the disease is a lifestyle disorder cannot be a sufficient reason to deny the grant of disability pension unless the medical board has duly examined and recorded the particulars relevant to the individual concerned,"" Justices V Kameswar Rao and Manmeet P S Arora observed.The officer joined IAF in Oct 1981 and was discharged from service in March 2019. His claim for disability pension was opposed by the Centre, which argued that the officer developed the disability in a peace area and that it was neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service. The court observed that the board failed to explain why hypertension was categorised as a lifestyle disorder. ""The medical board must record its reasons and findings while discharging the onus placed upon it,"" the court said.","The officer joined IAF in Oct 1981 and was discharged from service in March 2019.

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

NEW DELHI: Fresh controversy has surfaced around the cancellation of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding with singer-composer Palaash Muchhal, following serious allegations made by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane. Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial misconduct, claiming he was cheated of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project. A formal complaint has been filed in Sangli, Maharashtra.Smriti and Muchhal were initially scheduled to tie the knot on November 23, 2025. The wedding was first postponed citing health emergencies in both families before being officially called off in December 2025.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old alleged that the relationship between Mandhana and Muchhal broke down after a shocking incident during wedding festivities in November 2025.“I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers. The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.”Mane further claimed he is a childhood friend of Smriti Mandhana and was introduced to Muchhal through her family.Mane also levelled allegations of financial coercion against the Muchhal family, stating that he was pressured to invest additional money into a stalled film project.“When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to Rs 1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, communication with the family stopped entirely after the wedding was cancelled.“After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also asserted that he has evidence to back his claims. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal later issued a response through an Instagram story, firmly denying all accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,” Muchhal wrote.Amid widespread speculation over the reasons behind the split, both parties later issued separate statements confirming the cancellation. Smriti stated that she needed to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal said, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”",Smriti Mandhana and Palaash Muchhal's wedding has been called off. Actor- producer Vidnyan Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial misconduct. Mane claims he was cheated of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127357490,imgsize-38140,width-400,resizemode-4/smriti-palash-2401-x.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital, but air quality remained in the “poor” category, with the AQI recorded at 297 at 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Light rain also lashed Ghaziabad and Noida.This marked a marginal improvement from Thursday morning, when the AQI had been in the “very poor” category at 312.Several parts of the national capital continued to register poor air quality, with Anand Vihar at 317, Ashok Vihar 335, Wazirpur 351, Punjabi Bagh 326, RK Puram 315, Bawana 342, ITO 266, Chandni Chowk 326, and Dwarka Sector 8 316, the CPCB reported.Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi was around 16.4°C at 7 am, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Under the AQI classification, readings are categorised as follows: 0–50 ‘Good’, 51–100 ‘Satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘Moderate’, 201–300 ‘Poor’, 301–400 ‘Very Poor’, and 401–500 ‘Severe’.Thursday had been unusually warm, with the mercury soaring to 27.1°C, about seven degrees above normal, marking the warmest January day in seven years.The high temperature was attributed to persistent warm easterly winds and clear skies, which increased sunshine hours.“Westerly winds are cold, while easterly winds are warm during this time of the year,” a weather official explained.With multiple spells of rain expected on Friday, the temperature is likely to drop. Officials said the maximum temperature is forecast to fall to 18-20°C on Friday and further to 16-18°C on Saturday.The rainy spells, accompanied by cloud cover, are also expected to bring down Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) to the poor category on Friday and to moderate by Saturday, if the predictions hold true.The IMD has issued a yellow alert for rain across the city. “Another round of very light to light rain is likely towards the afternoon or evening on Friday,” officials added, advising residents to remain cautious of strong winds and localized thunderstorms.A day earlier, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked all Stage III measures across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect on January 22, following improvements in air quality and favorable forecast trends.A statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said: “The Sub-Committee had invoked Stage III of GRAP on January 16, 2026, after a deterioration in Delhi’s average AQI.” Since then, air quality has shown a downward trend. According to the daily AQI Bulletin from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average AQI improved from 378 on January 20 to 330 on January 21 and 322 on January 22.Considering this improving trend, and based on air quality and meteorological forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the CAQM Sub-Committee convened today to review the situation.","Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital.

US ‘Under Siege’: Emergency In DC, NYC, 14 Other States; Monster Storm Threatens 230 Mn Americans

Air India on Saturday announced the cancellation of all its flights to and from New York and Newark on January 25 and 26, citing forecasts of a severe winter storm with heavy snowfall.In a travel advisory, the airline said a major winter storm is expected to affect New York, New Jersey and adjoining areas along the US East Coast from early Sunday through Monday, significantly impacting flight operations.“Considering the safety of our passengers and crew, all Air India flights to and from New York and Newark have been cancelled on January 25 and 26,” the airline said.Air India added that its teams would provide full assistance to passengers booked to travel on these dates.The airline also shared helpline numbers for further information, asking passengers to contact its 24×7 call centre at +91 11 6932 9333 and +91 11 6932 9999.Meanwhile, harsh winter conditions across the United States have taken a toll on nearly half the population, as a days-long storm system brings snow, sleet, ice, bitter cold and widespread power outages.Forecasters warned that the damage, particularly in areas coated in ice-could be catastrophic and rival the impact of a hurricane.After sweeping through the South, the storm is expected to move into the Northeast, dumping up to a foot (30 cm) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston, according to the National Weather Service.Boston has declared a cold emergency through the weekend, while Connecticut is coordinating with neighbouring New York and Massachusetts in case travel restrictions are required on major highways.","Air India on Saturday announced the cancellation of all its flights to and from New York and Newark on January 25 and 26.

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff. The regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127388943,imgsize-100582,width-400,resizemode-4/ugc.jpg"
Indian seafarers are most abandoned in the world again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-seafarers-are-most-abandoned-in-the-world-again/articleshow/127319128.cms,"Representative image: ANI

LONDON: Indian seafarers are the most abandoned in the world for the third year running.A total of 1,125 Indian seafarers were abandoned on ships in 2025 out of a total of 6,223 seafarers abandoned across 410 ships worldwide, making 2025 the worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.The number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned. In 2023, it was 401. After Indians, the next highest cohort to be abandoned in 2025 were Filipinos (539).India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the Philippines and China.Worldwide the total number of seafarers abandoned has increased by 32% and ship abandonments are up 31% compared to 2024, according to the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), headquartered in London.ITF data shows that seafarers were owed a total of $25.8 million in 2025 as a consequence of abandonment. From this, the ITF has recovered and returned $16.5 million to seafarers.The two countries where most ship abandonments took place were Türkiye and the UAE.Seafarer abandonment is defined as failing to cover the cost of a seafarer’s repatriation; leaving a seafarer without maintenance; or severing ties with a seafarer, including failing to pay wages for at least two months.“It’s nothing short of a disgrace that, yet again, we are seeing record numbers of seafarers abandoned by unscrupulous ship owners,” said David Heindel, chair of the ITF seafarers’ section.An Indian seafarer abandoned with three Indian crew on the “Eleen Armonia”, off the coast of Nigeria, since June, without pay, said: “I can’t sleep from stress, and if this continues I don’t know how it will affect my health. I joined this vessel quickly because the assignment meant I could spend Christmas and New Year with my new daughter and family. I have now missed these and an important family event. As seafarers, it feels really shameful that we’re treated this way. ”Last Sept India’s Directorate General of Shipping blacklisted 86 vessels linked to recurrent Indian seafarer abuse.Three hundred and thirty-seven ship abandonments in 2025 were on vessels sailing under flags of convenience — flags of a country other than the country of ownership. These flags are commonly used by shadow fleets (carrying sanctioned goods) to hide the identity of the real ship owner and are associated with poor safety standards and working conditions.","Number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned.

With the objective of economically empowering women and creating livelihood opportunities, Assam Chief Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday launched the distribution of cheques worth Rs. 10,000 each to 30,806 women under the Mukhya Mantri Mahila Udyamita Abhiyan (MMUA) in the Borkhetri Assembly Constituency of Nalbari district.With this, the scheme has so far benefited 22,28,228 women across 91 Assembly Constituencies in Assam. A total amount of Rs 30,80,60,000 was distributed to beneficiaries in Borkhetri today.Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Sarma urged women from Self-Help Groups selected under the scheme to strive to become a 'Lakhpati Baideu'.He said, ""Although the first instalment of Rs. 10,000 has been provided today, this marks only the beginning of their journey towards becoming financially prosperous. With sustained effort and hard work, they can achieve their goals within the next one or two years.""Highlighting success stories from the constituency, the Chief Minister cited Bijumoni Devi, a member of the Samannay Self-Help Group under Barbhag Development Block, who has become self-reliant through her pickle-making enterprise and now earns around Rs 15,000 per month, amounting to an annual income of Rs 1.80 lakh.Similarly, Anita Thakuriya, a member of the Jeevanjyoti Self-Help Group of Norowagaon, has achieved an annual income of Rs 2.23 lakh through animal husbandry and fish farming.Dr. Sarma added, ""Out of 40 lakh women associated with Self-Help Groups in Assam, more than eight lakh have already become Lakhpati Baideu.

""Such a large women-centric scheme had never been implemented in Assam before,"" he said.Dr. Sarma further stated, ""The government will conduct a door-to-door evaluation after six months. If the funds are properly utilised, beneficiaries will receive Rs. 25,000 in the next phase, followed by Rs. 50,000 in the third year.""He also appealed to beneficiaries to limit the number of children to three to focus better on education and economic activities.Informing about other welfare initiatives, Dr. Sarma said, ""27,663 beneficiaries in Borkhetri are currently receiving benefits under the Orunodoi scheme, and an additional 2,000 women will be newly included.

In an acute stroke, nearly 1.9 billion brain cells are lost every minute if treatment is delayed, making access within the golden hour critical. However, reaching a stroke-ready hospital remains a challenge in rural and difficult terrains.Handing over the units, Rajiv Bahl, Secretary, Department of Health Research and Director General, ICMR, said Mobile Stroke Units—first developed in Germany—have now been successfully evaluated in rural and remote parts of Northeast India. “India is the second country globally to report successful integration of an MSU with emergency medical services for treating acute ischemic stroke patients in rural settings,” he said.The initiative, developed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and guided by Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, aims to ensure advanced healthcare reaches the poorest and most marginalised populations, even in the most challenging geographies.Sharing the state’s experience, P Ashok Babu, Secretary and Commissioner, Health and Family Welfare, Government of Assam, said the handover strengthens the state’s emergency response system and ensures continuity of the life-saving service under state ownership.The MSU functions as a hospital on wheels, equipped with a CT scanner, teleconsultation with specialists, point-of-care diagnostics and clot-busting drugs, enabling diagnosis and treatment at or near the patient’s home.The impact has already been evident. During the pilot and evaluation phase, the model reduced treatment time from nearly 24 hours to about two hours, cut stroke-related deaths by one-third, and reduced long-term disability by eight times. Between 2021 and August 2024, the MSUs handled over 2,300 emergency calls, with 90% of patients treated directly from their homes after integration with the 108 ambulance service.","Stroke is among the leading causes of death and long-term disability in India.

Also on the list were voter-facilitation measures like introduction of mobile deposit facilities at polling stations and capping the number of electors per polling station at 1,200.Highlighting the growing presence of EC on the world electoral map, Kumar said India’s strong and transparent electoral system has drawn global attention.

‘I do not have a birth certificate’

Who may be affected the most

NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has expressed concern over Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal, saying the exercise is ""being done in a hurry,"" further warning that it is ""unjust to voters"" and could jeopardise democratic participation with the state assembly elections just months away.Speaking to PTI from Boston on Saturday, the renowned economist said that while electoral roll revisions can strengthen democracy if done carefully, the current process in Bengal lacks adequate time and fairness.""A thorough review of electoral rolls done carefully with adequate time can be a good democratic procedure, but this is not what is happening in West Bengal at this time,"" Sen said.""The SIR is being done in a hurry, with inadequate time for people with voting rights to have sufficient opportunity to submit documents to vindicate their entitlement to vote in the coming assembly elections. This is both unjust to the electorate and unfair to Indian democracy,"" he added.Recalling his own experience during the revision process, Sen said the time pressure was evident even among Election Commission officials. ""Sometimes, the officials of the Election Commission themselves seem to lack enough time,"" he said.Sen said he was questioned about his right to vote from Santiniketan—his home constituency, despite having voted there earlier and having his details already recorded.""When they questioned my right to vote from my home constituency in Santiniketan - from where I have voted earlier, and where my name, address and other details are registered in official records - they questioned me about my deceased mother's age at my date of birth, even though, as a voter herself, my mother's details, like mine, were stored also in their own official records,"" he added.The economist also highlighted documentation challenges faced by many Indians, particularly those born in rural areas. ""Like many Indian citizens born in rural India (I was born in the then village of Santiniketan), I do not have a birth certificate, and my eligibility to vote required further paperwork to be presented on my behalf,"" Sen said.Although his case was eventually resolved, Sen expressed concern for others who may not have the same support.""Even though I could happily say (like the Beatles) — ‘Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends’ — I worried about others who do not have so many loyal friends. My friends helped me to get through the rigid gates of the formidable EC,"" he said.Sen was summoned for a hearing after a ""logical discrepancy"" was flagged regarding the age difference between him and his mother.Asked whether the SIR could benefit any political party, Sen said he could not make a definitive assessment.""I am not an election expert, so I cannot answer the question with certainty. I have been told by those who seem to know more, that the BJP will benefit from the under-accounting,"" he said, adding, ""I don’t know whether that is true, but the real point is that the EC should not insist on a faulty arrangement and force our proud democracy to commit an unnecessary error, no matter who benefits.""Sen warned that the poor and underprivileged are most at risk of exclusion.""An obvious answer must be the underprivileged and the poor. The documents needed for being allowed into the new electoral roll are often difficult to obtain for the underdogs of society,"" he said.""The class bias that may show up in the necessary requirement of getting and showing particular documents in order to qualify to enter the new voters' list will tend to work against the indigent,"" he added.He also flagged concerns about minority communities, saying, ""Indian Muslims are sometimes relegated to disadvantaged positions through the activism of the recently bolstered Hindutva extremists. Some categories of Hindus also may face discrimination and targeting.""Sen stressed that institutions must act to protect voting rights. ""The EC and the Supreme Court must make sure that no adult Indian citizen has difficulty to qualify for voting,"" he said.Expressing his desire to vote in the upcoming elections, Sen said it would depend on logistics.""I would very much like to do that. It depends, however, on the exact date on which my constituency’s voting is fixed,"" he said, recalling that on one earlier occasion he travelled across three countries within 48 hours just to cast his vote in Santiniketan.","Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has expressed concern over Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal.

.

NEW DELHI: The south district police have arrested an alleged narcotics kingpin and uncovered a ""chemical kitchen"" of sorts that was operating as a factory for manufacturing high-end psychotropic substances like MDMA and heroin . The action to bust synthetic drug distribution in the city led to the arrest of Emmanuel (36), a Nigerian national. He was held with ready-to-sell heroin.The drug lab was inside the suspect's nondescript house in south Delhi's Devli area. A huge quantity of raw material required for synthesising the drugs was seized, besides the processed heroin.According to police, around 16 kg of crystalline material and 16 kg of grey grain-like substances used as bases for drug synthesis were stored in the house.The haul also included 51 kg of liquids stored in multiple containers and 30 unlabelled glass bottles, all intended for the chemical processing of MDMA and heroin. In total, 113 kg of raw materials was recovered. The heroin and MDMA crystals that could have been made using these chemicals would be worth several crores in the international market.DCP (south) Ankit Chauhan said that the breakthrough came on Jan 20, when a team led by ACP Mukesh Walia and SHO Paras Nath Verma arrested the Nigerian national while he was allegedly on his way to sell the processed heroin. The operation was conducted as part of a drive against organised crime and illegal foreigners.""The police teams were on foot patrol when they spotted the suspect. His attempt to evade the police backfired, leading to a search that revealed the cache of premium heroin worth over a crore. However, as the interrogation deepened, it transitioned from a routine drug bust to the uncovering of a sophisticated manufacturing nexus,"" said a senior police officer.During the raid at his house, the cops stumbled upon the chemicals stored in multiple containers. This massive haul of precursors suggests that the accused was not merely a foot soldier or a distributor, but a ""cook"" or supplier in a larger Nigerian gang operation.According to the investigators, the ability to transform raw, industrial-grade chemicals into ""high-quality"" heroin and MDMA marks a shift from simple smuggling to local production, making this bust significant for Delhi Police . Emmanual had been living in India illegally. By hiding in the dense residential pockets of Devli, he managed to operate under the radar. An FIR has been registered against him under the NDPS Act. Cops are conducting an in-depth investigation as the sheer volume of seizure indicates links to an international cartel.Special CP Madhup Tiwari has formed a team under joint CP Sanjay Jain to bust the supply chain and trace the absconding members of this gang.",The drug lab was inside the suspect's nondescript house in south Delhi's Devli area. A huge quantity of raw material required for synthesising the drugs was seized. The heroin and MDMA crystals that could have been made using these chemicals would be worth several crores in the international market.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127340328,imgsize-1237045,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image-ani.jpg"

Reforming SARFAESI Norms to Expand Rural Housing Credit

Bringing Gold Lending Into the Formal Economy

(Shaji Varghese is CEO of Muthoot FinCorp)

India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies. One powerful yet underutilised lever in this journey is household gold. In recent years, the value of household gold has more than doubled, significantly increasing family wealth across India. According to a 2025 Morgan Stanley estimate, Indian households hold nearly 34,600 tonnes of gold jewellery, valued at around $3.8 trillion—almost 89 percent of the country’s GDP. Much of this gold has been accumulated over generations or acquired to mark important life milestones.While gold carries immense emotional and cultural significance, in its idle form it contributes little to economic activity. It is therefore imperative that India deploys effective policies to enable household gold to be used productively—without forcing families to relinquish ownership.Gold loans offer precisely this solution. They allow households to unlock the economic value of gold while retaining emotional ownership, making gold a working asset that supports livelihoods, enterprise, and growth.Over the past few years, regulators have taken meaningful steps to introduce balanced regulations that protect customers while supporting sectoral development.These measures, coming into effect from April 1, 2026, create a stronger foundation. However, to unlock the full potential of gold loans for inclusive growth, further reforms are needed.Credit penetration in rural India remains low, particularly among shopkeepers and MSMEs—estimated at nearly six million nationwide. Many continue to lack access to formal finance, even as they need working capital to upgrade infrastructure, manage inventory, and expand offerings.Gold loans are ideally suited to meet these short-term needs. Interest is charged only for the period the loan is utilised, allowing borrowers to repay when cash flows improve and re-borrow as required. This flexible credit cycle supports business growth, encourages financial discipline, and mobilises household savings in a way that benefits both borrowers and the broader economy.Strengthening Last-Mile Credit Through NBFC Branch ExpansionA key reason for low credit penetration in Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural areas is limited physical branch presence. Over time, NBFCs have demonstrated a superior ability to reach underserved regions, tailor products to local needs, and operate efficiently through well-established models.For gold loans in particular, physical branches are essential and cannot be fully replaced by digital channels, unlike unsecured personal loans. Encouraging NBFCs to expand branch networks would significantly improve access and deepen market penetration.Currently, regulatory restrictions and prescriptive guidelines on branch expansion can slow network growth. Liberalising these norms—especially for collateral-backed products like gold loans—would accelerate outreach while maintaining prudential safeguards.NBFCs play a critical role in last-mile credit delivery, particularly for small-ticket and entry-level loans in rural areas. However, all NBFC loans currently carry a uniform 100 percent risk weight, which raises the cost of lending and limits credit supply.Gold loans are regulated by loan-to-value (LTV) norms, similar to home loans, where risk weights vary based on LTV. Extending a similar risk-based framework to gold loans could unlock significant capital, enabling NBFCs to expand credit availability to deserving borrowers.A coordinated approach between the Government and regulators can help create a supportive policy framework that recognises the broader economic and nation-building potential of expanding gold loan credit.Recent stress in unsecured lending segments, including microfinance, has adversely affected credit scores for millions of households. Many of these borrowers experienced temporary or one-time defaults and are now excluded from formal credit.Targeted schemes are needed to help such borrowers re-enter the formal financial system. Ensuring that temporary distress does not lead to permanent exclusion will allow households to regain access to credit and participate productively in the economy.Housing is a powerful economic driver in rural India, with strong linkages to nearly 50 sectors. While banks offer rural housing loans, their reach in smaller ticket sizes—below ₹10–15 lakh—is limited. NBFCs, with their extensive branch networks, are better positioned to serve this segment.However, SARFAESI Act provisions restrict NBFCs’ ability to recover smaller-ticket secured loans, as enforcement is allowed only for outstanding amounts of ₹20 lakh and above. Harmonising SARFAESI applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies would significantly improve credit flow and accelerate rural housing growth.An estimated 60 percent of gold lending remains unregulated. Formal gold loans, by contrast, operate under clear regulatory guidelines and supervision. Allowing greater flexibility in NBFC branch expansion would accelerate formalisation and extend regulated credit to underserved markets.With a strong regulatory framework already in place, wider branch access can help bring millions of borrowers into the formal financial system.The upcoming Budget presents a timely opportunity to build on existing reforms. With continued policy support and regulatory alignment, gold loans can unlock household wealth, deepen rural credit access, and drive inclusive growth across Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural India.","India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

"Budget 2026: Jewellery sector seeks duty rationalisation, reforms and GST cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-jewellery-sector-seeks-duty-rationalisation-reforms-and-gst-cuts/articleshow/127444748.cms,"Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

For the Union Budget 2026-2027, India’s gems and jewellery industry is urging the government for a mix of GST cuts, customs reforms and policy changes to counter global trade headwinds and improve export competitiveness.In its pre-Budget memorandum submitted to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) highlighted measures aimed at lowering costs for exporters and strengthening India’s role in the global diamond trade and value discovery ecosystem.“The global gem and jewellery trade is undergoing a major transformation. With high US tariffs, evolving consumer preferences, and shifting global supply chains, it is imperative that India maintains its competitive edge,” GJEPC chairman Kirit Bhansali said.According to Bhansali, the proposals focus on enhancing cost efficiency, reinforcing Special Economic Zone (SEZ) operations and improving policy frameworks that support investment and skill development. He said that with supportive reforms and a stable trade environment, India could both withstand current global pressures and drive the next phase of growth in the international jewellery market.The Council flagged concerns over the existing 4% Safe Harbour tax, stating that it remains too high and discourages international trade.The agency also called for rationalisation of import duties on cut and polished diamonds as well as coloured gemstones to help Indian exporters remain competitive globally.In addition, the GJEPC has sought amendments to the Customs Act, 1962, to bring customs procedures in line with the needs of a fast-evolving, export-oriented gems and jewellery sector. Its recommendations include risk-based customs clearance, AI-enabled digital appraisals and self-certification for trusted exporters to improve efficiency, transparency and turnaround time.Separately, the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) has made its own representation to the government, focusing on GST rationalisation, hallmarking, direct tax reforms and sector-wide improvements.“GST on gold and silver jewellery should be rationalised to 1.25 per cent from 3 per cent, which will help restore proportionality, reduce financial stress on households, and enable a wider base of taxed transactions,” GJC chairman Rajesh Rokde said.The GJC has also proposed exempting capital gains tax on exchanges of hallmarked jewellery, provided the proceeds from the sale are immediately reinvested in new jewellery purchases, thereby ensuring continuity of asset holding.Another key demand relates to the Tourist GST Refund scheme. The Council has urged the government to operationalise the scheme at the earliest by notifying the required rules and setting up digital claim and verification systems at major international gateways. It suggested starting with a phased pilot at Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru airports, citing higher levels of jewellery sales and foreign tourist arrivals.“Foreign tourists, particularly from the Middle East, Europe and the United States, face a tax-inclusive price disadvantage while purchasing jewellery in India as compared to regional competitors like the UAE and Singapore, where such refunds are efficiently processed through automated airport systems,"" Rokde said. The expert further highlighted that this results in a lost opportunity for India ""wherein foreign buyers either defer purchases or procure jewellery abroad, converting India's competitive craftsmanship into exported retail demand losses. ”","India’s gems and jewellery industry is urging the government for a mix of GST cuts, customs reforms and policy changes to counter global trade headwinds.

New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani has confirmed that all children in the city, including those who are undocumented, will be eligible for free childcare under the city’s universal programmes.Speaking during a media roundtable, the socialist-Democrat said the initiative covers children under five years old and stressed that these are not programs that are going to ask about the immigration status of any of the children or their parents.Referring to undocumented children, he said: “All of those children are New Yorkers. They should all be enrolled in pre-K and 3-K no matter where they were born and where they come from.”The universal childcare pilot will initially offer no-cost services for children under the age of two in high-need neighbourhoods. The eligibility is based on residency and age rather than income or citizenship. This is aimed at ensuring children are not excluded from early education and allows parents to continue working.However, one major concern was that the policy uses taxpayer money to help undocumented immigrants, questioning its cost, capacity, and fairness.The city has stated that the programme will expand gradually, with long-term funding and rules still under discussion.Mamdani is keen on making the policy a bigger part of New York and its families. He said, “This is one example of a city program that we are encouraging everyone to apply to, to see themselves as a part of and to know that we are going to use every single law that we have here to protect the health and safety of everyone who signs up.”The mayor also spoke about other goals for the city, citing a plan with New York governor Kathy Hochul to ensure “every New Yorker could afford a life of dignity and every family could afford to raise their kids.”Mamdani’s announcement comes amid heightened national attention on immigration enforcement by federal agencies. Earlier this month, a five-year-old child in Minneapolis was briefly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Trump administration, including VP JD Vance defended the action, saying ICE was responding to the child’s father, who was an illegal alien and had allegedly fled.","The universal childcare pilot will initially offer no-cost services for children under the age of two in high-need neighbourhoods. eligibility is based on residency and age rather than income or citizenship.

India, China & The World Move Away From US Treasuries

India’s Treasuries Holdings Drop as Gold Reserves Increase

Why Dependence on Dollar-denominated Assets Is Being Reduced

USD INR Rates & Dollar Index

In a big shift for one of the top five largest economies, India’s holdings of US Treasuries have seen a drop, sliding to the lowest level in five years. The reason for the fall is both need based and strategic: rupee has been depreciating, making it one of the worst performing Asian countries last year. The second reason is to strategically change the composition of foreign exchange reserves, reducing dependence on US assets. In fact, most economies around the world are reducing reliance on the world’s largest bond market.US government data released last week shows that India’s holdings of long-term American debt have fallen to about $174 billion. This marks a drastic 26% drop from the peak which was recorded in 2023. According to the Reserve Bank of India , Treasuries now make up roughly one-third of the country’s forex reserves, down from around 40% a year ago.With gold and other assets accounting for a growing share of reserves, India’s strategy echoes steps taken by bigger holders such as China, according to a Bloomberg report.This has reignited debate over US financial dominance and the status of its debt as a preferred reserve instrument. Fresh trade threats by US President Donald Trump related to Greenland have added to global uncertainty, fuelling speculation that European nations could also pare back their exposure to US Treasuries.Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd., said the trend likely reflects an effort to cut dependence on dollar-denominated assets to reduce sanction-related risks. “There is still room for India to lighten up its Treasuries holdings,” he said.In September, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the RBI was making a “very considered decision” to diversify the country’s reserves.For India and other countries, these lessons have been shaped by the US decision to freeze Russia’s foreign exchange reserves after its war with Ukraine which started in February 2022. India’s decision to continue importing Russian oil has subsequently become a flashpoint with US President Donald Trump. It’s even led to 25% additional penal tariffs being imposed.“The speed at which relations between the US and India deteriorated last year would have taken many by surprise and jolted policymakers to reduce their vulnerabilities,” said Shilan Shah of Capital Economics, who topped Bloomberg’s rupee forecasting rankings last quarter.Yet another factor influencing the shift is the Reserve Bank of India’s effort to shore up the rupee, which has slipped to record lows amid delays in finalising a US-India trade agreement following the Trump administration’s move to impose 50% tariffs on Indian exports, a tariff rate which is the highest in Asia. By cutting back on US Treasury holdings, the central bank can deploy those funds to buy rupees and support the currency.Also read: Trump tariffs, falling rupee: What are the biggest risks to India’s growth story

In financial markets, President Trump’s trade tariffs and the increasing use of the dollar as a sanctions tool have prompted renewed debate over the safety of US Treasuries as a reserve asset, with recent action against Venezuela also reinforcing those concerns.While the RBI is not among the largest holders of US government debt, with its exposure at about a quarter of China’s nearly $683 billion holdings and Japan’s $1.2 trillion portfolio as of November, overseas ownership of Treasuries remains close to record highs. Even so, India’s selling has added fresh momentum to discussions about the place of US sovereign bonds in global investment portfolios.According to the Bloomberg report, central banks around the world are increasingly grappling with a more complicated policy environment that is putting added strain on how reserves are allocated. Although the US dollar and Treasuries continue to dominate as global reserve assets, momentum is clearly building toward diversifying into other options.Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank of India’s reduction in Treasury holdings has come at the same time as a step in gold purchases. In fact, India currently holds the world’s 7th largest gold reserves. Other countries are making similar moves. China and Brazil have lowered their long-term Treasury holdings in October to the weakest levels seen since at least 2011, with China simultaneously stepping up gold purchases.The shift toward gold has gathered pace elsewhere as well. Earlier this week, the National Bank of Poland, currently the world’s largest reported buyer of gold, cleared plans to add another 150 tonnes of the metal to its reserves.There are factors that could slow India’s pace of selling, including a more stable rupee that reduces the need for currency intervention, or an easing of geopolitical stress if the delayed trade agreement is eventually concluded. “If the trade deal materializes, the need for aggressive currency defense could diminish,” said Krishna Bhimavarapu, Asia Pacific economist at State Street Investment Management.Even so, many analysts believe the broader reallocation toward alternative assets is likely to persist. A survey conducted in November by think tank OMFIF showed that while most central banks still hold the dollar, nearly 60% intend to explore substitutes over the next one to two years.“The trend is very much embedded at this point,” Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone in London, said of India’s Treasury sales, adding that a trade agreement “will simply see holdings stabilize, rather than India go on some sort of mass buying spree.”","India’s holdings of US Treasuries have seen a drop, sliding to the lowest level in five years.

The connections between rivers, oceans, glaciers, and groundwater as a one stressed system are receiving more attention. The food supply, commercial routes, public health, and economic stability are all under pressure, frequently simultaneously. In 2026, the UAE will host just the third UN Water Conference in nearly 50 years, raising hopes that long-standing issues may finally find political attention and financial support. The tone is more about acknowledging boundaries that are become increasingly difficult to ignore than it is about declaring crises.At Davos, water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy. Under the Blue Davos label, it is being treated as a core condition for economic resilience and political stability. Briefings point to disruptions across the water cycle that are appearing more often and lasting longer. Flooding, drought and pollution are touching supply chains, energy systems and cities in uneven ways.Bringing oceans and freshwater into the same discussion reflects a broader scientific view that changes in one part of the system tend to echo elsewhere, sometimes far from where they begin.Recent events have made the pattern harder to ignore. In late 2024, rivers in parts of the Amazon basin dropped to unusually low levels, while Spain dealt with its most serious flooding in decades. Similar contrasts appeared in other regions, occasionally within the same country. Water arrives suddenly and destructively in some places, while it retreats for months in others. Researchers often describe this less as a series of isolated shocks and more as a hydrological cycle that is drifting out of balance, shaped by accumulated stress rather than a single breaking point.Longer records reinforce that impression. Since 1900, the share of global land affected by dry conditions has more than doubled, according to OECD data. This expansion strains drinking water supplies and agriculture at the same time. Large lakes offer another signal. Around half of the world’s biggest lakes no longer recover easily after periods of stress. River basins show similar instability, swinging between unusually high and low flows instead of staying within familiar seasonal ranges.Flood risk has increased alongside water shortage. World Bank estimates suggest roughly 1.8 billion people face exposure to significant flooding during a one-in-100-year event, most of them in low and middle-income countries. Even shallow flooding can interrupt housing, transportation, and daily work. These impacts are often felt most severely in areas where sanitation and access to safe drinking water are already unreliable. What emerges is not a single global picture but a patchwork shaped by income, geography and infrastructure.The ocean side of the cycle is shifting as well. Ocean warming has accelerated sharply since the 1980s, bringing effects that include ice loss, rising seas and acidification. Glaciers are losing hundreds of gigatonnes of ice each year. These changes influence weather patterns and coastal economies, sometimes far inland. The scale of these links helps explain why Blue Davos treats marine and freshwater issues as parts of the same problem rather than separate tracks.Water also carries economic weight that is becoming harder to overlook. Estimates place the annual value of water ecosystems at around 58 trillion dollars. Investment, however, has not kept pace. Only a small share of global water funding comes from private sources, leaving gaps in infrastructure and resilience. Projections suggest that close to a third of global GDP could be exposed to high water stress by mid century. These figures are nudging the conversation toward risk and long term stability rather than short term fixes.Some responses are beginning to appear. Water-focused microfinance schemes have helped millions gain access to safe taps and sanitation. Industry groups are testing cooperation at the river basin level, while ocean-related innovation is attracting more investors than in the past. Funding linked to the blue economy has grown quickly over the last decade, driven partly by recognition that degradation carries financial risk. These efforts do not resolve the wider imbalance. They sit alongside uncertainty and long timelines, as attention slowly builds toward 2026.","Water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy.

RAIPUR: In a Janpad Panchayat office in Chhattisgarh’s Koriya district, a discarded piece of paper — creased, torn and thrown away like needless scrap — quietly altered the course of a tribal woman’s life in a remote village. It carried the name of a govt self-employment scheme. For Anjana Oraon, who was, until then, a part-time data entry operator earning Rs 4,000 a month, the scrap of paper became the starting point of a small flyash brick unit kicking off her journey as an entrepreneur.Working at Janpad Panchayat in Khadgawan, Oraon, despite holding a postgraduate degree, earned too little to run a family. When she noticed a torn sheet of paper discarded in the office bin, she read it, kept it, and decided to try her luck under the self-employment scheme. “It was in 2017 when I saw a heap of garbage that the peons had collected after brooming the premises,” Oraon, a resident of village Telga in Baikunthpur, toldIt was in 2017 when I saw a heap of garbage that the peons had collected after brooming the premises. I picked up a torn piece of paper that said, ‘take loan under Pradhan Mantri Srijan Swarozgar Yojana and start your own enterprise’. I decided immediately, I will apply for this loan. There was little encouragement at first. Some advised me to approach the district industries centre, others warned me against getting trapped in banks and paperwork.For a woman with no capital, no business background and no safety net, ambition itself became a liability. But I persisted,” Oraon, a resident of village Telga in Baikunthpur, told TOI.After visiting the district industries centre and touring a fly-ash brick unit in the Podi-Bachra area, she zeroed in on a business that was viable. Fly-ash bricks—linked to the region’s thermal power plants and steady construction demand—offered scale without hype.What followed was a familiar grind: documents, repeated bank visits, loan delays, and social pressure from both her natal and marital families to abandon the idea.“The message was clear even from the bank officials—stick to a “safe” job, however meagre. My husband, Anil Kumar, with no industrial experience, backed the plan. It was after a lot of leg work that a private bank in Baikunthpur, eventually sanctioned a ₹30 lakh loan. Machines were sourced from neighbouring Katghora, a shed was built, fly-ash procured from Korba, and sand and cement arranged locally,"" the woman said firmly.Anjana Enterprises opened in Aug 2025 Since then, the unit has produced around 80,000 fly-ash bricks. The monthly loan instalment—about ₹60,000—is being paid regularly, Oraon said. Alongside the unit, the family continues farming paddy and wheat on four acres of land, managing children, elders and work without abandoning any one role for another.With the demand picking up, Oraon now plans to expand capacity, aiming for 15,000 bricks a day and a monthly turnover of ₹6–7 lakh—targets that will be tested by market cycles and cash flow. Calling her a real source of inspiration, Koriya collector Chandan Tripathi told TOI, “Anjana is an example for women who hold themselves back citing lack of means and resources. By making proper use of govt schemes, Anjana is steadily moving forward on the path of becoming a successful entrepreneur that we can deservingly take pride in. Hers is not just a story but amessage.”She stands as a success story of grassroots women’s empowerment in rural India, and a mindset that can spot opportunity even in what others discard, the Collector said.“The trash gave me my identity,” Oraon said, adding “I filled out the forms, waited through rejection, and made it work—brick by brick.”","Anjana Oraon, who was, until then, a part-time data entry operator earning Rs 4,000 a month, the scrap of paper became the starting point of a small flyash brick unit kicking off her journey as an entrepreneur. “The trash gave my identity,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127446803,imgsize-918631,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/anjana-oraon-and-right-her-fly-ash-brick-unit-in-koriya-district.jpg"

America's push for rare earths

The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment. The package is aimed towards supporting the firm to develop a local mine and magnet production facility, according to two sources familiar with the deal.In addition to this government-backed investment, USA Rare Earth is also securing a separate $1 billion private funding round, which, along with the public announcement, is expected on Monday, Reuters reported. The company will also host a morning conference call with investors to discuss the terms.Rare earth minerals, a group of 17 elements critical for electronics and military equipment, are largely processed by China. The output from United States, however, remains limited, prompting Washington to make efforts to expand domestic production.Under the investment terms, the US government will receive 16.1 million shares in USA Rare Earth, along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares. Both are priced at $17.17 per share, close to the company’s trading level earlier this month.For fundraising support, USA Rare Earth has enlisted Cantor Fitzgerald, chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, a source was quoted as saying by Reuters.At present, USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, in collaboration with Texas Mineral Resources, expected to begin operations by 2028. Its magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is scheduled to start later this year.This latest investment follows previous equity stakes taken by the Trump administration in MP Materials , Lithium Americas , and Trilogy Metals. A senior Trump official told Reuters last month that more “historic deals” with the US mining sector are planned to increase production of lithium, rare earths, and other critical minerals vital to national defence, artificial intelligence, and related industries.","The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment.

Great Indian traffic challan trap: Fake SMS link drains Rs 2.5L from Delhi man over Rs 500 fine; check on official platform to dodge fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/great-indian-traffic-challan-trap/articleshow/127311842.cms,"Delhi Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







NEW DELHI: Received an SMS informing you of a pending traffic challan with a link to pay online? Check it before you click. Cybercriminals are increasingly using fake challan alerts to defraud people. Recently, an elderly resident in east Delhi was defrauded of Rs 2.5 lakh after he clicked on such a fraudulent link to pay a small fine of Rs 500.The victim, a 65-year-old from Laxmi Nagar, told police that his wife had received a message on Jan 13 from an unknown mobile number containing a link for paying a vehicle challan. Believing it to be genuine, she forwarded it to her husband.When he tried to pay using his credit card, the transaction initially appeared to go through normally. But within minutes, another Rs 2,49,246.61 was billed on his card, including SAR 10,350 in Saudi riyals, suggesting international routing. A case has been registered by the cyber police of East district for cheating and personation.Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action. With WhatsApp-based challan alerts now active, scammers send messages on SMS, WhatsApp, even through PDFs.Some claim to be from the transport ministry or pose as transport officials. These messages often pressure recipients to ""process"" the payment immediately via a link that mimics official portals.Such links, QR codes or payment requests from unknown numbers or unverified WhatsApp accounts are a major warning sign as are urgent messages warning of fines, licence suspension or legal action, officers caution. Fraudsters may also ask for payment through third-party apps, agents or unfamiliar websites. They often omit critical details such as notice number, vehicle number and offence location. The messages may try to collect sensitive information through links instead of redirecting to the official Parivahan portal. Once clicked, these links lead to fake gateways designed to steal banking credentials and withdraw funds without authorisation.To protect yourself, pay challans only through official channels. Always verify website URLs before entering any details and check challans using your vehicle or licence number. Authorities also emphasise the importance of the ""golden hour"", the first 60 minutes after a fraud, during which swift reporting can increase the chances of blocking or recovering stolen money.Victims should immediately call the National Cyber Crime helpline 1930, lodge a complaint on cybercrime.gov.in and inform their bank or card issuer to block the account and initiate a chargeback.","Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Satya Nadella says competition is 'keeping us fit'

CEO Satya Nadella says Microsoft avoiding the 'Zero-Sum' trap





During a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum 2026, Nadella said that while the competition with fellow tech giants like Google, Meta and other is fiercer than ever, the expanding role of technology in the global economy makes this a “blessed” time for the industry. His comments came amid a “pretty intense” era led by artificial intelligence (AI) and shifting global markets.“It's a pretty intense time. I mean, so the way I always think is, it's always helpful. When you have a complete new set of competitors every decade, because that keeps you fit,” Nadella said. Reflecting on his 34-year journey at Microsoft, Nadella dismissed the idea that the AI race is a zero-sum game, instead pointing to a future where tech’s share of the world's GDP will only continue to rise.Nadella highlighted that Microsoft’s longevity is rooted in its ability to adapt to new “existential” rivals every decade. He recalled joining the company in 1992 when the primary threat was Novell, further noting that the competition has now changed with its AI rivals“If you think about it, I joined Microsoft in 92 when I had Novell as the big existential competitor. Here we are in 2026, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.It's, quite honestly, at the end of the day, when I look at it right as a percentage of GDP five years from now, where will Tech be right? It will be higher, so we're blessed to be in this industry,” the Microsoft CEO added.While there is a narrative that there’s a winner-takes-all scenario, Nadella insisted that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) tells a different story.“It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum, as some people make it out. Oh, it's getting much bigger, much more. The TAM and it’s just the impact of the stack is going to be so,” Nadella noted.While taking about customer intent, Nadella argued that the key to survival is understanding the “brand permission” a company has with its users.“The question that I always go back to is what’s the brand identity that Microsoft has and the brand permission we have, what customers expect from us,” Nadella noted.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke at the World Economic Forum 2026.

Intel’s turnaround bet faces execution headwinds despite government support





Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan addressed investors with a candid admission on Thursday, saying he's ""disappointed that we are not able to fully meet the demand in our markets."" The chip giant reported a fourth-quarter loss of $333 million and warned of further losses ahead as it grapples with supply shortages and heavy spending to ramp up production.The Santa Clara-based company's revenue fell 3.9% year-over-year to $13.7 billion, missing analyst expectations. Intel shares plunged more than 12% in after-hours trading as investors absorbed the disappointing results and a gloomy first-quarter forecast calling for revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion.CFO David Zinsner pointed to ""industrywide supply shortages"" weighing on results, but also acknowledged Intel's own missteps. The company underestimated demand for CPUs from AI data centers, and is now scrambling to purchase equipment to produce more wafers. The supply crunch will worsen in the first quarter before improving later in spring, Zinsner said.Intel's foundry division remains a significant drag, posting billions in losses. CEO Tan called out disappointing fabrication yields—the percentage of usable chips from each wafer—saying improvements are a key goal for 2026.The company also disappointed analysts by providing no updates on customers for its next-generation 14A manufacturing technology, stating it won't invest in factory capacity until securing a customer commitment.Despite recent momentum—Intel shares had surged more than 150% over five months following government investment and a new partnership with Nvidia—the company continues making what analysts call ""unforced errors."" The first laptops carrying Intel's new 18A chips went on sale in January, and investors are watching adoption of these ""Panther Lake"" processors as a critical indicator of whether the turnaround is working.""We are on a multiyear journey.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday rescheduled the civil suit filed by late industrialist Sanjay Kapur's Rani Kapur over the dissolution of the RK Family Trust, setting the next hearing for January 28. The court noted that the issues involved require detailed examination and a longer hearing.During the hearing, the bench of Justice Vikas Mahajan allowed the parties to submit brief written statements to clarify points arising from their preliminary arguments.Rani Kapur has approached the court challenging the formation and management of the RK Family Trust.In her suit, she alleges that the trust was created and operated without her informed consent, which led to her exclusion from the beneficial ownership of assets she claims were originally hers.According to the plaintiff, the relevant events took place at a time when she was medically unwell following a stroke and was dependent on her son for managing her personal and financial affairs. She has contended that she relied on assurances that her assets remained under her control and were being managed for her benefit.The suit further alleges that her late son either acted under undue influence or was used in implementing the trust arrangement.Rani Kapur claims she was led to believe her estate was secure based on representations made to her, even as transactions were allegedly carried out that diminished her ownership rights.She also alleges that she was made to sign documents without being fully informed of their contents or legal implications, and that some documents were signed in blank. These claims are directed against Priya Kapur and other defendants, who are accused of concealing the true nature and consequences of the trust structure.Through the suit, Rani Kapur has sought the cancellation of the RK Family Trust and the restoration of her estate, asserting that the transactions were carried out through misrepresentation and undue influence, without her informed consent.(With agency inputs)",The Delhi High Court rescheduled the civil suit filed by late industrialist Sanjay Kapur's Rani Kapur over the dissolution of the RK Family Trust.
