Centre's 'Lakhpati Didi' initiative transforming lives of rural women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centres-lakhpati-didi-initiative-transforming-lives-of-rural-women/articleshow/112753457.cms,"JHANSI: In the heart of rural India, a quiet revolution is unfolding, driven by the resilience and determination of women who once confined their aspirations to the four walls of their homes.Through the empowering framework of self-help groups (SHGs) under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), these women are not only transforming their own lives but also setting an inspiring example for others.From managing government ration shops to becoming adept entrepreneurs, these women, now proudly known as ""Lakhpati Didis"" -- women earning over a lakh of rupees through their entrepreneurial efforts are rewriting the narrative of empowerment and self-sufficiency in their communities.Veena, who manages a government ration shop, started her journey when a National Rural Livelihood Mission officer connected her with a self-help group.""When I first got married and came here, I didn't do anything. Then an officer from the NRLM (National Rural Livelihood Mission) came and connected us with a self-help group,"" she said.""After joining the group, we gathered the women and started running the group efficiently. I took on the responsibility of managing the accounts, which slightly increased my income. Later, as I started going out more, I learned about the possibility of running this shop. Since then, we have been running this ration shop,"" she added.Earlier, ration shops were managed by men, and women didn't come out to get the rations. But since women like us started running the shop, the women who used to stay at home now come out to get their rations. Along with that, they also seek advice from us regarding the self-help group, asking about what needs to be done, and we guide them. This has encouraged them to start their own work, Veena added.Earlier, we didn't do anything, but after starting this work, we've seen some benefits and have begun doing more, added Veena.Expressing happiness over Prime Minister Modi felicitating Lakhpati Didi on August 25, Veena said, ""We are very happy that we have reached this point and that we will be honored there. It's a matter of great joy for us. The government schemes that we are getting are helping and benefitting us a lot, and we are progressing significantly.""Hemlata, who owns a clothing shop in Jhansi's Simrawari village, took a loan of Rs 2 lakh from a self-help group to start her business. Over time, her shop's value has grown to Rs 6 lakh and was able to repay her loan.""I first joined the self-help group. After joining, I took a loan of 2 lakh rupees from the group. With that 2 lakh rupees, I opened a shop. Gradually, with those 2 lakh rupees, I kept increasing my stock, selling and purchasing goods. I benefited so much that today, I have a shop worth 6 lakh rupees. I have completely repaid my loan. Recently, during the 8-10 days of Sawan, I sold goods worth 70 to 80 thousand rupees,"" said Hemlata.Before this, we didn't do anything. We stayed at home and only did household chores. When we met with people, they suggested that I open a clothing shop or start some other work. Everyone helped me a lot, Hemlata said.We are very grateful to the government. We thank PM Modi for making every effort to help us move forward and turn women into Lakhpati Didis. It brings us great joy to see women doing excellent work. The women in our self-help group are all engaged in some kind of work, she added.On PM Modi felicitating Lakhpati Didi, Hemlata said, ""I am feeling very happy. Earlier, women didn't do much. They were just confined to cooking and household chores. But now, look at how far women have come. Every woman is progressing through the self-help group.""Sheela Singh, a Vidyut Sakhi, collects electricity bills from homes and assists those unable to visit the office. Sheela says that the government scheme has provided steady work. She earns around Rs 15,000-20,000 monthly, which she says has significantly improved her financial situation.""I work as Vidyut Sakhi. I go from house to house collecting bills. I started this work in 2021, so it's been almost 2-3 years now. I also sit at the electricity department and go door to door for bill collection. For those who are poor and can't come to the office, I visit their homes and give them my phone number so they can call me whenever they need to pay their bills, and I will come to their house to collect the payment,"" Sheela said.""Forms were issued at the Vidyut Vikas Bhawan. I submitted the form, and when my name was selected, I started this work. This has also provided me with financial assistance. I earn approximately Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per month, which has significantly improved my financial situation. With the help of the government scheme, we got work and are now earning. We manage to collect and submit around 1,100 to 1,200 bills every month,"" Sheela added.Manisha Yadav, who works as a Banker Sakhi in Simrawari village of UP's Jhansi said, ""As a Bank Sakhi, I serve as a cadre for the women in the self-help groups, assisting them in opening their group accounts, filling out vouchers, and facilitating CCL (Cash Credit Linkage) for them.""""I used to teach in small private schools. There's been a big change in my work now. Earlier, I would barely earn around Rs 1,000-1,200, but since I started working as a Bank Sakhi, my earnings have increased to Rs 4,000. Additionally, when it comes to paying my children's fees and managing household expenses, I no longer need to rely on anyone else. I can handle everything on my own,"" she added.On PM Modi felicitating Lakhpati Didi, Yadav said, ""I am very happy that we, who used to stay at home and had never seen the outside world, are now managing everything on our own and have become ""Lakhpati Didis.""

"Dhaka blames India for flooding, Delhi hits back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhaka-blames-india-for-flooding-delhi-hits-back/articleshow/112724351.cms,"NEW DELHI/DHAKA: The Indian government on Thursday strongly denied claims in Dhaka that flooding of districts on the eastern borders of Bangladesh had been caused by the opening of Dumbur dam upstream of the Gumti river in Tripura, saying that floods on cross-border rivers is a shared problem on both sides. Indian govt sources also warned the interim govt against any official backing of ""misplaced"" narratives.The warning came in the wake of allegations by one of the advisers to the interim govt, Mohammad Nahid Islam, that India's ""non-cooperation"" was the reason for the flooding.""Without any prior warning and without giving us time for preparation, the dam was opened. Through this India showed an inhuman approach and is demonstrating non-cooperation with Bangladesh,"" Islam said after a meeting of the advisory council with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.Amid cross-border acrimony, there were rumours in Dhaka that Yunus had summoned Indian envoy Pranay Verma. Sources in Delhi, however, said that the request by Verma for a call was lodged several days ago and before the events related to the floods.Nahid, one of the coordinators of the protests against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina, who is supervising information and broadcasting affairs, hoped that India will come out from this ""anti-Bangladesh policy"".""Any official backing of such misplaced narratives is unhelpful to bilateral ties and the use of the word 'summon' is clearly an attempt at disinformation,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.In a statement, the foreign ministry said this problem requires close mutual cooperation, adding India continues to provide real-time flood data to Bangladesh as per a bilateral protocol.With the two countries sharing 54 common cross-border rivers, river water cooperation is an important part of their bilateral engagement. Looking to allay concerns in Bangladesh about India's alleged role in the floods, which followed the political crisis in the country, Indian govt said it remained committed to resolving issues and mutual concerns in water resources and river water management through bilateral consultations and technical discussions.India pointed out that the catchment areas of the Gumti river that flows through India and Bangladesh have witnessed the heaviest rains of this year over the past few days and the flood in the neighbouring country is primarily due to waters from these large catchments downstream of the dam.""Dumbur dam is located quite far from the border - over 120km upstream of Bangladesh. It is a low-height (about 30m) dam that generates power that feeds into a grid and from which Bangladesh also draws 40MW power from Tripura. Along the about 120km river course, we have three water level observation sites at Amarpur, Sonamura and Sonamura 2,"" said MEA .""Heavy rainfall has been continuing since Aug 21 in whole of Tripura and adjoining districts of Bangladesh. In the event of heavy inflow, automatic releases have been observed,"" it added, while recalling that the Amarpur station is in part of a bilateral protocol under which India is transmitting real-time flood data to Bangladesh.""Data showing a rising trend has been supplied to Bangladesh up to 3pm on Aug 21, 2024.

Supreme Court: Fast-track release of undertrials of first-time offenders under new law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-fast-track-release-of-undertrials-under-new-law/articleshow/112749136.cms,"Top Picks For You 6. Now, SC makes way for release of undertrials under new criminal laws

NEW DELHI: In a first, the Supreme Court on Friday gave a retrospective application to Section 479 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita ( BNSS ) that mandates the release of undertrial first-time offenders lodged in prisons if they have served one-third of the maximum punishment prescribed for the offence allegedly committed by them.Though BNSS, along with Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Sanhita, came into force this year, on the request of ASG Aishwarya Bhati, a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Sandeep Mehta said the beneficial provision would apply to all undertrial prisoners irrespective of the date of arrest and their going to prison.The bench ordered jail superintendents to initiate steps for grant of bail to those firsttime offenders who are lodged as undertrials and have served one-third of maximum imprisonment. It asked them to complete the process of making application to the court for release of such prisoners, who fulfil the criteria under Section 479, within 2 months and report back to the state govt’s department concerned.Let the undertrial prisoners who meet the criteria spend this Diwali with their families,” Justice Kohli said. Bhati also requested the court to ask the jail superintendents to take steps for release of undertrial prisoners, who though not first-time offenders but have served half of the maximum punishment prescribed for the offence. However, these two groups of undertrial prisoners would not get the benefit of early release from jail if they have been accused of committing a heinous crime.The bench asked state govts and the administrations of the Union Territories concerned to compile the data of release of these two categories of the undertrial prisoners and submit a status report to the court after two months. It posted the matter for hearing in Oct, by which time Justice Kohli would have retired from Supreme Court.","In a first, the Supreme Court gave a retrospective application to Section 479 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.

Supreme Court lays down when an insult is an offence under SC/ST Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-lays-down-when-an-insult-is-an-offence-under-sc/st-act/articleshow/112749134.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday ruled that insulting or humiliating an individual belonging to the SC or ST community without insinuating about his caste, tribe or the concept of untouchability would not be an offence under the stringent provisions of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra gave this ruling while granting anticipatory bail to Shajan Skaria, editor of an online Malayalam news channel, who was booked under SC/ST Act for calling CPM MLA P V Sreenijan, who belongs to the SC community, a 'mafia don' and was denied pre-arrest bail by trial court and the Kerala high court.Accepting the arguments of senior advocates Sidharth Luthra and Gaurav Agrawal on behalf of the editor, SC said, ""Not every intentional insult or intimidation of a member of an SC/ST community will result in a feeling of caste-based humiliation.""In our opinion, there is nothing to even prima facie indicate that the appellant (Skaria), by publishing the video on YouTube, promoted or attempted to promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will against members of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. The video has nothing to do in general with members of SC or ST. His target was just the complainant (Sreenijan) alone.""Writing a 70-page judgment, Justice Pardiwala said, ""It is only in those cases where the intentional insult or intimidation takes place either due to the prevailing practice of untouchability or to reinforce historically entrenched ideas like the superiority of the 'upper castes' over the 'lower castes/untouchables', the notions of 'purity' and 'pollution', etc that it could be said to be an insult or intimidation of the type envisaged by the 1989 Act.""The intent to humiliate must be construed in the larger context in which the concept of humiliation of marginalised groups has been understood by various scholars, the bench said, adding, ""It is not ordinary insult or intimidation which would amount to 'humiliation' that is sought to be made punishable under the 1989 Act.""Referring to the 'mafia don' reference, the bench said, ""Having regard to the reprehensible conduct and the nature of the derogatory statements made, the appellant (Skaria) at best could be said to have prima facie committed the offence of defamation punishable under Section 500 of the IPC. If that be so, it is always open for the complainant to prosecute the appellant accordingly.""However, the complainant (Sreenijan) could not have invoked the provisions of the Act of 1989 only on the premise that he is member of Scheduled Caste , more so, when a prima facie conjoint reading of the transcript of the video and the complaint fails to disclose that the actions of the appellant were impelled by the caste identity of the complainant.""","Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra gave this ruling while granting anticipatory bail to Shajan Skaria, editor of an online Malayalam news channel.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Remembering a legacy: Death and reflection

A guiding force for the future

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris delivered a powerful tribute to her late mother , Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris , a figure who profoundly influenced her life and career at the Democratic National Convention today. The convention, which has been a showcase of the party’s key figures and their personal stories, saw Harris reflect on her mother’s legacy and its impact on her own journey.""I miss her every day, and especially right now - and I know she's looking down, smiling,"" Harris began, as she accepted the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nomination. She recounted her mother’s remarkable journey from India to the United States, where she pursued a groundbreaking career in biomedical science.Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris arrived in California at just 19 years old, driven by an ambitious dream to become a scientist who would make significant strides in cancer research.Harris also shared the personal aspect of her mother's story, explaining how Gopalan was initially expected to return to India for a traditional arranged marriage. However, fate led her to meet and marry Donald J. Harris, an economist from Jamaica.This union resulted in the birth of Kamala and her sister Maya, marking the beginning of a new chapter in their lives. “When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me,” Harris said.Maya Harris, in her speech, echoed these sentiments, highlighting how their mother’s journey was emblematic of the American dream. She noted that their mother would be immensely proud of Kamala but would also remind her to keep working tirelessly. “Mommy’s journey, and the opportunity that she wanted for Kamala and me - that’s a distinctly American story,” Maya said.Shyamala Gopalan’s contributions to science were significant; she worked as a breast cancer researcher, making notable advancements in the field.Despite her impactful career, she spent considerable time in Wisconsin, where she worked at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The family’s move to Madison, however, was a period that also contributed to the eventual separation of Kamala’s parents.Dr Gopalan passed away in 2009 from colon cancer at the age of 70. Kamala Harris, who was serving as San Francisco's district attorney at the time, made a poignant journey to Chennai, India, to honor her mother’s memory by scattering her ashes.Harris has often reflected on her mother’s influence in her writings and speeches. In her memoir, ""The Truths We Hold,"" she described her mother as the cornerstone of her achievements. “Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything,” Harris wrote.As Harris prepares to accept the Democratic nomination and potentially make history as the first female US president, her mother’s legacy remains a guiding force. Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris, though not physically present at the convention, continues to inspire and shape the trajectory of her daughter’s career and life.With her mother’s influence ever-present, Kamala Harris stands poised to carry forward a legacy of ambition, resilience, and dedication to public service.","Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris delivered a powerful tribute to her late mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris.

The grandstands, described as ""traditional, old-school,"" were constructed in 1937 and extended from behind home plate along the first- and third-base lines. Despite multiple renovations over the years, officials suggested that the presence of aged, dry wood in the structure might have contributed to the intensity of the flames.The ballpark has been a prominent location for various films, such as ""Eight Men Out"" and ""The Babe Ruth Story,"" in addition to ""A League of Their Own,"" which starred Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Lori Petty.
