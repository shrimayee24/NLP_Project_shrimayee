India switches to annual drug drive to end Elephantiasis by 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-switches-to-annual-drug-drive-to-end-elephantiasis-by-2027/articleshow/128188901.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a major push to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, the Centre on Monday rolled out a nationwide annual mass drug administration campaign across 12 endemic states, signalling a decisive shift in strategy to meet its 2027 elimination target.Launching the campaign, Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda said the move from biannual to a single, focused drug round each year aims to improve compliance, strengthen surveillance and overcome last-mile gaps that have slowed progress in several districts.Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a mosquito-borne disease that damages the lymphatic system and can cause irreversible swelling of limbs, hydrocele, disability and social stigma. The disease remains endemic in 348 districts across 20 states and Union Territories.While 143 districts have successfully stopped mass drug administration after clearing transmission assessment surveys, nearly half continue to report infection levels above the elimination threshold. Health ministry data show over 6.2 lakh people living with lymphoedema and more than 1.2 lakh hydrocele cases in endemic areas.The current round of annual drug administration is being implemented in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, covering 719 blocks in 124 districts. The objective is to bring microfilaria prevalence below one percent, the benchmark required to interrupt transmission.India has committed to eliminating filariasis as a public health problem by the end of 2027, three years ahead of the global target. Officials said the redesigned annual campaign will allow uninterrupted monitoring, particularly during the monsoon months when drug delivery and follow-up have traditionally suffered.Addressing state health ministers and senior officials, Nadda said filariasis is not just a medical condition but a disease that erodes livelihoods and traps families in long-term economic distress. He stressed the need for direct observation of drug consumption, stronger vector control and sustained community engagement to counter public hesitancy.The programme also places renewed focus on morbidity management, including hydrocele surgeries and care for patients with chronic swelling. Such surgeries are covered under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme, while Ayushman Arogya Mandirs are expected to support early detection and follow-up care.Officials said steady gains over the past decade, including improved drug compliance and wider district-level coverage, have laid the groundwork for the final push towards a filariasis-free India.","India has committed to eliminating filariasis as a public health problem by the end of 2027.

New Delhi: As the opposition gathered to decide strategy for the upcoming discussion on Budget on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi faced a unanimous demand from allies that he should start the debate, if only to get back at BJP which had not let him speak for seven days. The demand was led by DMK’s T R Baalu and supported by others. But Rahul resisted.He argued that if he stood up to speak, it would result in objections from the treasury benches. And the ensuing commotion would cost every opposition party the chance to speak. He underlined that all regional parties has important issues to raise, and they should not fall prey to “organised disruptions” of BJP.The move won a few hearts in the room, with an ally-critic of LoP Rahul Gandhi later describing it as a “magnanimous” gesture.The meeting was attended by Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge, K C Venugopal, Naseer Hussain and Manickam Tagore, Ramgopal Yadav (SP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Sanjay Raut and Arvind Sawant (SS), John Brittas (CPM), PC Gupta (RJD), Shatabdi Roy (TMC), E T Mohd Basheer (IUML), Rajaram Singh (CPI-ML), among others.That was how the plan was clinched, with the party sticking to Shashi Tharoor to initiate the discussion.Gandhi will speak on the Budget on Wednesday.When the India bloc leaders met in Kharge’s chamber to brainstorm on the future course, the allies decided on ending the logjam.If Gandhi is still blocked from speaking, they would submit the planned no-confidence notice against Speaker Om Birla, and then get on with the stalled business. If Gandhi is allowed, the notice will not be filed.Lok Sabha is now expected to hold normal proceedings.","Gandhi faced a unanimous demand from allies that he should start the debate.

NEW DELHI: India and China underscored the importance of peace and tranquility in border areas for overall progress in ties, while reiterating their commitment to implement the guidance provided by their leaders, including on the need to proceed from a ""political and strategic direction"" on issues and concerns related to bilateral trade.According to an Indian readout, at a meeting between foreign secretary Vikram Misri and visiting Chinese executive vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu, Beijing also conveyed that China understands and respects India's aspirations for UNSC membership. Unlike other countries, China has not explicitly endorsed India's permanent membership bid. In the past, it has only expressed understanding for India's aspirations to play ""a greater role"" in the UN. In 2014 though, in a joint statement after President Xi Jinping's visit, Beijing stated it ""supports India's aspiration to play a greater role in the UN, including in the Security Council"".While this is the first such acknowledgement after the recent military standoff, it still stops short of explicitly endorsing India's case. The Chinese readout did not mention the UNSC membership issue.Ma Zhaoxu was in India to participate in the Brics Sherpa Meeting from Feb 8-10. ""The two sides exchanged views on a wide gamut of issues... Bilateral discussions primarily focussed on the recent progress made in stabilising and rebuilding bilateral ties and ways to take bilateral engagement forward,"" said an Indian readout.Misri noted the successful resumption of Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and hoped for the continued expansion of the scale of the yatra.

The intention is not to criticise or cast doubt on past judgments but merely to show how stereotypes may unwittingly be employed.

At the end of the day, all parties are in pain, they are grieving and all of you suffered. Lead a good life rather than fight,” Justice Pushkarna said.Sunjay, 53, died in London in June last year.The judge asked the senior counsel appearing for Sunjay’s mother, his wife and his sister to sit down together to solve their issues in a manner in which everyone’s interests were safeguarded. “All of you should try to respect relations… The way forward is resolution in a peaceful manner. Efforts need to be from both sides,” Justice Pushkarna observed orally.The HC was dealing with a lawsuit by Sunjay’s mother Rani Kapur for a purported family trust to be declared “null and void”. In her lawsuit against daughter-in-law Priya and others, 80-year-old Rani alleged that the trust, constituted in Oct 2017, was a product of “forged, fabricated and fraudulent” documents, and that she was wrongly divested of all her rights, assets and legacy.The high court also highlighted the need for Priya to realise it was Rani’s husband (Surinder Kapur) who “founded everything”, and the fruits of his labour should be shared by all.The HC issued notice to Priya and others on a plea by Rani to stay disbursal of dividends from a group company to her daughter-in-law and to preserve the estate. It also sought her stand on Priya’s claim that the suit be rejected.Rani’s suit says she is the sole beneficiary of the entire estate belonging to her late husband, Surinder, who was the promoter of various businesses, including Sona Group of Companies, and a “systematic fraud” was committed on her when the assets were transferred to the “RK Family Trust”.A separate plea by the two children of actor Karisma Kapoor, Sunjay’s former wife, challenging the authenticity of the purported will of their late father is also pending in the HC.","Delhi HC advises family of late industrialist Sunjay Kapur to go for mediation.

NEW DELHI: World-renowned astrophysicist Prof Duncan Lorimer, who led the discovery of the first Fast Radio Burst (FRB) as among the brightest and most mysterious radio pulses in the universe, said here on Monday that the “universe is expanding” and that with “new and improved telescopes coming up in the US and Canada, we can find out more deep mysteries of this universe”.A fast radio burst (FRB) is an intensely bright, millisecond-long flash of radio waves originating from deep space, often from billions of light-years away. These fleeting, high-energy events emit as much energy in a fraction of a second as the sun does over several weeks.The first FRB was discovered by Lorimer and his student David Narkevic in 2007 when they were looking through archival pulsar survey data, and it is, therefore, commonly referred to as the ‘Lorimer burst’.During a discussion on ‘The Brightest Pulses in the Universe’ at the PM Museum and Library (PMML), Nehru Planetarium here, Lorimer, a fellow of the Royal Society, and professor of physics and astronomy at West Virginia University, USA, lauded two Indian researchers and his colleagues— Shamil Chatterjee and Shriharsh Tendulkar — for playing significant roles in identifying the host galaxy and origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts .Duncan Lorimer and his wife Maura McLaughlin had received the Shaw Prize, described as the “Nobel Prize of the East”, for helping discover FRBs.Whenasked the astrophysicist of any possibility of aliens trying to contact humans from other parts of the universe through different radio frequencies, Lorimer said, “There is a possibility that some fractions of fast radio burst might have an unexpected phenomenon. If we dig deeper into the data as we get tens and thousands of signals, we might find some that are anonymous. There might be some components in future (with links to aliens). I might not have seen it directly till now.”On the divided opinion of scientists about the real characteristics of alleged interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS that had entered the Milky Way galaxy last year, Lorimer stayed away from the controversy, saying, “I did not follow that story, so I don’t have an opinion on it.”While interacting with students, Lorimer explained to them the origin and characteristics of neutron stars, deep holes and radio bursts from different galaxies.Highlighting the significance of the event, Ashwani Lohani, director, PMML, said: “It is a great privilege for PMML and Nehru Planetarium to host Prof. Duncan Lorimer. This interaction is a wonderful opportunity for students, young researchers, and the wider public to engage directly with a scientist whose work has transformed our understanding of the universe. Such events inspire curiosity, scientific temper and a deeper appreciation of India’s growing engagement with global science. ”","World-renowned astrophysicist Prof Duncan Lorimer led the discovery of the first Fast Radio Burst.

Age relaxation: The ability to deduct the years of military service plus three years from their actual age for civil job eligibility,” the ministry said.

She had then approached the HC, pointing out that MNS was an “Armed Force of the Union” under the statute and that the Punjab ESM rules covered short service officers released on completion of terms of engagement with gratuity under the definition of ESM.","The notification of Ex-servicemen (Re-employment in Central Civil Services & Posts) Amendment Rules 2026 under Article 309 of the Constitution, which came into effect on Feb 9, will boost rehabilitation and second-career opportunities.

Mismatch in fertiliser DBT buyers and PM-KISAN data raises red flags for panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mismatch-in-fertiliser-dbt-buyers-and-pm-kisan-data-raises-red-flags-for-panel/articleshow/128170178.cms,"File photo (for representative purpose only)

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over the diversion of subsidised fertilisers, a parliamentary panel has recommended that the govt expedite the integration of Aadhaar authentication with a comprehensive “farmer’s registry” to ensure better targeting of fertiliser subsidies and prevent unauthorised buyers from exploiting the system.The Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers, in its report submitted to Parliament on Tuesday, noted the fertiliser department’s submission that its Integrated Fertiliser Management System (iFMS) portal has “identified approximately 18.7 crore unique buyers under the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system and 6.25 crore buyers have availed the fertiliser subsidy till Jan, 2025 which contradicts the farmer population when compared with the PM-KISAN database of agriculture ministry, which records 9.8 crore farmers”.It said this highlights the need for further scrutiny to identify genuine beneficiaries.The panel headed by Congress MP Kirti Azad recorded its concern that buyer identification under the DBT in fertiliser subsidy scheme is established only through Aadhaar authentication on a ‘no denial basis,’ without a well-defined mechanism to ascertain the actual beneficiary.“As a result, subsidised fertilisers, particularly urea, are susceptible to diversion for stocking, black-marketing, and use in industrial sectors such as resin/ adhesives, plastics/ foams, textiles/ leather, and paper/ pulp industries.It is apparent that different syndicates might be functional in this field to benefit from the shortcomings of the DBT system in place allowing purchase of subsidised fertilisers in connivance of implementing agencies creating shortages and black-marketing,” it said.As per the current provision, each beneficiary can purchase up to 50 bags of subsidised fertiliser per month.Taking note of the efforts made by the department to explore the use of the PM-KISAN database and integration of the farmer’s registry with the digital platform of fertilisers department, it has recommended that all necessary measures should be taken for early integration of iFMS platform with farmers’ registry incorporating landholding, cropping patterns, and soil health data besides broadening the Direct Cash Transfer (DCT) Scheme to select districts of different regions to correctly understand the fertiliser purchase behaviours of farmers for a comprehensive understanding of the constraints in the DBT.The panel has recommended that necessary modifications should be made to the DBT system to ensure that benefits percolate directly to both landowners and landless farmers who cultivate leased land.","The Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilisers, in its report submitted to Parliament on Tuesday, noted the fertiliser department’s submission.

Assam final electoral rolls published: Over 2.43 lakh names removed ahead of assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-final-electoral-rolls-published-over-2-43-lakh-names-removed-ahead-of-assembly-elections/articleshow/128167059.cms,"Election Commission of India (ECI)

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday published the final electoral rolls for Assam after the Special Revision (SR) exercise. Over 2.43 lakh names were removed from the draft list ahead of the Assembly elections due in the coming months.According to a statement issued by the office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Assam, the final voter list now includes 2,49,58,139 electors, marking a 0.97 per cent decline from the draft roll published on December 27 last year. The draft list had recorded 2,52,01,624 voters.The final roll comprises 1,24,82,213 male voters, 1,24,75,583 female voters and 343 third-gender voters, the CEO’s office said.The deletions followed the completion of the claims and objections process under the SR exercise. During verification, authorities identified 4,78,992 deceased electors, 5,23,680 voters who had shifted residence and 53,619 cases of multiple entries. These changes were reflected only in the final roll after due process.The Special Revision exercise had earlier shown a 1.35 per cent increase compared to the previous final roll published in January 2025, before subsequent verification-led deletions.The CEO’s office clarified that electors whose names were removed on the grounds of having “permanently shifted” still have legal remedies available.Under the Representation of the People Act, 1950, affected voters can appeal against deletion within 15 days to the district magistrate and file a second appeal within 30 days to the Chief Electoral Officer.Eligible voters who could not apply for address changes earlier, especially those displaced due to eviction drives or administrative actions can now apply for re-inclusion at their new address, officials said.“If they could not apply for shifting of their names before deletion, they can now apply for inclusion under the RP Act,” an election official told PTI.The CEO has issued detailed instructions to all district election officers (DEOs) in this regard. The letter highlights that during the SR process, some voters were removed as “permanently shifted” but could not submit the required forms because only one application can be processed during a single revision cycle.Such voters may now submit Form 6, meant for inclusion in the electoral roll, provided they were unable to file Form 8 earlier due to an ongoing objection or deletion process under Form 7. Officials have been directed to conduct rigorous verification to ensure that no ineligible voter is added while safeguarding the rights of eligible citizens.The SR exercise, however, triggered political controversy in Assam. Opposition parties alleged that the revision was being misused for “vote theft” and claimed that genuine citizens particularly from a religious minority community were being harassed.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier stated that notices were being issued mainly to “Miyas” to keep them “under pressure” and claimed that BJP workers had filed more than five lakh complaints against alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.The term “Miya,” historically used as a pejorative for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam, has in recent years been reclaimed by sections of the community as a symbol of assertion.Meanwhile, the Election Commission also provided an update on electoral roll revision in West Bengal. The ECI has extended timelines for the state’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR), pushing the final publication date to February 14 citing extensive enumeration work and the need for polling station rationalisation.In West Bengal, house-to-house verification concluded on December 11 last year, draft rolls were published on December 16 and claims and objections were accepted until January 15.Reiterating its stand, the Election Commission urged citizens across states to actively participate in roll revision exercises, stressing that accurate and updated electoral rolls are essential for free and fair elections.","The final voter list now includes 2,49,58,139 electors, marking a 0.97 per cent decline from the draft roll published on December 27 last year.

BJP Accuses Mamata of Misleading Nation After SC SIR Ruling, TMC Counters Claims

NEW DELHI: The election commission on Tuesday extended the special intensive revision (SIR) deadline in poll-bound West Bengal by two weeks.The roll revision in the TMC-ruled state will go on till February 21, and rolls will be published on February 28.In a letter to the Chief Electoral Officer of West Bengal, the Election Commission said the decision was taken in compliance with the Supreme Court’s February 9 order.Earlier, the final voters’ list was scheduled to be published on February 14, with elections to follow after completion of the exercise.""...in compliance of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's direction, the Commission has decided to revise the programme of ongoing SIR in the State of West Bengal as follows,"" the letter said, according to news agency PTI.Under the revised schedule, hearings on notices will conclude by February 14. Scrutiny of documents and disposal of cases will be completed by February 21.Rationalisation of polling stations is set to be finished by February 25, while health parameter checks will conclude by February 27. The final electoral roll will now be published on February 28, according to the letter shared by the CEO.Supreme Court said Monday it would under no circumstances allow stalling of special intensive revision (SIR) of voter rolls in 12 states, but said it was open to suggestions to ensure genuine voters are not left out.The CJI-led bench extended by a week the February 7 deadline for submission of documents by voters issued notice by EC, including 1.36 crore voters categorised under ""logical discrepancy"".It also sought a personal affidavit from the Bengal DGP on EC’s charge of TMC functionaries making attempts to derail SIR. “We hope the state remembers the laws of the land,” it said.The bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria, which had heard West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee passionately argue for discontinuing SIR, frowned upon the state govt for not providing the names of 8,500 group B cadre officials to EC for assisting electoral revision officers (EROs) and assistant EROs in the massive document verification work.The displeasure had a dramatic effect as the West Bengal government provided the list within minutes to EC in the court and said it would verify the suitability of the officials.The court also dismissed the fear expressed by Banerjee’s counsel Shyam Divan who told the bench that the process adopted by EC would lead to mass exclusion of voters given the fact that 50 per cent of the cases of voters facing “logical discrepancy” scrutiny are misspelling of names, which happened due to translation errors.“This is a speculative apprehension,” the bench said, and allayed it by saying suitable officials, inducted by EC from among the 8,500 officers provided by the state government, would assist the EROs and AEROs about the cases where notices have been issued merely because of spelling errors in names and facilitate their inclusion in voter lists.","The roll revision in the TMC-ruled state will go on till February 21, and rolls will be published on February 28.

The platform currently operates in Delhi NCR (Delhi, Gurugram, Noida) and parts of Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Somnath, Dwarka).As per the latest data cited by PIB, the app has 990,082 registered customers and over 3 lakh drivers, completing 291,665 rides.Bharat Taxi follows a zero-commission model, with direct profit distribution to drivers, offering an alternative to investment-driven aggregator platforms. While no platform or convenience fees are charged to riders or drivers in-app, a 7% service charge applies at airport prepaid booths to cover operational costs.The platform also focuses on social security for drivers, including health and accident insurance, retirement savings, emergency assistance, and dedicated support centers.It allows drivers to work on other platforms without exclusivity and promotes women’s participation through initiatives like “Bike Didi,” which has already onboarded over 150 women drivers.Looking ahead, the ministry plans a nationwide rollout by 2029, with dedicated help centers in every state, enhanced social security for drivers, and integration with national digital public infrastructure to create a cooperative-driven mobility ecosystem, Amit Shah said.","Bharat Taxi is India’s first cooperative-led ride-hailing platform.

Is India less alarmed by Donald Trump than the West? Here's what survey says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-india-less-alarmed-by-donald-trump-than-the-west-heres-what-survey-says/articleshow/128155646.cms,"Zero Tariffs For No Russian Oil? White House’s India-US Trade Deal Factsheet Clarifies What’s Real

What the report says

Era of 'wrecking-ball politics'

As much of the Western world recoils from Donald Trump ’s return to the White House, India’s reaction looks strikingly different. The Munich Security Report 2026 presents Indian public opinion on US President Donald Trump as distinct from that of most Western democracies, marked by relatively higher approval of his policies, rising concern about US economic coercion, and declining belief in the necessity of US global leadership.Around 38% of Indian respondents agreed that Trump’s policies were good for India, and approximately 36% agreed they were good for the world. These levels of agreement are significantly higher than in Canada, France, Germany, and Japan, where agreement typically remains in the low teensAccording to the MSI, India ranks among the more favorable countries when respondents were asked whether “Donald Trump’s policies are good for my country” and “good for the world.”The report noted that Indian respondents were less critical of Trump than Western public and more likely to express conditional or partial approval of his approach, even when uncertainty remains about its global impact.While Indian views of Trump’s geopolitical impact were comparatively less negative, the report recorded greater concern regarding his economic policies. Trump administration imposed 50% tariffs on India.With the recent India-US trade deal, the additional 25% tariffs was brought down to 18%.The report stated that the US risk score for India increased by 18 points between 2024 and 2025, the largest increase recorded among all risks in the Indian profile. Despite this rise, the US did not rank among India’s top perceived threats; China remained a higher concern, while Russia was viewed as comparatively low risk.The findings are based on the Munich Security Index (MSI), which surveys public attitudes across G7 and major Global South countries.The report framed Trump as a central figure in what it called an era of “wrecking-ball politics,” characterized by challenges to multilateral institutions and the post-1945 liberal order.In the Indian case, the report highlighted long-standing skepticism toward the Western “rules-based order,” which policymakers have criticized for selective application and double standards.The report cited external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s assessment that the existing order has often appeared “anarchic and permeated by double standards” from a Global South perspective. Within this context, the report suggested that Trump’s challenge to established institutions was not uniformly perceived as negative in India.","The Munich Security Report 2026 presents Indian public opinion on US President Donald Trump as distinct from that of most Western democracies.

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress on Tuesday refused to sign a no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, saying opposition should first approach the Speaker with its grievances, including the suspension of eight Congress MPs.Explaining the reason behind the move TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee said his party has “no problem” signing a no-confidence motion against the Speaker, but asserted a dialogue with the chair before any action, giving him an opportunity to clarify his position.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament House complex, Banerjee said the Speaker should be given an opportunity to respond before the opposition moves a resolution seeking his removal. While opposition parties submitted a notice earlier in the day accusing Birla of “blatantly partisan” conduct, the TMC chose not to be a signatory to the move, reported PTI.“The All India Trinamool Congress has no problem signing the no-confidence motion against the Speaker. All 28 MPs will sign it,” Banerjee said. “However, before moving the no-confidence motion, we want all the INDIA bloc partners to sign a letter addressed to the Speaker, highlighting the four points on which the argument is based.”Citing the suspension of eight Congress MPs, Banerjee said the opposition could appeal for reconsideration and give the Speaker “two to three days’ time” to respond. “If the Speaker does not act or fails to provide satisfactory responses to the four issues, a no-confidence motion can be introduced after three days,” he said.Opposition parties, including the Congress, Samajwadi Party and the DMK, submitted the notice to Lok Sabha secretary general Utpal Kumar Singh through Congress leaders Gaurav Gogoi, K Suresh and Mohamed Jawed.The resolution alleges that Birla acted in a “blatantly partisan” manner and made “blatantly false” allegations against Congress MPs.The TMC leader said his party wants Parliament to function and questioned repeated adjournments of the House.“We want the House to function properly, but it appears the Union government does not,” Banerjee said, adding that the Speaker also shares responsibility for ensuring smooth proceedings.According to sources, around 120 MPs from parties such as the Congress, DMK, Samajwadi Party, Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP) have signed the notice."," Trinamool Congress refuses to sign no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.

Full implementation expected to follow once technical, security and biometric systems are linked across all member states.

Who is eligible to apply for the GCC Unified Visa?



A valid passport with sufficient remaining validity (typically six months minimum).

Supporting documents like proof of accommodation and return/ onward travel.

Travel insurance covering all GCC states may be required.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

A unified visa promotes the GCC as a single tourism destination, enhancing its competitiveness with regions like Europe and ASEAN. Simplified logistics: Digital applications and harmonized border systems reduce wait times and bureaucratic friction.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region.

New Delhi: The Yamuna is once again blanketed with thick white froth at Kalindi Kunj, an unmistakable and alarming visible proof of severe pollution that has quietly returned to the river stretch in Delhi. While both stench and foam are back, the urgency to remediate them is missing.Unlike last Oct, when Delhi govt swung into action ahead of Chhath Puja with daily inspections and heavy freshwater releases from Hathnikund Barrage, the current response is marked by silence. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) is also yet to release any river water quality assessment for Jan or offer any explanation for the delay.The Yamuna pollution had dominated public discourse during the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections, with parties sparring over sewage treatment failures and river rejuvenation promises. The massive freshwater releases from Hathnikund Barrage had temporarily diluted pollutants last Oct, banishing froth and odour, but it remained cosmetic and event-driven.""Wastewater is not being treated. That's why frothing is visible again,"" said environmental activist Pankaj Kumar.""In Oct, the river had nearly 10 cusecs of freshwater flow. Now it is virtually nil. Almost all wastewater generated in Delhi-NCR is reaching the river untreated or poorly treated,"" he alleged.Experts point out that structural factors worsen the problem. The ITO gates remain permanently open while barrages like Kalindi Kunj trap pollutants like surfactants and phosphates.TOI reported in Jan how experts raised questions over the credibility of DPCC's Yamuna reports for Nov and Dec 2025, which were also delayed. While the reports claimed improvement compared to last year, several indicators did not align with ground reality. For instance, at Kalindi Kunj, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) — the river's capacity to heal itself — reportedly improved in Nov and Dec, even as frothing and stench returned after freshwater releases stopped.""How can the river appear visually clean in Oct, but show worse BOD readings than Nov and Dec when froth returned?"" Kumar asked, calling the data ""illogical"".Several drains also recorded BOD levels exceeding 100mg/l, yet corresponding river stretches showed improvement in official data. TOI had reported the same in Nov 2025 and this Jan while DPCC did not respond to queries.Environmentalists warn that with the river out of the political and festive spotlight, monitoring appears to be slipping. Central Pollution Control Board does not independently assess the Yamuna in Delhi and relies on DPCC's data.""The Yamuna was treated like a tap — turned on for elections and festivals, then shut off,"" said river activist Bhim Singh Rawat. ""Without year-round environmental flows and functional sewage treatment plants, frothing will remain a permanent feature.""Centre, however, along with Delhi govt, recently reviewed three dam projects on the Yamuna — Lakhwar in Uttarakhand, Renukaji in Himachal Pradesh and Kishau on the border of both states. The projects, stalled over 25 years, are expected to bring e-flow to the river, diluting pollutants. Even in Oct, the pollution level was way above standards.","The Yamuna is once again blanketed with thick white froth at Kalindi Kunj.

Paying rent in Bengaluru? Your tax math may change with proposed 50% House Rent Allowance exemption,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/paying-rent-in-bengaluru-your-tax-math-may-change/articleshow/128184400.cms,"Bengaluru joins metro list for HRA, salaried class set for bigger tax break (Representative image)





BENGALURU: Salaried workforce of Bengaluru is set for a significant tax relief with the draft Income Tax Rules, 2026, proposing to place the city in the category eligible for 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption.The benefit, until now reserved for Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, would bring Bengaluru on par with the traditional metros and raise the deduction ceiling from the present 40%. Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad have also been included in the expanded list. The change, once notified, is expected to help lakhs of employees coping with steep rentals in the technology capital.As per the I-T Act, 1961, salaried employees can claim exemption of HRA in their salary tax computation, and the the least of the following is exempt: ""Actual HRA received; 40% of basic salary plus dearness allowance [50% in case of employees working in metros]; excess of rent paid over 10% of salary"".The difference may appear small but translates into tangible savings. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that for a worker with a basic salary of Rs 30,000 a month, the higher limit would raise the exempt amount by Rs 3,000, offering annual tax savings close to Rs 10,000 for those in the 30% bracket.In Jan 2024, TOI ran a campaign for Bengaluru's inclusion in the list of metro cities, which offers the additional HRA exemption.While the new draft rules don't explicitly call Bengaluru as a ""metropolitan city', it has added its name in the list that so far had only the four metro cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya, describing it as the result of years of representation, said it was a ""big bonus"". Surya has been advocating that Bengaluru be added to the metropolitan cities' list under I-T rules since 2020.""Having closely seen how my father, a regular salaried employee, struggled with HRA, this campaign was also personal to me. Bengaluru, as a city, merits to be added to the list of metros and I'm happy that I had a role to play in it. It has been a persistent effort,"" Surya told TOI on Tuesday.The decision marks a reversal of the position the Union finance ministry had taken barely 18 months ago. In Aug 2024, as reported by TOI, Parliament was told that adding more cities to the metro list would run against the govt's policy of rationalising exemptions. That stand had drawn criticism from Karnataka leaders and industry voices who argued that the rules reflected an outdated view of urban India. Bengaluru, despite being a major contributor to I-T collections and home to one of the country's largest salaried populations, remained outside the privileged bracket.The inclusion carries symbolic weight. Business leaders have long said that global investors already treat Bengaluru as a metropolis even if the tax code did not. With the new rules, the city finally receives formal recognition that aligns policy with its economic stature and the daily costs borne by its residents. The draft rules also allow higher transport allowance of up to Rs 15,000 for employees with disabilities in the notified cities.","The draft Income Tax Rules, 2026, proposes to place Bengaluru in the category eligible for 50% House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption.

Over 2L names deleted from Assam final rolls; nearly 50% voters women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/over-2l-names-deleted-in-assam-sr-nearly-50-voters-women/articleshow/128171514.cms,"Assam's final electoral rolls show a rare contraction of over 2.43 lakh names, reflecting a rigorous purification process

GUWAHATI: Assam’s final electoral rolls published on Tuesday showed a rare contraction from the draft list, with more than 2.43 lakh names removed during special revision (SR), even as the state’s electorate reached nearly 2.5 crore voters, an increase of over one crore in the past 25 years.In percentage terms, the final electoral rolls recorded a 0.97% decline compared to the draft rolls published in Dec last year. Officials said the decrease reflected a more rigorous purification process that led to the removal of duplicate entries and names of deceased voters.“If one has to justify the decrease in the number of voters compared with the draft rolls, it is because in earlier summary revisions the draft rolls were updated based largely on voluntary information — such as reports of deaths, new eligibles, or voters shifting residence on their own. This time, during the special revision, we went house-to-house to update the draft voters’ list, and hence the rolls underwent greater purification,” an official said.The most striking feature of the final rolls is the gender balance. After decades of male dominance, Assam is entering its first election cycle with near-perfect gender parity, with women accounting for 49.9% of the electorate, trailing men by only about 6,630 voters.Historically, the male–female gap hovered between five lakh and seven lakh voters. In 2001, men outnumbered women by over five lakh. By 2016, the gap had widened to 6.78 lakh. The tide began to turn in 2021, when women narrowed the gap down to 3.22 lakh.Over the past quarter century, Assam’s electorate has undergone a remarkable transformation. From 1.4 crore voters in 2001, the rolls have expanded to nearly 2.5 crore in 2026, registering a 73% growth. This reflects both demographic change and sustained enrolment drives, though the pace has varied across periods.The biggest surge came between 2001 and 2006, when the rolls grew by more than 20%, while the slowest phase was between 2006 and 2011, with growth of just over 4%. More recently, the electorate expanded by 15.7% between 2016 and 2021, before moderating to 8.6% in the latest cycle.Taken together, Assam’s electoral journey tells a dual story: steady expansion of the voter base alongside a narrowing gender gap. The numbers reflect not just demographic growth, but a reshaping of the electorate itself — one that is larger, more inclusive, and more balanced than ever before.Meanwhile, officials said eligible voters, whose names were deleted from their previous polling stations or constituencies on the grounds of having ‘permanently shifted’ from their earlier places of residence due to evictions or other reasons, can now apply for inclusion at their new addresses.","The final electoral rolls recorded a 0.97% decline compared to the draft rolls published in Dec last year.

From grainy pics to forensics: Inside Delhi police unit that finds missing people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/from-grainy-pics-to-forensics-inside-police-unit-that-finds-missing-people/articleshow/128170499.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Head constables Amit and Upender sit before a flickering computer monitor at the nodal headquarters of the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) in Rohini, their eyes scanning a grainy photograph of a teenager who vanished from a bus terminal in Delhi three years ago. For them, this isn't just another file in a mountain of paperwork; it is a puzzle that spans the breadth of the country.Over their two-year-long tenure at the unit, they have developed a sixth sense for the digital breadcrumbs left behind by the missing. They move seamlessly between the ZIPNet portal and the Vatsalya database, cross-referencing blurred CCTV stills with records from child care institutions (CCIs) in West Bengal and Odisha.Both are part of the AHTU under Delhi Police crime branch, a force that has turned the desperate search for the lost into a data-driven science of reunion. The genesis of this specialised unit dates back to 2014, following a directive from the Union home ministry to create a bulwark against human exploitation. What began as a focused response to human trafficking has evolved into a sophisticated 18-unit network that blankets the NCT of Delhi.From the bustling corridors of Indira Gandhi International airport to the sprawling railway terminuses, the AHTU operates with a mandate that covers the darkest corners of urban life: kidnapping, abduction, child labour, sexual abuse, and the rescue of those forced into begging. Stationed at Sector 16, Rohini, the AHTU acts as the central nervous system for these operations, coordinating with district units and non-governmental organisations to ensure no child falls through the cracks of a fragmented bureaucracy.For police commissioner Satish Golcha and special CP (crime) Devesh Srivastava Police, the AHTU is a high-priority unit that functions with a lean but elite force of inspectors, sub-inspectors and subordinate staff who treat every missing person report not as a statistic, but as a ticking clock.The AHTU's methodology is a blend of rigorous legal enforcement and empathetic social intervention. When a minor goes missing in Delhi, the machinery of the AHTU begins to grind within minutes. The law dictates the immediate registration of an FIR, but the unit's internal protocols go further.Within 24 hours, the details of the missing child are broadcast across ZIPNet and the Vatsalya portal, making the information instantly accessible to every police station in the city. This digital net is cast wide, involving the State Crime Records Bureau, the National Crime Records Bureau and the CBI, when necessary.The most effective work often happens on the ground though. Officers like assistant sub-inspector Gopal Krishan, who has spent seven years in the unit, know that the digital trail is only half the battle. Krishan has personally traced more than 750 missing or kidnapped persons, often travelling to remote villages in Bihar or Rajasthan to follow a lead. His work has earned him six Asadharan Karya Puraskar (AKP) awards. His colleagues like head constables Sukanya and Seema Tyagi are also celebrated cops in this domain.The legal framework under which these officers operate has recently transitioned to the provisions of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, specifically sections addressing kidnapping and trafficking, alongside Juvenile Justice Act and Pocso Act. This legal arsenal allows the AHTU to not only find the missing, but also to dismantle the syndicates that profit from their absence.The unit's investigations are often monitored by high-level bodies like National Human Rights Commission and Delhi Commission for Women, ensuring that a victim-centric approach remains the priority.""This is particularly crucial in habeas corpus petitions assigned by Delhi High Court, where the AHTU is tasked by the judiciary to produce a missing individual who may have been held against their will for years,"" explained an officer. The success rate in such cases is a point of pride for the unit and reflects inter-agency coordination.One of the most effective strategies in the AHTU's toolkit is the implementation of focused campaigns like Operation Muskan and Operation Milap. These month-long drives are designed to saturate the search effort, focusing specifically on children lodged in CCIs who may have been unable to communicate their origins. During these operations, officers become detectives of identity, using old photographs, half-remembered names of villages, or even distinct scars to link ""unclaimed"" children with ""missing"" reports.The vulnerability of children aged under 14 is given special emphasis, as they are the most at risk of being absorbed into labour or trafficking rings. The effectiveness of these drives was vividly demonstrated in Dec 2025, when a special drive ordered by special CP (crime) Devesh Srivastava led to the tracing of a staggering 795 missing persons and children in a single month.""The AHTU's work also extends to prevention, with awareness campaigns in slums and schools, sensitising RWAs to the safety measures that can prevent a child from being snatched in the first place. Between 2020 and July 2025, the unit successfully traced over 1,100 minor children,"" said a DCP-rank officer.A significant portion of these were adolescent girls, a demographic that faces a unique set of perils. The tracing of these persons often requires the AHTU to navigate complex social realities, including the monitoring of placement agencies that provide domestic helps, which can sometimes serve as fronts for exploitation.To maintain the highest standards of operation, in early 2025, the AHTU sought and achieved IS/ISO 9001:2015 certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards. ""This certification is more than a badge of honour; it is a validation of the unit's transparency and quality-driven framework, making it a rare example of a police unit that operates with the administrative precision of a high-end corporation,"" said special CP Srivastava.Ultimately, the story of the AHTU is not found in the ISO certificates or the technical portals, but in the moments of reunion that happen in the quiet corners of the Rohini office. It is found in the look on a mother's face when she sees a child she thought was lost forever, and in the satisfaction of an officer like Sukanya or Gopal Krishan as they close a file that has been open for years, ensuring that in the vast, chaotic landscape of the national capital, no one stays missing forever.","The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) is a specialised unit under Delhi Police crime branch.

NEW DELHI: A critical jaw reconstruction surgery at AIIMS, Delhi has been stalled for over two months due to an administrative deadlock under Ayushman Bharat scheme, leaving a Haryana govt beneficiary in severe pain and unable to eat solid food.Dolly Mandal, a resident of Faridabad, suffered from ameloblastoma of the right mandible, a rare but locally aggressive jaw tumour that destroys bone and can lead to infection and facial deformity if not treated in time.Doctors at AIIMS advised an extended total temporomandibular joint replacement (one unit, right side) to remove the diseased portion of her jaw and reconstruct it. The procedure, estimated to cost Rs 2.5 lakh, including implants, was flagged as medically urgent, with doctors warning that delay could lead to rapid deterioration.""The patient is undergoing treatment in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Pre-authorisation was initiated on Dec 6, 2025, and the case taken up with the state health agency, Haryana, through email and telephonic follow-up. Approval, however, is pending with the state and is subject to clearance by the standing medical committee,"" said Dr V K Bansal, department of surgery, AIIMS.The authority to approve the procedure rests with state govt and is outside the ambit of AIIMS and National Health Authority, Bansal said.Alternative financial assistance may be explored only if the patient holds a BPL ration card, including relief under Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi/Health Minister's Discretionary Grant or the chief minister's fund, he added.During the prolonged wait, Mandal's condition has worsened. Pus began discharging from the tumour, forcing her to survive on a liquid-only diet. The delay has also crippled the family financially, with the patient unable to work and her husband, a daily-wage labourer, staying back in Delhi to care for her and pursue the approvals.The pre-authorisation procedure was filed under an unspecified surgical package, as extended temporomandibular joint replacement is not listed under Health Benefit Package 2022, requiring special clearance from the state health authority. However, the process stalled amid administrative gaps at the state level.The case has drawn sharp legal criticism. ""Why should a patient suffer because of paperwork? Administrative procedures cannot be a reason for delaying treatment. The high court already made it clear that medical care should not be delayed in any circumstance,"" said advocate Ashok Agarwal.Internal correspondence from AIIMS acknowledged the grievance but underscored the hospital's inability to proceed without state approval.Repeated calls and messages to Sumita Misra, Haryana health secretary, for her response on the issue went unanswered.As Mandal waits in pain despite being insured under a govt health scheme, her case exposes a deeper fault line in the system: When treatment hinges on files and committees, who answers for a patient left behind?","Dolly Mandal, a resident of Faridabad, suffered from ameloblastoma of the right mandible, a rare but locally aggressive jaw tumour.
