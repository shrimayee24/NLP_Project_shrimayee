SCO had in June too condemned Israel's military strikes on Iran in a joint statement, but India had then refused to associate itself from it saying the Indian govt wasn't a part of the discussions that preceded the condemnation.The Tianjin Declaration said such aggressive actions against civilian targets, including nuclear energy infrastructure, which resulted in the death of civilians, are a gross violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter, and an infringement of Iran's sovereignty.""They undermine regional and international security and have serious implications for global peace and stability,"" it said. The Declaration also noted that the physical nuclear safety and security of nuclear facilities must be ensured on a permanent basis, including during periods of armed conflict, in order to protect the population and the environment from harm.Reiterating their ""deep concern"" over the continuing escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the member states also strongly condemned the actions that have led to numerous casualties among the civilian population and a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.""They stress the need to ensure an immediate, complete and sustainable ceasefire, access to humanitarian aid, and intensified efforts to achieve peace, stability and security for all residents of the region,"" it said.India had in June also abstained from voting on a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

The warmth in India-Russia ties, despite mounting American pressure on India to discontinue its oil purchase from Russia, was on full display in China, as President Vladimir Putin and PM Narendra Modi walked hand in hand at the SCO summit and later travelled together in Putin’s luxury sedan, Aurus Senat, to the venue for their bilateral meeting.In their talks, Modi strongly backed ties with Russia saying the 2 countries have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in difficult circumstances and close cooperation between them is important for global peace, stability and prosperity. Putin said that the bilateral tes, which are friendly and based on trust,will continue to grow.The PM spent more time with Putin in Tianjin than with any other leader. This included thecarpool ride, another 45 minutes in the car even after reaching the meeting venue and an hour-long bilateral meeting. According to official sources, Putin wanted to travel together with Modi from the SCO summit venue to the hotel where the meeting was to take place, and even waited for about 10 minutes for the PM to join him. The leaders, who were also spotted in a huddle with President Xi Jinping at the SCO venue earlier, were said to havediscussed various issues in the car, while the Russian and Indian delegations waited inside the hotel.In the bilateral meeting, Modi did not specifically call for an immediate ceasefire but told Putin in his opening remarks that the “aspiration of entire humanity” was for all parties to work constructively and end the conflict.“We hope that all parties shall proceed ahead constructively. A way must be found to end this conflict and establish lasting peace,” recalling his past conversation with Putin on the issue and welcoming all recent efforts for establishing peace.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called Modi ahead of the meeting to emphasise the need for an immediate ceasefire without which, he said, it was going to be difficult to have peace talks. He had said later Modi was ready to give “appropriate signal” to Putin.According to an Indian readout, the leaders discussed bilateral cooperation, including in the economic, financial, and energy sectors and expressed satisfaction with the sustained growth in bilateral ties in these areas.On Ukraine, it said, Modi reiterated his support for the recent initiatives that have been taken to address the conflict in Ukraine and emphasized the need to expedite a cessation of the conflict, and to find a durable peace settlement.“The two leaders reaffirmed their support for further strengthening of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries,” said the Indian government, adding that the PM was looking forward to hosting him for the 23rd annual summit later this year. The summit will take place in December.Modi told Putin 140 crore Indians were eagerly waiting to welcome him for the summit. “This is a reflection of the depth and scope of our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. India and Russia have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in the most difficult situations,” said Modi.In his own remarks, Putin said that the multifaceted Russia–India ties will continue to actively develop and trade and economic ties are seeing “positive momentum”.“Russia and India have maintained special relations for decades – friendly and based on trust. This is the foundation for the development of our relations in the future, and these relations are absolutely non-partisan in nature, supported by the overwhelming majority of the peoples of our two countries,” said Putin, adding the 2 countries will closely coordinate efforts on global forums like the UN, BRICS, G20 and SCO.This was the first meeting between Modi and Putin after the Trump administration an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its procurement of crude from Russia. Top US officials have repeatedly targeted India in the past few weeks, accusing the Indian government of bankrolling Russia’s war machine and even calling it Modi’s war. Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Monday India was being punished for buying Russian oil.","The PM spent more time with Putin in Tianjin than with any other leader.

Rising water levels in the Yamuna have also prompted the closure of the Old Railway Bridge from Tuesday evening. In some areas, waterlogging reached two to three feet, leaving vehicles stranded and traffic crawling for hours, including a four-kilometre jam from Hero Honda Chowk to Narsinghpur on NH-48.A leakage was reported at a Gurugram flyover after heavy rainfall, with visuals showing the Signature Tower Chowk underpass covered in water.The Delhi government issued a flood alert after 29,313 cusecs of water was released from Hathnikund Barrage on Monday morning.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha Ram Kalbelia, 55, from Rajasthan's Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

The SCO Tianjin Declaration strongly condemned the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice. Without naming Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi in his address warned member-states against double standards on terrorism and questioned if the open support for terrorism by certain countries can ever be acceptable to the member-states.While the strong condemnation of Pahalgam allowed India to endorse the declaration, the SCO in the same breath, and as a compromise sought by Pakistan, condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express in March and another attack in Khuzdar in May this year.Pakistan has accused India of having a role in the Jaffar Express attack. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier refused to sign on to a joint statement by SCO that didn’t mention the Pahalgam attack on civilians in J&K.“We have to say clearly, and in one voice, that no double standards on terrorism will be acceptable. We have to oppose terrorism together, in every colour and form. This is our responsibility towards humanity,” said Modi in his remarks at the summit.The PM said that SCO stood for 3 pillars - Security, Connectivity and Opportunity. In his remarks, Modi mentioned the Pahalgam attack, calling it an assault not just on the conscience of India but also an open challenge to every country and every individual who believes in humanity.“For the past 4 decades, India has been bearing the grave scars of ruthless terrorism. Countless mothers have lost their children, and innumerable children have been left orphaned. Recently, we witnessed the most heinous face of terrorism in Pahalgam,” said the PM, thanking all nations that stood by India.Modi also said that Terrorism was not only a threat to the security of individual nations, but a shared challenge to all of humanity. “No country, no society, no citizen can consider themselves completely safe from it. That is why India has consistently stressed the importance of unity in the fight against terrorism,” he said, recalling India’s initiative under the SCO counterterrorism mechanism to counter Al-Qaeda and its affiliated terrorist organizations. He backed joint measures against radicalization, extremism and separatism and thanked SCO for supporting India’s position on terror-financing.The Declaration strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, stressed that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable, and called on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists.On connectivity, India again was the only SCO State to not back China’s BRI because its flagship project, China Pakistan Economic Corridor, passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir. The PM said in his remarks “connectivity that bypasses sovereignty ultimately loses both trust and meaning”.Modi underlined that efforts towards connectivity must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, saying this is also enshrined in the core principles of the SCO Charter. He also urged SCO to increase mutual cooperation for reforms of global institutions and call unanimously for UN reform.“To confine the aspirations of the Global South to outdated frameworks is to deny justice to future generations. The colourful dreams of the new generation cannot be displayed on a black-and-white screen. It is time to change the screen,” he said.The PM also underscored that India has been an active member of SCO, which many see as an important platform for India to stress its strategic autonomy, and has always contributed in a constructive and positive manner.While underlining the significance of sovereignty, Modi backed strong connectivity saying it does not merely facilitate trade but also opens the doors to trust and development. “It is with this vision that we are working on initiatives such as the Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor. Through these, we can enhance our linkages with Afghanistan and Central Asia,” said the PM.On opportunity, Modi backed more cooperation and reform recalling that in 2023, under India’s presidency, the SCO witnessed “fresh energy and ideas” along with new areas of cooperation like start-ups and innovation, traditional medicine and digital inclusion. To strengthen people-to-people ties, he proposed creation of a Civilizational Dialogue Forum under the SCO. “Such a platform will allow us to share the richness of our ancient civilizations, art, literature, and traditions on a global stage,” said Modi.",The SCO Tianjin Declaration strongly condemned the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack. Pakistan has accused India of having a role in the Jaffar Express attack. PM Narendra Modi in his address warned member-states against double standards on terrorism.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123643112,imgsize-1071029,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-photo.jpg"
"Why are minority institutions left out of RTE, asks SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-are-minority-institutions-left-out-of-rte-asks-sc/articleshow/123643958.cms,"RTE exemption may undermine vision of universal edu: SC

NEW DELHI: Expressing serious doubts about its own 2014 verdict delivered by a five-judge constitution bench, which held that provisions of Right to Education (RTE) Act were not applicable to religious and linguistic minority educational institutions, Supreme Court has said the ruling ""strikes at the heart of good quality universal elementary education, its consequences are far-reaching"", and hence it needs to be re-examined.While deciding a batch of pleas from Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra on whether passing the Teacher Eligibility Test was mandatory for appointment in minority-run schools, a two-judge bench referred the case to CJI to consider the desirability of forwarding the matter to a larger bench. It said putting minority institutions outside the Act's ambit would weaken the idea of inclusivity.Minority schools aren't bound by the law that sets rules for appointment of teachers and the provision of free education for poor students.The SC bench said its own 2014 judgment essentially created a dichotomy between RTE under Article 21A and the collective rights under Article 30(1), which is about the right of minority communities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.""We respectfully express our doubt as to whether Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (case) (insofar as it exempts the application of the RTE Act to minority schools, whether aided or unaided, falling under clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution) has been correctly decided...Thus,ultimately, a reconsideration (of the judgment) seems unavoidable,"" Justice Dipankar Datta, who penned the verdict for the bench, also comprising Justice Manmohan, said.The bench said, ""We hasten to observe with utmost humility at our command that the decision in Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (case) might have, unknowingly, jeopardised the very foundation of universal elementary education. Exemption of minority institutions from the RTE Act leads to fragmentation of the common schooling vision and weakening of the idea of inclusivity and universality envisioned by Article 21A. """"We are afraid, instead of uniting children across caste, class, creed, and community, it reinforces 'divides' and 'dilutes' the transformative potential of shared learning spaces. If the goal is to build an equal and cohesive society, such exemptions move us in the opposite direction,"" it said.The bench framed four issues to be adjudicated by a larger bench and it included whether the 2014 verdict, exempting minority educational institutions from the purview of the RTE Act, requires reconsideration.The bench noted that exemption of minority schools from the Act was being misused.","Supreme Court expresses serious doubts about its own 2014 verdict delivered by a five-judge constitution bench.

However, in its judgment the bench upheld Telangana’s domicile rule while recording the state’s concessions — children of state govt employees and all India service Telangana cadre officers who studied outside because of posting of their parents outside the state would be eligible for admissions.Writing the judgment recording the relaxations for children of state and all India services employees posted outside Telangana, Justice Chandran said, “We uphold the Rules of 2017 as it stood amended in 2024.”This means that children of natives of Telangana, working in private companies and posted outside the state, would not be eligible to admissions in the 85% of MBBS seats in govt medical colleges of the state.Faulting the HC order scaling down the ‘domicile’ eligibility conditions for admission, SC cited its 2018 judgment upholding a similar domicile eligibility criterion devised by Assam.The court had said there was no data on record to state that adequate coaching facilities for medical entrance examination was unavailable in the state. It had said that those who can afford coaching outside the state fall in the affluent class of citizens and could compete for the 15% all India quota MBBS seats reserved in every state-run medical college.","The Supreme Court said since states have given up 15% of MBBS seats to the all India quota (AIQ), they can validly reserve rest of the seats in govt medical colleges for natives.

A few years ago, Civil Rights Department of Democrat-controlled California sued Cisco Systems at the instance of a PIO employee who alleged that he was denied a leadership position by his upper caste colleagues; chiefly Sundar Iyer, an alumnus of Bombay IIT.Iyer who denied the charge and won a significant victory against Civil Rights Department, lamented about being accused of casteism. ""Civil Rights Department assigned Brahmin caste to me,"" Iyer had famously remarked while rebutting the charges against him.Equality Labs, widely seen as a group of activists who are unlikely to agree with Navarro and Trump's MAGA movement has taken upon itself to document alleged cases of caste-based discrimination in US: something which the Hindu groups have flayed as an attempt to divide Indians and, particularly, Hindus.The influence of ""liberals"" has appeared to be on the wane since Trump's success last Nov, with many Democrats and centrists blaming the success of MAGA on ""woke activism"".

NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Far away from the raging bilateral tariff tensions, India and the US on Monday kicked off one of their largest-ever Army `Yudh Abhyas' exercise in Alaska, even as planning is underway to conduct the top-notch Malabar naval exercise among the `Quad’ countries off Guam in the Western Pacific in Nov.India-US ties may have plummeted after President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi, but defence officials say the bilateral strategic partnership assiduously built over the last two decades, with defence cooperation being its cornerstone, is in no danger of unravelling as yet.“It’s early days yet…though mutual trust has taken a big hit, there is too much at stake,” an official said. Just in terms of defence acquisitions, the delivery of 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for $716 million in Aug 2021 to power the all-important indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, has just about begun after a two-year delay. India is also getting set to sign another deal with GE for 113 more such engines for $1 billion.Apart from other deals, India is also slated to receive 31-armed MQ-9B`Predator’ high-altitude, long endurance drones, ordered from the US for $3.8 billion in Oct last year, in the 2029-30 timeframe.The US has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth over $25 billion since 2007, though there might be a re-think on future arms deals if the downward trajectory in bilateral ties continues amid the ongoing geopolitical churn unleashed by Trump.India, in pursuit of its “strategic autonomy”, of course, has already accelerated its re-engagement with China despite the continuing trust deficit on the border, while steadfastly sticking to its long-standing strategic-defence ties with Russia.Far away in the subarctic climate of Fort Wainwright in Alaska, over 450 Madras Regiment soldiers will undertake a spectrum of high-altitude tactical drills with troops from the 5th Infantry Regiment “Bobcats” of the Arctic Wolves Brigade Combat Team, 11th Airborne Division of the US, till Sept 14.“Over two weeks, the troops will rehearse joint heliborne operations, employment of surveillance resources and unmanned aerial systems, rock-craft, mountain warfare, casualty evacuation, combat medical aid and the integrated use of artillery, aviation and electronic warfare systems,” an Army officer said.Parallelly, India, the US, Australia and Japan are finalising the operational details for the upcoming 29edition of the high-voltage Malabar naval exercise off Guam. The Malabar began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992but includes all “Quad” countries now, with an eye firmly on China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific and their resolve to deter any coercion in the crucial region.India and the US have been steadily cranking up the scope, strength, complexity and frequency of their bilateral exercises, while stepping-up participation in multilateral ones, as part of their “strategic partnership and convergence” over the years.","India-US ties may have plummeted after President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The 15finance commission envisaged 17,000 anganwadis cum creches (AWCCs) by 2025-26. Only 2,448 AWCCs (less than 15%) have been made operational till the end of July with over 52,000 beneficiaries.According to government data, nearly 9 crore children (0-6 years) were enrolled in anganwadis. Barely 0.06% of them have access to creche facilities. The projected population of children up to six years, the target population for creches, was roughly 16 crore in 2021.From 7,930 creches in June 2019, the number of creches has steadily fallen. Opening more creches was meant to boost women’s workforce participation, but answers to queries in Parliament show that the number of functional creches has been reducing. Uttar Pradesh, with high fertility and high child population, had no creches in 2019 and continues to have none. In fact, none have been approved. Many such states with high child population such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Odisha, which used to have several hundred creches, have become zero-creche states.By the end of July, the ministry of women and child development had approved 14,599 anganwadi cum creches (AWCCs) based on the proposals received from states and union territories.However, only a fraction of these have become operational, according to data presented in Parliament. For instance, 1,024 AWCCs have been approved for Jharkhand and 1,000 for Odisha, but none are operational in either state. In Telangana, 1,033 have been approved and only eight are functional with 63 beneficiaries. Rajasthan has no approved or functional AWCCs.Some states have standalone creches run by NGOs and aided by the central government. However, the number of such creches has been falling steadily. From 2,412 across India in 2023, these have come down to just 1,284. According to Niti Aayog, a majority of states have stated that they prefer to run anganwadi cum creches (AWCCs) instead of separate stand-alone crèches as it increases their financial, HR and administrative burden.Following allegations of irregularities in the management of creches and misappropriation of funds, the Rajiv Gandhi National Creche Scheme launched in January 2006 was discontinued by December 31, 2016. Before the scheme was discontinued, it was funding almost 25,000 creches with about 6 lakh beneficiaries, according to data presented to Parliament data in March 2017.From January 1, 2017, the ministry funded creche services through the National Creche Scheme, wherein stand-alone creches were operated as a centrally funded scheme with the Centre bearing 90% of the cost and the remaining 10% borne by voluntary organisations running the creches.However, since state or UT governments were not stakeholders in the scheme, it was felt that monitoring and supervision was inadequate. Hence, the women and child development ministry introduced the Palna scheme on April 1, 2022 “to provide quality crèche facility in safe and secure environment for children (from ages 6 months – 6 years), nutritional support, health and cognitive development of children, growth monitoring & immunization. Crèchefacilities under Palna are provided to all mothers, irrespective of their employment status”. Crèches are supposed to be open for 26 days in a month and for seven and half hours per day as per the work schedule of majority of mothers in the area.The funding ratio under Palna is 60:40 between union and state governments and UTs with legislature, except the North East and special category states, where the ratio is 90:10. For UTs without legislature, 100% funding is provided by the Centre. This funding pattern is probably why states and UTs with 90-100% central funding account for more than a third of operational creches.With the change in funding pattern, by 2019, the number of functional creches crashed to less than 8,000 and kept declining till it reached an all-time low of 2,163 creches (1,428 stand-alone creches and 735 AWCCs) in June 2024. Though this number had gone up to 2,448 creches by July-end this year, seven large states had zero functional creches while two, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, had three and eight each.","The 15finance commission envisaged 17,000 anganwadis cum creches by 2025-26.

Sadhguru Reveals Its Mystical Power

Poll Do you agree with Sadhguru's view on India's ability to thrive despite challenges? Yes, I believe in India's resilience No, challenges are too overwhelming

Sadhguru on Saturday completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, just 18 months after undergoing two emergency brain surgeries.He was welcomed at the Coimbatore Airport, with locals, villagers and volunteers lining the route to the ashram in a devotional procession.Speaking to journalists at Coimbatore Airport, Sadhguru noted, “As per medical advice, I was not supposed to ride a motorcycle, yet I went to 18,000 feet above mean sea level. This demonstrates the power of yoga.”Describing how yoga helped him in the journey, he said, “Yoga means you become one with the very source of creation, which is within every one of us. So when you are in touch with the source of creation, this is not a challenge. Effortlessly, I have done this at this stage.”Sadhguru began his yatra on a motorcycle, from Gorakhpur on August 9, travelling through Nepal and Tibet amid rain, landslides, rough terrain and altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. His route took him through Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Thulikhel in Nepal, before crossing into Tibet via Zhangmu, Nyalam and Saga.After reaching Lake Manasarovar, he trekked to Mount Kailash.Ahead of the journey, in an interaction with actor Dino Morea he had said, “I am not going to see Shiva. For me, the dimension we refer to as Shiva—when I close my eyes, that is where I am. I don’t have to go to Kailash for that. Kailash is the most spectacular library, but these days I am not going even for that.”He further added, “I'm taking a few hundred people with me. People when they wake up in the morning, do they say Shiva? No, they'll say stock market or cinema. So for those people with altitude and variety of other challenges, it lowers their concerns about stock market and we can get them to focus on something more profound.”Talking about the tariffs that the US has imposed on India, he said, “When challenges are thrown at us, it's for us to stand up sharper and stronger, which I think India will do for sure. Maintaining India's sovereignty, its freedom to do its business the way it wants to do, is something that we cannot give up as a free nation.”“Even when things are against you, you must thrive. That is the capacity we need to build. And this is a good example, this is a good lesson for us. To make sure that India thrives no matter what kind of conditions,” he furher added.","Sadhguru completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore.

Why Nestlé sacked its CEO



Who is Philipp Navratil, the new Nestlé CEO?









Swiss food giant Nestlé on Monday sacked its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation found he had an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate”, in breach of the company’s code of business conduct.Freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to CEO in September 2024 after leading its Latin America division.Freixe’s exit places him among a growing list of high-profile business leaders forced out over workplace relationships. As per AFP, similar departures include BP’s Bernard Looney in 2023 and McDonald’s Steve Easterbrook in 2019, who were both removed for failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.The company announced that Nespresso chief Philipp Navratil will take over the role.According to news agency AFP, Nestlé’s board launched an inquiry overseen by chairman Paul Bulcke and lead independent director Pablo Isla, supported by external counsel.“The departure of Laurent Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate which breached Nestlé's code of business conduct,” the board said in a statement.Bulcke called the decision “necessary”, adding, “Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.”As per The Guardian, Freixe replaced Mark Schneider last year in a surprise switch, tasked with reviving sluggish consumer demand. Nestlé has faced challenges, including falling profits and weak spending in China, while also passing on higher raw material costs to shoppers.The company’s shares dropped nearly a quarter in 2024 but closed slightly higher on Monday at 75.49 Swiss francs.Navratil, who began his career with Nestlé in 2001, rose through senior roles in Central America and Mexico before leading the Nescafé and Starbucks brands globally. He became Nespresso CEO in 2024 and joined the executive board in January 2025.According to Axios, the board praised him for “achieving results in challenging environments” and said he would “accelerate efficiency efforts” without altering Nestlé’s current strategy.","Laurent Freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to CEO in September 2024 after leading its Latin America division.

Bengaluru’s persistent and infamous traffic woes seem to have forced Infosys , India’s second largest IT services firm, to reschedule its bus service timings for employees. Infosys has modified the evening bus departure times from its Electronic City facility in Bengaluru, having discovered that employees' extensive travel times were disrupting their interactions with US clients, including calls and presentations. The revised schedule was implemented on September 1.The ongoing construction projects and deteriorating road conditions in Bengaluru have severely impacted traffic movement, causing significant delays.Despite the BMRCL launching the 19-km Yellow Line Metro from RV Road to Bommasandra with 16 stations on August 10, the service has not significantly reduced road congestion. The stations include Konappana Agrahara and Hebbagodi, which received funding from Infosys and Biocon, respectively.According to an internal communication quoted in an ET report, the adjustments were attributed to evening rush hour ""congestion"" on Bengaluru's roads. Infosys has adjusted its bus services to depart at 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM, replacing the previous timings of 5:30 PM and 6:30 PM.The communication indicated that the company recognised employees were experiencing delayed arrivals at home due to traffic issues. Infosys said it would monitor the impact of these changes and remained receptive to additional adjustments if required.""It used to take about 90 minutes or more for those of us boarding the 5.30 pm bus to reach home. This came in the way of handling official calls and hurt productivity,"" an employee told ET, not willing to be identified.The timing modifications were implemented after many Infosys staff members, who interact with clients during evening hours in alignment with US time zones, expressed their concerns to their supervisors.Staff members continue their work duties from home, both online and offline, after leaving the office. ""We handle official calls, which we cannot do during the commute due to client confidentiality. We gave this feedback to our managers.""To reduce traffic on city roads and within its campus, Infosys provides its own bus service for employees, particularly beneficial for those residing in areas without metro connectivity. Staff members find these bus services practical as the pickup points are situated near their residences.The company's workforce of approximately 323,500 employees follows a five-day week schedule, working 9.15 hours daily. Under the return-to-office directive implemented on November 20, 2023, staff must work on-site for a minimum of 10 days monthly.","Infosys has modified the evening bus departure times from its Electronic City facility in Bengaluru.

GURGAON: Gurgaon witnessed severe traffic chaos on Monday as waterlogged roads and vehicle breakdowns left commuters stranded across the city.The traffic police helpline received around 200 distress calls till 7.30 pm, with residents seeking help to move stalled vehicles, report breakdowns, and find less congested routes.Major traffic congestion was reported on the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway (NH-48) near Rajiv Chowk, where a water pump was deployed to drain the flooded road.Also read: 'Gurgaon has collapsed': Hours-long jams force commuters to book hotels; rains trigger citywide chaos Traffic was also significantly affected at Narsinghpur, Hero Honda Chowk, IFFCO Chowk, and near Kherki Daula toll plaza.A video going viral on social media platform X shows the NH-48 jammed with vehicles following heavy rainfall.The footage captures the night-time gridlock, with an unbroken line of cars stuck in traffic, their red and white headlights stretching far into the distance.The downpour submerged several areas under two to three feet of water and triggered a 4km traffic jam from Hero Honda CHowk to Narsingpur.Other bottlenecks included Khushal Chowk, Mahavir Chowk bus stand (where an underpass was inundated), Gurgaon Railway Station Road, Sheetla Mata Temple Road, Airforce Station, Agrasen Chowk, Bhondsi Road, Vatika Chowk, Tulip Chowk, Malibu Town, Bilaspur, Signature Tower, CRP Chowk, Subash Chowk, Golf Course Road, and near Galleria Market in DLF Phase-4.Over 25 vehicles broke down till evening, further worsening traffic conditions.A bus near Jharsa on the Jaipur-Delhi Expressway added to commuters’ woes, while bikes and cars were removed by traffic police with the help of cranes and manual assistance.Commuters expressed frustration at the prolonged delays. Sunidhi Sharma, stuck on NH-48, said, “Usually it takes me around 20 minutes to reach Shankar Chowk from Atlas Chowk, but today it took me around 90 minutes. The roads are broken, there are multiple bottlenecks, and authorities work only on paper. Nothing changes.”Similarly, IT professional Niharika Singh said, “What usually takes 20 minutes from my office in Cyber City to home in Sector 14 took one-and-a-half hours today. The entire expressway was packed, and traffic was crawling.”DCP Traffic Rajesh Mohan said authorities deployed traffic personnel at over 100 waterlogging points, with 23 critical points managed closely. “Traffic police coordinated with relevant departments to drain water from flooded areas and ensure smooth movement. Vehicles stuck or broken down on the road were moved to safe locations using cranes and manual assistance,” he added.The city’s traffic woes underscore the recurring challenges Gurgaon faces during even brief spells of rain, exposing weaknesses in infrastructure and road maintenance despite repeated warnings from residents and commuters.","Gurgaon witnessed severe traffic chaos on Monday as waterlogged roads and vehicle breakdowns left commuters stranded across the city.

Yamuna Water Level: Delhi braces for floods as Yamuna nears danger mark; CM Rekha Gupta says evacuation underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-braces-for-floods-as-yamuna-nears-danger-mark-cm-rekha-gupta-says-evacuation-underway/articleshow/123645054.cms,"Delhi Rain Chaos: Waterlogged Streets, Massive Traffic Jams Hit City After Sudden Change in Weather

Delhi is well prepared and situation is being monitored, says CM Rekha





NEW DELHI: Delhi is bracing for possible floods with Yamuna expected to cross the danger mark of 205.33m early Tuesday. A statement from Delhi CM's office said the water level could rise beyond 207m, a situation that calls for immediate evacuation from low-lying areas.The old railway bridge has been closed for operations, and the evacuation process under supervision of district magistrates has been initiated in several areas, with people living under the old railway bridge, parts of Mayur Vihar and Yamuna Bazar, among others, being moved. Officials said camps were being set up and food-related arrangements being made.The rise in water level follows release of over three lakh cusecs from Haryana's Hathnikund barrage between 8am and 5pm Monday after heavy rainfall in the mountains. The discharge at Hathnikund barrage, which is normally less than 50,000 cusecs, was 1.65 lakh cusecs at 4am and 2.10L cusecs at 5pm on Sunday, rising to 3.11L cusecs by 8am on Monday and further to 3.23L cusecs by 12pm.The water released from Hathnikund normally impacts the city in 36 to 48 hours.Officials from the Delhi govt said that two regulators - which control the flow of major drains - were shut at Vijay Ghat and Tonga Stand in the central Delhi area to avoid backflow of the Yamuna into houses through drains.Officials said that to keep the major city channels clear, stormwater will be pumped out into the Yamuna.During the floods of 2023, river water back-flowing through drains and sewage into people's homes was a major problem.The Irrigation and Flood Control Department has issued a flood warning, directing district magistrates, police, and other agencies to take precautionary steps, including evacuating residents of low-lying areas and those living along the riverbanks.According to the forecast, the Yamuna could touch 206m between 5pm and 8pm on Tuesday.""As the water level of ORB may cross the danger level and is likely to exceed 206.50m (CWC advisory may be expected soon). So, all sector officers are hereby advised to keep a strict vigil in their respective areas and to take necessary action at vulnerable points, such as people residing within river embankments shall be warned and shifted to safer places. Police and I&FC department staff would undertake patrolling along the right and left marginal embankments and keep vigil round-the-clock on the vulnerable points, regulators/pumps etc as required,"" stated a report from the I&FC department.CM Rekha Gupta said the govt and the departments concerned were prepared for all actions and the situation was being monitored and necessary measures taken.""All barrage gates have been opened to ensure smooth flow, preventing any stagnation. The water is flowing out as swiftly as it enters,"" said Delhi irrigation minister Pravesh Sahib Singh.He also urged people not to panic and assured them that there was no risk of flooding in outer areas. Gupta said the floodplains are part of the river's ecosystem and urged people living in such areas or in the vicinity of the river to exercise caution and strictly follow instructions issued by the administration.The CM said that given the volume of water released from the Hathnikund Barrage, it is estimated that the water level may rise to 207 metres or slightly higher.",Delhi is bracing for possible floods with Yamuna expected to cross the danger mark of 205.33m early Tuesday.

An industry that laid the foundation for Goa’s largest slum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/an-industry-that-laid-the-foundation-for-goas-largest-slum/articleshow/123621831.cms,"The slum has not stopped growing, with residents constructing new units every year to be rented out to new migrant workers

Zuarinagar, once a barren plateau, has undergone a dramatic transformation into a densely populated slum. What was originally temporary shelters for workers have now turned into houses for 17,000-18,000 people from various states

Though the Sancoale panchayat has started waste collection, the residents have opposed and refuse to pay garbage tax





Around the early 1970s, the Zuari Agrochemical unit by the industrialist family, Birla, became operational in Goa atop the plateau now known as Zuarinagar. Industrial activity spurred the need for labour, and the early settlement on the then-desolate plateau has over the years grown into a sprawling slum.An estimated population of 17,000 to 18,000 resides primarily in matchbox-type, haphazard constructions on approximately 80,000 sqm of mostly comunidade land, as well as 30,000 sqm of private plots.“The slum hasn’t stopped growing. Only 500 to 600 of the houses there are of the original labourers who came there, mostly from Karnataka. Today there are settlers from Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and all other parts of India. When Zuari industries brought labour to Goa, they failed to provide them with decent accommodation. They had only created housing for their officials. The labourers gradually began occupying comunidade land,” said Ramakant Borkar, former long-time sarpanch of the Sancoale panchayat, under whose jurisdiction the slum falls.Slow action from comunidade and panchayat officials initially helped the slum expand.There was no looking back once the settlers received voting rights.“They have voting rights in Goa as well as Karnataka. Politicians send buses for the slum dwellers during the Karnataka elections. Even H D Deve Gowda has campaigned here for Karnataka polls. People are still constructing houses in the slum. Most are 50 sqm units with three floors. Many rent these houses fueling the migration,” said Borkar.It is a well-known fact that during the construction of the NH 17-B, a large part of the slum area was to be acquired, but the highway alignment was changed to save the slum based on pleas of its dwellers.A plan to rehabilitate the residents under Alina Saldanha as the MLA also did not materialise due to alleged pressure from the Zuarinagar slum residents.Only recently, local MLA and minister Mauvin Godinho pushed for empowered house numbers (EHN) for the structures and residents began paying house tax. But despite collection in force by the panchayat, the garbage tax plan was opposed by residents.Today, the large dumps of garbage and open defecation point to poor living conditions.“Barely 20% of the houses are legal. When EHN was introduced, 40% did not take it, because they feared it would prove their houses were illegal until then. Not every house can have an attached toilet due to the small size. Around 20% still defecate in the open. There are 20 common toilets constructed by govt for a population of 17,000 to 18,000,” said a local.The need for labour for loading and unloading vegetables and fish and other work in Vasco has ensured the slum grows at a steady pace, said resident Kariya Yadav.“How can we be uprooted from here in the name of rehabilitation? My father had come here as a worker. Me and my brothers were born and brought up here. Our entire families grew up here. There are three schools, Balrath facilities, road, power and water supply. Everything we need is here,” said Yadav.Borkar said that despite a high court order to vacate slums from the 30,000 sqm of private land, it has not been enforced after resident women threatened the demolition squad with self-immolation.“In case of the comunidade land, the comunidade only issues notices over the years. Panchayat and comunidade push the blame on one another. By the time it is time for action, the comunidade committee or panchayat changes hands and the same circle continues,” said Borkar.","Zuarinagar, once a barren plateau, has undergone a dramatic transformation into a densely populated slum.

Yes, absolutely No, current regulations are sufficient





GHAZIABAD: Around 30 vehicle owners have submitted a police complaint after their cars broke down allegedly within hours of refuelling at a fuel station in Morta between Aug 26 and 29.On Saturday, angry customers gathered at a Bajaj HP filling station near pillar number 609 after their cars, some of them high-end models such as Kia Sonet, Kia Seltos, Scorpio, Innova, and Fortuner, developed engine snags.They accused the outlet of selling adulterated diesel and claimed the alleged impurities in diesel may cost dozens of car owners heavily, with estimates suggesting repair bills of up to Rs 3.5 lakh per vehicle.Sachin Tyagi, whose Kia Sonet broke down, said the problem surfaced immediately after refuelling. ""I had filled my tank on Aug 26 and drove towards Raj Nagar Extension, but the car would not cross 40 kmph. The next day, it refused to start. At the showroom, I was told impurities in diesel had choked the fuel system and repairs would cost me Rs 3.5 lakh,"" he said, adding the 45 litres of diesel had cost him Rs 3,951, with the current price at Rs 87.8 per litre.Another motorist, Mohit Tyagi, faced similar trouble with his Kia Seltos. ""My driver was headed to Haldwani after refuelling the car at the Morta pump, but the car broke down midway. It has to be towed back now,"" he said.For Shuvam Tyagi, the setback was doubled. ""Both my Scorpio SUVs are lying at the showroom. One broke down the morning after refuelling, so I used my second vehicle. After refuelling, it also suffered the same fate,"" he said.By Thursday, at least 29 affected car owners had come together to stage a protest. ""All of us had refuelled at the same station between Aug 26 and 29. The manager refused to accept responsibility, so we called the police. We will also move the consumer forum,"" one of the protesters said.Residents said hundreds of cars and trucks had refuelled at the station during the period, raising fears that the scale of damage may be wider than currently reported.Mechanics at authorised service centres confirmed that impurities in the fuel had damaged engines. A Mahindra showroom mechanic told TOI, ""The fuel filters were completely clogged and injectors ruined. Depending on the model, repairs could range between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 3.5 lakh.""Abhishek, the manager of the Bajaj HP station, acknowledged receiving complaints but stopped short of admitting fault. ""We have sent diesel samples for testing. Until the results are in, I cannot comment,"" he said.Automobile experts said contaminated diesel can severely damage filters and injectors, often leading to expensive replacements. Even small debris in the fuel can choke injectors and harm pumps. And in such cases, timely replacement of filters is critical, they said.",Angry customers gathered at a Bajaj HP filling station near pillar number 609 after their cars developed engine snags.

New Delhi: Rain triggered traffic congestion in several parts of the city, with many motorists halting midway and resuming only after the downpour eased. Travellers posted their woes on social media and share updates on the state of roads from numerous multiple locations.""Every time it pours in Delhi-NCR, the driving rules somehow become optional… the number of vehicles going the wrong way increases, traffic lights stop functioning, and even when some work, no one follows them,"" a motorist posted on X. Another wrote, ""Libaspur underpass has been jammed for the last half an hour, and no traffic personnel are present at the spot.""There were reports of congestion near Qutub Minar, Kashmere Gate, Mehrauli and many more spots. During the home commute in the evening, the rain caused lengthy, intractable jams on the roads. As one car owner heading towards Saket groaned, ""If anyone is trying to get to Max Hospital this evening, I pray for you. The road leading to the hospital is horribly jammed in this pouring rain. An ambulance was struggling to get through for over 30 minutes on a short stretch. Delhi is a mess in the monsoon.""Reacting to this situation, another user on X poured out his grievances: ""The entire Press Enclave traffic flow and multiple intersections need a revamp and strict monitoring.""The road going to Kalindi Kunj via the Sarita Vihar underpass and the main road facing Jasola faced a similar situation. Due to waterlogging and damage to the underpass, traffic invariably comes to a halt when it rains. A tweet appealed, ""Traffic on Kalindi Kunj bridge… due to heavy rainfall it is getting very hectic, kindly help. ""In other parts of the city, the exasperations were no less. ""Heavy traffic reported in Hari Nagar market (near Sandoz). There were police staff present close to the spot but no help extended by them. It was after I and a couple of other Samaritans (intervened) that things improved,"" said a self-congratulatory user.Ironically, sources said there were no major calls on waterlogging on the PWD helpline. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi also didn't report any waterlogging in areas under its jurisdiction.","Rain triggered traffic congestion in several parts of the city.

Future uncertain





BENGALURU: Bike-taxi riders in the city are reporting higher daily incomes after resumption of services, thanks to a commission-free model and a modest fare hike. Aggregators are temporarily not deducting their usual cut from rides, leaving the entire fare with drivers, while commuters have seen an increase of around 20% in trip costs.Since bike taxis resumed operations in the city on Aug 21, fares per kilometre have seen a slight increase. However, the high demand and lack of cheaper alternatives have led commuters to prefer two-wheelers to autorickshaws, which typically charge higher rates.Within two days of the resumption, aggregators Uber and Ola suspended their bike-taxi services following a clarification from the Karnataka high court. The court stated that it did not issue any order permitting the resumption of services, although it did not prohibit individual riders from operating independently. Bike-taxi riders with Rapido continue to operate under the Bike Direct initiative that has waived of the commission.Nithin, a bike-taxi rider, said: ""Whatever money is made, it comes directly now, they are not taking any cut. Earlier, if I rode 12-13 hours a day, commissions alone would add up to Rs 250.Now I can keep that money for myself.""Another driver, Manoj, said the model had been a lifeline after 2.5 months of lost income: ""If we go 10km, we get Rs 100-105. Now the entire amount is ours. Normally, Rs 10 used to get deducted per order. This way, survival is easier.""Karimullah, who earns close to Rs 1,500 daily, said he had left his auto to take up bike taxis. ""Even during the ban, I didn't want to go back to autos because I knew this would be financially better. Now I'm making a few hundred rupees more than before.""For commuters, fares have gone up slightly, with many reporting increase of Rs 10-20 per trip. Yet, the convenience of bike taxis keeps them popular. Rama Lalitha, who travels daily from Doddanekundi to Bagamane Tech Park, said: ""It used to be Rs 40, now it fluctuates between Rs 50 and 60. But it's still cheaper than paying Rs 100-120 for an auto. And it's quicker, no need to haggle or pay tips.""The favourable earnings are being seen as temporary by rider groups. Adi Narayana, president of the Bike Taxi Welfare Association, said: ""As of now, captains are getting the full amount, which is good. But I'm not sure it will remain the same once new policies are framed.""While the zero-commission model and fare hikes have created a short-term earnings surge, both riders and commuters are waiting to see if regulatory clarity will change the equation again.","Aggregators are temporarily not deducting their usual cut from rides, leaving the entire fare with drivers.

Ellison added that he completely impressed with his unwavering stamina and ambition. He also went ahead and linked Gates with industrial titan John D. Rockefeller , saying, “If he were Edison, he’d be less dangerous. He is utterly relentless… he wants it all.”The remarks by Oracle founder underscores Bill Gates reputation as a powerhouse.

By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Kairan Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers. ""I had a very broad scope and a lot of responsibility, especially for a junior engineer,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider.The Bangladeshi-American teenager will live within walking distance of Citadel Securities' Manhattan office, eliminating his previous need for his mother to drive him to work in Washington state. His mother's background as an investment banker provided early exposure to finance, making the transition feel natural despite his engineering roots, the report said.","Kairan Quazi, 16, is leaving SpaceX to join Citadel Securities as a quantitative developer.

Nvidia on 15% US government ‘cut’

Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. This marked a 6% increase from the previous quarter and a 56% jump year-over-year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance following the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the US tech companies can’t be left out of the Chinese market adding that they need to serve as a worldwide standard similar to the US dollar. Jensen Huang said “[President Trump] understands that the American tech stack should be the world standard. Just as the American dollar is the world standard that economies are built on, we want the American tech stack for the world’s technology and industries to be built on, and that includes China.”Speaking about the restoration of sales to China, the CEO of the world's most valuable company said that Nvidia is getting the engine “fired back up” and already has licenses from the US government. “We’ve been approved and licensed to be able to ship to China, and now we’re looking for orders in China,” Jensen Huang added.Explaining further, Huang said “We have every opportunity to succeed in the China market, if they would allow for American technology companies to be able to play there. And so I’m hoping things will get sorted out”.During the interview, Huang also touched upon the opportunity in the networking space. “Just our ethernet product line grew to an annualized rate of $10 billion, and that’s just gotten started. Networking is going to be a very big part of our business. That’s fundamentally recognizing the fusion of computing, networking, and software,” Huang said.During the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company is still waiting for the Trump administration to finalize an agreement under which Nvidia will pay the US government a 15% share of its sales in China.CEO Jensen Huang added that while Nvidia is in talks with the administration on China, it is not considering the kind of deal Intel made with Washington. “Nor has that come up in discussions,” Huang said.In a Fox Business Network interview, Huang said: ""I don't know that it's 'forced to say yes,' but ultimately, it's in the best interest of the world, of our country, for us to be able to sell in China"" .""So whatever it takes to get it approved for us to be able to sell in China is fine with us,"" he added.",N Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026.

Elon Musk has filed a motion to dismiss the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit. The lawsuit filed by SEC accuses Musk of failing to properly disclose his stake in Twitter (now known as X) during his 2022 acquisition campaign. As reported by Reuters, the SpaceX CEO argues that the SEC’s case is politically motivated and legally flawed. Filed in 2023, the lawsuit alleges that Elon Musk violated federal securities law. He did not timely report his purchase of than 5% of Twitter’s shares. The report adds that Musk waited for 21 days, which allowed him to continue buying shares at lower prices before the market could react.According to Reuters report, in a motion filed in the federal court, Elon Musk’s attorney argued that the SCE’s interpretation of disclosure rule is very much rigged and it also ignores the context of his actions. The lawyers claim that Musk intention was never to mislead invests and the also did not materially harm the market.""The SEC does not allege that Mr. Musk acted intentionally, deliberately, wilfully, or even recklessly...

Sullivan on Trump’s India-Pakistan remarks



Trump & Pakistan business







NEW DELHI: Former US National Security Advisor (NSA) and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India to further his family’s business interests in Pakistan In an interview with MeidasTouch YouTube channel, Sullivan described the development as “a huge strategic harm” to the United States itself.He was asked about America’s trade row with India and Trump’s repeated claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, which resurfaced after the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir.“I think this is one of the more under-reported stories in Trump's foreign policy, and I'm really glad that you raised it,” Sullivan said in response to the host’s question, which also mentioned the Trump family’s Bitcoin business with Pakistan and Tim Cook’s Apple factories in India.The former NSA stressed that the US has for decades worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen ties with India, “the world's largest democracy,” and a country it should be “aligned with on technology, talent, economics, and so many other issues, and aligned with in dealing with the strategic threat from China.”Sullivan noted that Washington had made significant progress in developing these ties. “And now, in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, he has thrown the India relationship over the side.That is a huge strategic harm in its own right because a strong US-India relationship serves our interests,” he added.He warned that such moves would worry US allies worldwide. “But imagine every other country in the world, your Germany, your Japan, your Canada. You look at that and you say that could be us tomorrow. And that only reinforces your view that you got to hedge against the United States,” Sullivan said.According to him, America’s credibility was at stake. “And having all of our friends and countries around the world decide they just can't rely on the US in any way, shape or form. That is not in the interest of the American people long term. Our word should be our bond. We should be good for what we say. Our friends should be able to rely on us. And that has always been our strength. And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”During the conversation, Sullivan was reminded of Trump’s earlier claims about being “best friends with Modi” and promising that the first deal he would sign would be with India. The host said Trump then began “taking credit for resolving the India Pakistan war which is a very big sensitive topic for India saying you did not do that stop taking he does that every day and that like you know hurts their hurts everything there and it like crushes them that's not they go that's not true. ”The host further alleged, “Donald Trump took like his family took Bitcoin from the Pakistani Bitcoin sovereign fund and they brought in the general from the Pakistan to be there and India's like what the hell are you. And then meanwhile, you still have Apple building new factories because Tim Cook came in with the gold bar and he's building the factories in India. What do you make of what's happening there?”Sullivan reiterated, “I think this is one of the more under reported stories in Trump's foreign policy and I'm really glad that you raised it on a bipartisan basis going back decades. The United States has worked to build its relationship with India, the world's largest democracy, a country that we should be aligned with on technology and talent and economics and so many other issues and aligned with in dealing with this strategic threat from China. And we had come a long way on that. And now in no small part, I think because of Pakistan's willingness to do business deals with the Trump family, Trump has thrown the India relationship over the side.

And what's happening with India right now has huge direct impacts. But it also has this reverberating impact across all of our relationships and partnerships in the world.”Before concluding, Sullivan remarked, “It's a big world, so there's a lot more to say. I'll have to come back at some point in the future and, you know, hit the next 10 topics that we didn't get to today.” The host thanked him, saying, “Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser. Thank you as always.”The controversy comes amid Trump’s increasing business engagements with Pakistan. In April, the World Liberty (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by Trump, signed agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and blockchain innovation. Trump and his affiliates reportedly hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, launched in 2024.A US delegation at the signing included WLF co-chairman and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff’s son, Zachary Witkoff.In June, the Pakistan army stated that Field Marshal Asim Munir and Trump had discussed trade, economic development, and cryptocurrency during a White House meeting. “President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” the army said.A month later, Trump announced a trade agreement with Pakistan while threatening 25 per cent tariffs on Indian goods. “We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the agreement, calling it “historic” and expressing hope it would expand cooperation between Islamabad and Washington.",Former NSA and attorney Jake Sullivan has accused President Donald Trump of sacrificing Washington’s ties with India.

Semiconductor push: India hosts 20% of world’s chip design engineers; consumption set to cross $120 billion by 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/semiconductor-push-india-hosts-20-of-worlds-chip-design-engineers-consumption-set-to-cross-120-billion-by-2030/articleshow/123646878.cms,"AI image





India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, placing it as a key player in the global semiconductor design ecosystem, according to a report by Bastion Research.According to news agency ANI, the report underlined India’s strong position in the global semiconductor chain, noting, “India is already an important piece in the global semiconductor design. You may be surprised to know that approximately 20 per cent of the world's chip design engineers are based here.”Global technology leaders, including Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, and MediaTek have set up large R&D and design centres across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida. This strong presence has enabled India to emerge as one of the world’s leading hubs for chip design, as per ANI.Explaining the division of work worldwide, the report said engineers in the United States define the high-level chip architecture, such as deciding the type of chip, its end use, features, and launch strategy.Indian engineering teams, by contrast, take on the critical execution work — translating architecture into logic, simulating and testing chips, optimising performance, writing drivers and firmware, and fine-tuning electronic design automation tools.The report stressed this was not a “boss versus worker” setup but rather complementary roles between US and Indian teams.The Bastion Research findings also noted India’s policy push to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem. The government launched the Semicon India Programme in 2021 with incentives worth around Rs 76,000 crore to attract global manufacturers.India’s semiconductor consumption is projected to rise sharply. “We consume about $24 billion worth semiconductors and it is expected to rise to upwards of $100-120 billion by 2030. When India starts to produce those chips, our share will definitely rise,” Sandeep Kumar, CEO of L&T Semiconductor Technologies and chairman of the Semiconductor Product Leadership Forum, was quoted as saying by ANI.The Forum, launched by the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), aims to build an ecosystem for product design, IP creation, and high-value innovation. It is targeting the launch of around 100 new companies by 2035, expected to absorb nearly five lakh workers, including a large number of engineers.Meanwhile, India recently rolled out its first domestically produced chip at CG Semi’s Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who inaugurated the facility last week, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will “soon” dedicate the country’s first chip produced there.The government has so far approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states. Work is also underway on Semicon 2.0, the next phase of India’s semiconductor mission.","India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, according to a report by Bastion Research.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
