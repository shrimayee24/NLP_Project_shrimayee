RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said there is no rift between the Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said the Sangh can give advice on any issue, but the final decision will be taken by the BJP.The RSS chief said there could be ""difference of opinion"" while working towards the goals of the country, but there was no “manbhed (heart-to-heart differences)”.""There are opinions, but we discuss and form a consensus to decide whether it is against one's opinion or in favour of it. I will follow the collective decision. When that nature is there, quarrel doesn't exist. There can be matbhed (difference of opinion) here, but no manbhed (heart-to-heart disagreement). We need to move forward in one direction, and not different ones,"" Bhagwat said during a three-day lecture series to mark the centenary year of the RSS.Bhagwat said the Sangh has good coordination with the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre, as it did with earlier governments.""We have good coordination with every government, be it state or central. Not only this one. But there are systems that have some internal contradictions.The system (of governance) in general is the same, which was invented by the British so that they could rule. We need some innovation... even if the man in the chair is 100 per cent behind us, he has to do it, and he knows what the hurdles are. He may be able to do it, he may not. But we have to give him independence. There is no quarrel anywhere,"" he said.On the selection of the BJP president, Bhagwat said the RSS has no role. ""It’s completely wrong,"" he said, responding to a question on whether the Sangh decides everything for the BJP including its chief.""We don't decide. If we were deciding, would it have taken so long. We don’t do (decide). We don’t have to. Take your time. We don’t have to say anything,"" he said, drawing applause from the audience.He added that it is not possible for the RSS to take decisions for the BJP.The BJP, he said, has its own expertise in running political affairs, just as the RSS has in managing its shakhas.""I am running shakhas for last 50 years. If anyone advices me on running a shakha, then I am its expert. They are running state (government) for many years. So they are expert in state affairs. We know each others’ expertise,"" Bhagwat said.","Mohan Bhagwat says there is no rift between the Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) The RSS chief said there could be ""difference of opinion"" while working towards the goals of the country.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” He said no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.

‘EC Is Now BJP Commission’: INDIA Bloc Slams CEC, Drops Hint On 'Impeachment' Amid Bihar SIR Row

NEW DELHI: Election Commission sources said Wednesday the poll body had no legal authority to investigate the source or quantum of contributions received by a political party, be it a recognised national/state party or a registered unrecognised political party (RUPP).As per Section 29C of Representation of the People Act 1951, a political party must, on an annual basis, file a contribution report with EC, declaring all donations received in excess of Rs 20,000. Once the party files the contribution report, an acknowledgement is issued through the chief electoral officer concerned. This acknowledgment is used by the party to claim tax relief while filing its income-tax return for the said financial year.“It is the Central Board for Direct Taxes (CBDT) that has the legal mandate to probe the source and extent of contributions received and declared by the political parties,” an official told TOI.Stating that the EC can at most delist a RUPP if it has not contested elections for six continuous years, is not found at its registered address or has not filed its contribution reports and annual audit reports, etc. Delisting makes a RUPP ineligible for tax exemption.EC is already reviewing the fulfilment of these conditions by the RUPPs. Earlier, 537 RUPPs were delisted. Under CEC Gyanesh Kumar, 334 parties were delisted on Aug 9; another 476 were put on notice two days later.There are currently 2520 RUPPs across the country.Interestingly, in the case of the five Gujarat parties that figure among the 10 top RUPPs in terms of donations received, their contributions almost match the expenditure. Also, two of these five Gujarat RUPPs had fought 2024 general election, one the Delhi assembly election in 2025 and the remaining two, the 2022 Gujarat assembly polls.","EC sources say the poll body has no legal authority to investigate the source or quantum of contributions received by a political party.

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Also Read:

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”He further added:""The case was not about the money, as I plan to donate the proceeds to charity. It was about honesty and integrity.... I also hope the size of the monetary reward will deter others from using someone else's identity and believing they will only pay a small penalty.""In 2015, Michael Jordan not only won an $8.9 million verdict but also settled a parallel case with Jewel-Osco, contributing proceeds from both to Chicago-area charities, funding 23 organizations and reinforcing his steadfast commitment to community support and identity rights.Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”At 62, Michael Jordan stands as more than a basketball legend—he is a cultural icon. The Dominick’s case highlights how he fiercely defends his rights and turns his victories into ways to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtWith a $10 million contribution to Novant, Michael Jordan helped open his fourth ""Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic"" in Wilmington, his hometown, in February 2025. The facility, which is 7,300-sq-ft and open to patients from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., offers primary care services in twelve patient rooms for underinsured and uninsured patients across five operating days each weekday. Building on earlier Charlotte and Wilmington clinics, Jordan's sincere comments stressed the importance of providing premium healthcare access to the neighborhood that molded him.Michael Jordan’s $8.9 million lawsuit victory and $10 million clinic donation prove his legacy goes beyond basketball. By defending his name and funding healthcare, Jordan shows integrity, community care, and lasting impact on future generations.In addition to his legal victories and charitable work, Michael Jordan has consistently expanded his philanthropic efforts, surpassing $30 million in healthcare donations since 2017, ensuring underserved communities in North Carolina gain lasting access to quality medical care and support.","Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015.

Key proposed changes include:



A maximum four-year stay limit for F and J visa holders

A reduced post-study grace period for F-1 students, from 60 days to 30

Restrictions on graduate-level F-1 students switching programs mid-course

A 240-day admission cap for I visa holders, with exceptions for certain cases involving China

The United States department of homeland security (DHS) has proposed new regulations to eliminate the current “duration of status” framework for certain nonimmigrant categories and replace it with fixed admission periods, ANI reported.The changes would apply to academic students (F), exchange visitors (J), and representatives of foreign media (I), according to a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE).The DHS said that the current system - which permits these visa holders to remain in the US indefinitely as long as they comply with the terms of their status - does not provide immigration officers with “enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that aliens are engaging only in authorised activities.”If implemented, the proposed rule would require these nonimmigrants to apply for an extension of stay (EOS) with DHS if they wish to remain in the US beyond their approved admission date.The proposed changes follow increasing concerns about visa oversight and national security, with DHS citing a high volume of admissions: over 1.6 million F-1 students, more than 500,000 J visa holders, and over 32,000 I visa holders in 2023 alone.According to the NPRM, “greater oversight would deter fraud and abuse and strengthen the integrity of these nonimmigrant classifications.”The DHS said these changes would align these visa categories with other nonimmigrant classifications that already operate under fixed admission periods and allow officials to “periodically and directly assess whether nonimmigrants are complying with the conditions of their classifications and US immigration laws.”","The United States department of homeland security (DHS) has proposed new regulations to eliminate the current “duration of status” framework.

Poll Should the police have been more proactive in this missing person's case? Yes, they should have acted sooner No, they followed proper procedures





DEHRADUN: Skeletal remains found near Chorabari Tal, a glacial lake around 3km above Kedarnath temple, may belong to a Telangana youth who went missing during a solo trek in Aug 2024, officials said on Wednesday. Local youths from Kedarnath discovered the remains on Tuesday while exploring the area around the glacier.Among the rocks, they found a decomposed bag, a mobile phone, and an identity card from a Punjab-based private university lying near the bones. Police said the ID card indicated the remains could be of Nomula Rishwanth, 24, a third-year BTech student at Lovely University in Jalandhar, Punjab. He had gone missing in Aug last year while on his way back to college after visiting his family in Rajeshwaraopet village in Jagtial district, Telangana.After seeing him off at Mancherial railway station, the family lost contact with Rishwanth, who was expected to travel from Delhi to Jalandhar. When he did not reach the university or respond to calls, his father, a farmer, lodged a missing person complaint with Ibrahimpatnam police in Jagtial.""We have informed the family, and his parents are expected to reach Kedarnath by Thursday to identify the belongings,"" said inspector Rajeev Chauhan of Kedarnath police.""His parents had assumed he may have taken an extended trip, but when there was no communication, they approached Telangana police,"" he added. He confirmed this was the first time local police had been involved in the case. ""We were not contacted earlier about any missing person from Telangana,"" he said.In Hyderabad, Ibrahimpatnam circle inspector Anil told TOI, ""I have suggested to the family that a DNA test should be done to scientifically conclude that the remains are indeed that of Rishwanth. They may travel to Uttarakhand for this purpose. We cannot come to a conclusion about the identity based solely on an identity card being found.""Anil said police had traced Rishwanth's last phone signal to Uttarakhand during the initial investigation but found no further leads. They had also kept checking his social media accounts, which showed no activity. With no case filed in Uttarakhand and no new evidence, the investigation eventually hit a dead end.The sector officer of Kedarnath said the control room was informed as soon as the discovery was made. The skeletal remains and recovered belongings were then transferred to the district hospital in Rudraprayag for medical examination. ""Forensic tests will help establish the identity. Until then, we cannot say anything conclusively,"" said the officer.

The 30-year old tech billionaire and co-founder of ScaleAI , Lucy Guo is making headlines for her intense work ethic and her advice to other startup founders . At the age of 30, Guo has become the youngest self-made female billionaires after Meta made a major investment in her company. After the investment, Guo’s net worth increase to $1.3 billion surpassing popular pop icon Taylor Swift.Apart from this, Guo is also known for her strict daily routine. She starts her day at 5.30 am with back-to-back workouts at Barry’s Bootcamp. She also skips her lunch in order to main her momentum during working hours. In an interview with CNBC, Guo said, “Most people could have work-life balance if they cut out what they waste time on after work—like doom scrolling or watching TV.”Her daily routine also includes working till midnight and socialising till 2 a.m, but she still wakes up early for her workout routine. She claims that her ability to function with minimal sleep gives her more hours in the day as compared to others.Guo also shared an advice for startup founders.

Nvidia’s rise: A talent gap in semiconductors

Nvidia recently reported its second-quarter revenue. The company reported revenue of $46.74 billion, a 56% year-over-year jump, beating Wall Street’s forecast of $46.02 billion. Despite the strong numbers, shares fell 3.14% post-earnings, reflecting investor caution. Billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Theil praises Nvidia’s chip monopoly but cautions against chasing the hype. Theil acknowledged Nvidia’s dominant position in the hardware layer of AI , but suggests that the stock of the world’s most valuable company may no longer be a good investment. Speaking at the All-in Summit in September 2024, Theil talked about his perception on the ongoing AI race .As reported by Bezinga, speaking at the All-In Summit in September 2024, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Pete Theil refused to crown a winner the in AI arm race between Sam Atlman, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Instead of this, Theil turned the spotlight on Nvidia and praised the company for its grip on the hardware layer of AI. He said, ""It's Nvidia, it's the hardware, the chips layer,"" adding that they are ""making all the money while everybody else is collectively losing money.""“Whoever I talk to last … I find very convincing in the moment,” Thiel joked, reflecting on his shifting views after conversations with Musk and others. He criticized OpenAI’s former nonprofit structure as “preposterous,” suggesting its chaotic governance may have justified its pivot to a for-profit model.Thiel attributed Nvidia's current monopoly to a generational shift in talent, noting that after 1993, talented people gravitated toward software rather than semiconductors, leaving the field open for companies like Nvidia to dominate.He emphasised that most of the founders flocked to software, Nvidia quietly focused on building monopoly in GPUs which is now the backbone of AI infrastructure. “They’re making all the money while everybody else is collectively losing money,” Thiel noted.Despite the promising growth showed by Nvidia, Theil voiced his concern about the AI investment frenzy. Comparing it to the dot-com bubble, he said the current climate feels “uncomfortably close to 1999.”He acknowledged Nvidia’s blockbuster performance but warned that its stock may no longer be a bargain. “Maybe a year ago or two years ago, Nvidia would have been a good buy,” Thiel said. “Now everyone knows they’re making too much money and everyone’s trying to copy them.”","PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Pete Theil spoke at the All-In Summit in September 2024.

Here’s the LinkedIn post shared by Anupam Mittal

A founder recently bragged -

‘I get all my ideas from ChatGPT’

He thought it was a flex. I saw a red flag 🚩

Because Gen AI mostly averages existing knowledge. It sounds brilliant > smooth, confident, articulate but too often it’s just platitudes and polite sycophancy.

I’ve seen AI-written mails from senior leaders that read like genius… and meant nothing. In fact, its pretty obvious its a senseless Ctrl C Ctrl V ❌

Same with decks, pitches, even ‘strategy notes’ churned out start-to-finish by a model.

Outsourcing judgement isn't leadership 🤷

The best managers and founders I know use AI for speed and structure but the instinct, the angles, the contrarian call, the uncomfortable decision? That’s all on them.

My take - AI can fake intelligence. It can’t fake courage or an original point of view.

Indian Economy Dead? PM Modi Gives It Back To Trump Amid U.S. Vs India Trade Fight

India to be second largest economy in PPP terms

Size of economy in PPP and market exchange rate terms

“In terms of growth, the Indian economy is the most dynamic, leading the world economy and all other major economies by a significant margin. Its growth is 2.3 times that of the US in 2024. In subsequent years, however, India’s growth is projected to be in the range of 3.1 to 3.6 times that of the US.

If beyond 2030, India and the US maintain average growth rates of 6.5% and 2.1%, respectively, during 2028 to 2030 as forecasted by the IMF, India may surpass the US economy in terms of 2021 PPP-based international dollars in 2038,” says EY in its Economy Watch report.

Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on India

Through strategic measures like import reduction and strengthening domestic demand for exported items, the impact could be limited to 0.1% of GDP.

This suggests a possible 10 basis points reduction in India's projected 6.5% growth for FY2026, potentially adjusting medium-term growth to 6.4%, the report says.





India may surpass the US to become the world’s second largest economy in PPP terms by 2038, according to an analysis by EY in its latest Economy Watch report. The projection assumes significance at a time when the US has imposed 50% tariffs on India, with the American president Donald Trump recently calling India a ‘dead economy’.Globally, most economists and institutions have projected that India’s economy will continue its growth backed by strong domestic fundamentals. S&P and Fitch, both US-based credit rating agencies, have called India’s growth story resilient. While S&P has upgraded India’s credit rating, Fitch has affirmed it despite the US tariff headwinds.When considering market exchange rates, India is set to become the world's fourth-largest economy, surpassing Japan by 2025 (FY26), and subsequently overtaking Germany to secure the third position by 2028 (FY29).EY’s analysis compares five largest global economies: the United States, China, Germany, Japan and India. India is currently the world’s third largest economy in purchasing power parity or PPP terms, and the fifth largest in nominal GDP rankings.According to the EY report, the United States' real PPP economy measures $25.7 trillion in 2024, whilst India's stands at 14.2 trillion international dollars. This 11.5 trillion international dollar difference is expected to reduce substantially by 2030, with US and Indian economies reaching 28.9 and 20.7 trillion respectively, said EY.For meaningful economic comparisons, national GDPs require conversion from local currencies into purchasing power parity (international dollar) measurements. The analysis utilises constant 2021 PPP international dollar figures from the IMF.Also Read | ‘Trump a great peacemaker’: Secret letter from Xi Jinping helps revive India-China ties; move to counter US tariff war Under PPP comparisons, the US economy's share is forecast at 14.7% in 2025. IMF projections through 2030 indicate India will constitute 10.0% of global output (FY31), approximately 4% below the US figure.German and Japanese contributions to global output are anticipated at 2.7% and 2.9% respectively in 2030, over 7% lower than India's projected share of the world economy.The projections indicate India's GDP will reach 34.2 trillion international constant PPP dollars (2021) by 2038.Do Trump’s recently imposed 50% tariffs on India threaten the Indian economy’s growth trajectory? According to EY, India's exposure to US tariffs can be assessed through various metrics, including its export-to-GDP ratio (22.2% average from FY23 to FY25), proportion of goods exported to US within total exports (10.2%), and percentage of Indian exports to US subject to increased tariffs (approximately 40.1%).Considering India's capacity to redirect exports and stimulate domestic consumption, these tariffs might affect roughly 0.9% of India's GDP, says EY.The definitive effect will be determined by how US consumers respond to the tariffs on Indian exports. If one-third of the impact translates to reduced demand, the overall effect could reach 0.3% of India's GDP, projects EY.US economic performance could suffer from retaliatory measures by affected nations. Some experts suggest a possible US recession. Considering a projected decline of 30 to 50 basis points in US growth rates, EY estimates future GDP levels in 2021 PPP international dollars. Under these revised growth projections, India could still potentially exceed US GDP in PPP terms between 2037 and 2038.“At that time, the GDP levels in both countries may be around PPP$32 trillion to PPP$33 trillion. Thus, it may be only a matter of a decade before India becomes the second-largest economy in the world,” says EY.Also Read | ‘Modi’s war’?

Now a health cover without sum insured limitations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/now-a-health-cover-without-sum-insured-limitations/articleshow/123567378.cms,"



Mumbai: For the first time an insurer, Niva Bupa Health, has launched health insurance cover without any sum insured limitation. This removes the need to buy family floaters, top-up covers, critical illness riders, or worry about increasing coverage to keep pace with medical inflation.Niva Bupa Health Insurance has introduced ReAssure 3.0, its new flagship product, which comes in four variants — Classic, Select, Elite and Black — all offering unlimited base sum insured. In the absence of the sum insured the premium is calculated based on the level of comfort chosen by the customer. In the case of Classic the cover entitles the insured for treatment in general wards while with Elite, the customer can choose an exclusive room and the Black variant entitles them to deluxe rooms and suites.“The treatment is the primary focus. Getting covered and getting the best treatment is what matters, not whether they stay in a single room or a general ward,” said Bhabhatosh Mishra, executive director and chief operating officer, Niva Bupa. “We believe this is the last possible innovation on the theme of sum insured, and a true leap forward in making healthcare worry-free.”ReAssure 3.0 also allows Day 1 coverage for 145 pre-existing conditions on payment of an extra premium, doing away with the usual waiting period.In addition, the optional WellConsult+ feature provides outpatient coverage up to five times the base premium, covering consultations, diagnostics, medicines, mental health, dental care and fitness sessions.A Borderless benefit enables treatment abroad, with limits of up to Rs 10 lakh in the Select variant, Rs 50 lakh in the Elite variant and Rs 5 crore in the Black variant. Despite the unlimited coverage, premiums remain competitive. For a 35-year-old, annual premiums start at Rs 10,508 and go up to Rs 15,883 depending on the variant chosen.Mishra said the product renders several legacy concepts irrelevant. “Earlier, families bought floater covers or top-ups to deal with large claims. Now each member enjoys unlimited cover, and the need for such add-ons is eliminated.” Niva Bupa covers 22.5 million lives and operates with a network of 10,488 hospitals. The insurer has maintained a claim settlement ratio above 90% for the last four years, including 93.6% in Q1 FY26.","Niva Bupa Health Insurance has introduced ReAssure 3.0, its new flagship product.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

US shutdown: Trump administration to cut flight capacity by 10% across 40 ‘high-volume’ markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-trump-administration-to-cut-flight-capacity-by-10-across-40-high-volume-markets/articleshow/125120184.cms,"'Beg You, Please Show Up': Republicans' Huge Shutdown SURRENDER To Dems? Mike Johnson & Co Say...





The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that it will cut the scheduled capacity for flights by 10% at 40 “high-volume” markets across the US from Friday morning as the federal government grapples with an ongoing historic shutdown.Secretary of transportation Sean Duffy and federal aviation administration boss Bryan Bedford announced the decision on Wednesday afternoon.The change will affect commercial, private and even space flight and could ground as many as 4,000 flights nationwide. Duffy and Bedford did not yet reveal which airports would be affected, New York Post reported.The shutdown, which became the longest-ever on Wednesday, exacerbated an existing shortage of air traffic controllers who have been unpaid since the start of the shutdown on October 1.“This is proactive,” Duffy explained during a press conference.“We are seeing pressures build in a way that if we allow it to go unchecked, will not allow us to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world. And we are not going to react to that. We intend to be proactive,” Bedford added.October 28 marked the first scheduled paycheck that air traffic controllers did not receive. Duffy noted they were allotted a partial payment in early October.“Our air traffic controllers and a lot of those at DOT and throughout the government, they haven’t received paychecks. And many of these employees, they’re the head of household,” he said.“They have their spouse at home, they have a child or two or three, and when they lose income, they’re confronted with real-world difficulties in how they pay their bills.”Duffy explained that some have resorted to taking “side jobs” to make up the monumental losses brought on by the shutdown.Since the shutdown started, entire air traffic control towers went unmanned during operating hours as airports struggled to fill schedules with willing workers. Others were plagued by endless delays, which officials said would only get worse as the shutdown entered its second month.New York area airports were not spared. Last week, two planes collided on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport amid ever-growing delays for antsy travellers inside, with many stretching beyond two hours.Orlando International Airport, which is at the heart of Florida’s major amusement parks, neared total closure as it repeatedly came close to cancelling all landings.The FAA attributed many of the snares to growing staffing shortages.Duffy said that the agency “figured 10%” was an appropriate number “based on the pressure we were seeing.”“We do not want to see disruptions at the FAA or here at the DOT, but our number one priority is to make sure when you travel, you travel safely,” Duffy said.Bedford assured that the cuts would not affect air safety but would give overworked controllers some relief.Meanwhile, it could take years for the air traffic controller shortage to be addressed, and the shutdown only ground the process to a halt.“It takes years to bring more well-trained certified controllers into the airspace. The shutdown is having an impact on our ability to maintain those numbers and dent that and dent that … shortage that we have,” Duffy said.Duffy previously warned that the Trump administration may close parts of US airspace if the shutdown continued into next week, which would only spur more flight delays and cancellations.","The change will affect commercial, private and even space flight and could ground as many as 4,000 flights nationwide.

Temporary Foreign Workers : Fewer permits, more selectivity:





Canada unveiled its new Immigration Levels Plan for 2026–2028 early Wednesday morning (India time), confirming that the country will hold steady the intake of permanent residents and admit 3.80 lakh annually over the next three years. However, it has sharply curbed the number of temporary residents—especially international students. To illustrate, the immigration levels plan unveiled last year (2025-2027) had projected an intake of 3.05 lakh students for 2026; this is now down to 1.55 lakh and will marginally decline over the next two years.Last year, the three-year levels plan (2025-2027) has for the first time also incorporated target levels for temporary workers (which includes international students and temporary workers); this practice continues. The plan, released as part of Budget 2025, reflects what officials call a ‘balanced approach’ to immigration, stabilising permanent resident levels while moderating temporary inflows.“We will balance the number of new arrivals with the planned departure of international students and temporary workers as their status expires in 2025 and 2026. We have committed to reduce temporary resident volumes through departures, program limits, and lower immigration levels to less than 5% of the population by the end of 2027,” said Lena Metlege Diab, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC).“As we bring our temporary resident population to sustainable levels, we will continue to work with provinces and territories to prioritise people seeking to study and work in fields that will support Canada’s workforce needs in communities across the country including in rural areas,“ she added.In this context, Lisa Brunner, Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC) and post-doctoral research fellow at Centre for Migration Studies, pointed out, “They are also counting on the proposed Bill C-12, also known as ‘Strengthening Canada’s Immigration System and Borders Act,’ being passed into law so they can more forcefully encourage the ‘self-deportation’ of temporary residents with no realistic permanent residency options. Missing from the government’s Levels Plan is the estimated number of undocumented people living in Canada and whether the government expects that number to increase.”International students face the sharpest reductions in the plan, with admissions capped at 1.55 lakh in 2026 and 1.50 lakh in 2027, almost halving the levels announced last year. Last year’s projection was an intake of 3.05 lakh students in both 2026 and 2027.As the number of international students had peaked to 10 lakh by December 2023, in the following month, an intake cap on study permit applications was introduced – for 2024 the cap was expected to result in 2.60 lakh approved study permits, a decline of 35% from the previous year. In this backdrop, while declining intakes were expected, the sharp cut has taken many by surprise.Matthew McDonald, RCIC, noted, “The big surprise is a 50% cut to international students, from the earlier projection of 3.05 lakh to 1.50 lakh in 2026. At first glance, the reduction may not seem significant, because we do not anticipate more than 1.50 lakh study permit approvals in 2025. However, the lower target will also reduce the number of admission offers that colleges and universities can make, putting further pressure on Canada's international education sector. ”Ken Nickel-Lane, RCIC, said: “In this condensed levels plan what immediately jumps out is that international students are hit the hardest within the plan to reduce temporary residents in Canada, with study permits cut by 49.3% across 2026–2028. Continuing the narrative that the previous governments had left the door open to students too wide for too long, and this now requires a severe correction.”Manish Kapoor, RCIC, added that this does not bring good news for Indian students aspiring to study in Canada. “The halving of the study-permit targets means it is going to be much harder to get a study permit—especially for Indian applicants, who are already facing a refusal rate of over 50%. If the application volumes remain high, I anticipate refusal rates could skyrocket to as high as 80%.”Brunner said: “The government is focused on two key goals: reducing the total number of temporary residents to less than five per cent of Canada’s population by the end of 2027, and keeping permanent resident arrivals at less than one per cent of the population beyond 2027.”Canada’s population is around 415 lakh. “The five per cent temporary resident goal is particularly challenging to achieve due to two factors: (1) how structurally dependent Canada has become on temporary workers and international students, and (2) difficulties making reductions in many categories of temporary residents who are in Canada with various humanitarian statuses. It appears the government feels further reductions to international students is the ‘least bad’ option at their disposal.The Trusted Institutions Frameworkannounced in mid 2023, aims to tighten quality control in international education. Institutions with strong student-support systems, transparent finances, and compliance records will be recognised as ‘trusted’, receiving streamlined and speedy visa processing. ""Indian students should focus on trusted institutions and robust financial documentation to maintain strong profiles, especially for the next step towards permanent residence,"" said Naumaan Hameed, lawyer and immigration specialist at Greenberg Hameed PC.Talha Mohani, RCIC, expressed similar sentiments, “I have seen many high school graduates from India face significant challenges in obtaining permanent legal status after completing college in Canada. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that students first complete their bachelors’ degrees and gain relevant work experience before applying.”The target for temporary foreign workers (TFWs) is set at 2.30 lakh for 2026, to be sustained at 2.20 lakh in each of the next two years. The plan unveiled last year had projected TFWs at 2.10 lakh for 2026 and 2.37 lakh for 2027.Manish Kapoor, RCIC, said, “The sharp decline in work permit targets means fewer opportunities for temporary foreign workers, spousal work permit holders, and intra-company transferees, with higher refusal rates expected across these categories.On a more positive note, the new immigration levels plan brings good news for certain work permit holders in Canada. There will be a new permanent residency pathway for 33,000 workers over the next two years, likely targeting high-demand sectors such as healthcare, construction, and Francophone.”The immigration levels plan for 2026-2028, unlike in the past, has not broken down the figures of temporary foreign workers into ‘Temporary Foreign Workers Program' and ‘International Mobility Program (IMP)’ which does not require a labour market impact assessment to be done. The IMP also covers intra-company transfers and post-graduation work permits.Nickel-Lane points out that, “Given the negative pressure we are seeing on the labour market impact assessment (LMIA) related programs – which are more susceptible to fraud and abuse, we would expect more favour to be given to the IMP streams. LMIA stream is also a more easily modified stream which could simply be shut off for industries and regions particularly impacted by US tariffs.”Kubeir Kamal, RCIC, is optimistic about an announcement to introduce an accelerated pathway for skilled H-1B workers, the details of which are yet to be announced. “This ends a strong, proactive message to the global talent pool: Canada is committed to attracting the best innovators and technology leaders to boost our competitiveness and long-term productivity,” he states.","Canada unveiled its new Immigration Levels Plan for 2026–2028 early Wednesday morning (India time) The country will hold steady the intake of permanent residents and admit 3.80 lakh annually over the next three years.

Mizkif Files Federal Lawsuit Following Emiru’s Abuse Accusations





Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo, one of Twitch’s most well-known streamers and a founding member of the OTK content group, has filed a federal lawsuit that’s now shaking the online entertainment world. On November 4, Mizkif formally sued his ex-girlfriend Emily “Emiru” Schunk, fellow streamer Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, and several associated companies, like OTK Media Inc., Mythic Talent Management Inc., and King Gaming Labs Inc., alleging defamation and reputational harm after a wave of abuse accusations surfaced online.The lawsuit follows Emiru’s October 25 Twitch stream, where she accused Mizkif of sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse. According to the lawsuit filed in federal court, Mizkif argues that these allegations were false and have inflicted “significant harm to his reputation and career.” Mizkif is seeking damages for lost earnings, emotional distress, and reputational damage, marking one of the most public and complex legal battles yet to hit Twitch’s tight-knit creator community.After Emiru’s recent Twitch stream detailed her relationship with Mizkif, she described several incidents that left her feeling physically and emotionally uncomfortable.Emiru claimed Mizkif tried to control who she spent time with and continued contacting her after their breakup.Her statements, which included allegations of sexual harassment and distress, sent shockwaves through the streaming community and quickly went viral across platforms.In his own response stream, Mizkif admitted to acting “inappropriately” and being “controlling,” but countered that Emiru had also been violent.He denied the extent of her allegations, accusing her of mistreating her pets and misrepresenting their relationship.Despite his response, most of the streaming community sided with Emiru. Prominent streamers, including Asmongold, publicly condemned Mizkif’s behavior, intensifying the fallout that ultimately led to his dismissal from OTK Media.In his lawsuit, Mizkif accuses Emiru, Asmongold, and OTK of working “in concert” to falsely accuse him of serious criminal activity to damage his standing and seize control of the ventures he helped establish.The legal document emphasizes that none of the organizations involved, including OTK, Mythic Talent, or King Gaming Labs, sought his comment before cutting ties.Additionally, the lawsuit disputes claims that Mizkif owes nearly $896,401.92 in fees to Mythic Talent and King Gaming Labs, asserting that these contractual breach allegations are baseless.Mizkif seeks compensation for “reputational harm, lost earnings, and emotional distress.” He also accuses OTK Media of wrongful termination and reclaiming over one million shares of company stock after Emiru’s allegations became public.According to Mizkif, these actions caused significant financial losses and emotional distress, particularly given OTK’s public statement that cited “threats of personal and professional harm” toward Emiru.Neither Emiru nor Mizkif has publicly commented since their last respective broadcasts, and Asmongold has not addressed the suit.","Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo, one of Twitch’s most well-known streamers and a founding member of the OTK content group, has filed a federal lawsuit.

What Matthew Rinaudo wrote about Emily Schunk in the lawsuit





Twitch streamer Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo has filed a lawsuit against fellow streamer and ex-girlfriend Emily “Emiru” Schunk. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in early November 2025. This comes after Emiru’s October 2025 livestream, where she accused Mizkif of sexual assault, abuse, and harassment. In his lawsuit, Mizkif denies all her claims and shares details about their past relationship.The 12-page document, which became public online, shows Mizkif speaking about his time dating Emiru. He writes that they started dating in 2022 and faced constant online hate. He says Emiru’s followers “routinely” harassed them, and some even stalked her. He also claims they had many fights and that Emiru “threatened to kill herself” during several of them.Mizkif adds that near the end of their relationship, Emiru wanted to marry him and have children within the next five years. But he says he did not agree because things between them were unstable. So he ended the relationship and moved from Austin to Los Angeles in January 2025.In the lawsuit, Mizkif describes how his relationship with Emiru affected him and his career.He says their arguments were “emotionally draining” and that the hate from Emiru’s fans hurt his public image. He also writes that Emiru’s later stream falsely accused him of “psychological and domestic abuse, stalking, harassment, sexual assault, and threats of blackmail.”The filing lists three main claims.First, Mizkif accuses OTK Media and King Gaming Labs of breach of contract. He says they tried to take away over a million shares of stock he owned.Second, he accuses Emiru and streamer Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt of defamation. He says their public comments caused “severe emotional distress” and “mental anguish.”Finally, he requests a declaratory judgment about ownership and company rights involving OTK, Mythic Talent Management Inc., and King Gaming Labs.Also Read: Hasan Piker’s Viral Support For New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani Turns Loud As He’s Denied Entry At Rally After the lawsuit became public, Asmongold reacted during a stream. He said Mizkif could “end up in jail” and called him “spiraling.” That clip quickly spread on X and Reddit.As of now, none of the parties, Mizkif, Emiru, or OTK, have posted any official responses to the filing.

Can a mayor effectively reform Mumbai if the role is strengthened with real powers?





MUMBAI: Ameet Satam, newly appointed president of the Mumbai BJP, has vowed to prevent any attempt to “change the colour” of the city, as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections approach.Satam, a three-term MLA, has previously raised concerns about communal polarisation, warning that attempts are underway to divide the city for vote-bank politics.He referenced the recent election of Zohran Mamdani as New York City’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor as an example of “changing the colour” of a city.In a post on 'X', Satam wrote, ""Just as the color of some international cities is changing, after seeing the surnames of some mayors and witnessing the Maha Vikas Aghadi's vote jihad, it seems necessary to stay cautious in the context of Mumbai..! If someone tries to impose a 'Khan' on Mumbai, it will not be tolerated! Wake up, Mumbaikars..!""His remarks drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Anand Dubey said, ""Ameet Satam's mental state has deteriorated. From the day he became president, he realised he was about to be wiped out... That's why he's been making bizarre statements about the mayor of Mumbai from day one... May God give wisdom to people like Ameet Satam. I confidently say that a Marathi Hindu will become the mayor here...Under Ameet Satam's leadership, the BJP is sure to be wiped out. ""Satam also criticised alleged corruption in the BMC, claiming misappropriation of Rs 3 lakh crore between 1997 and 2022, and said the BJP would ensure greater transparency and accountability in civic administration.This question resurfaces periodically, and it has gained attention again following Zohran Mamdani’s historic election as mayor of New York City on Tuesday.Mumbai, with a population exceeding 12 million—much larger than NYC—faces challenges due to a tangle of public agencies that rarely coordinate, often deflecting responsibility.This fragmentation has caused overlapping jurisdictions, poor accountability, inefficient service delivery, wasted resources, and delayed infrastructure projects. Key agencies that sometimes work at cross purposes include the BMC, MMRDA, Mhada, SRA, MMRCL, railways, airport authority, and MbPT.Unlike the NYC mayor, Mumbai’s mayoral role is largely ceremonial, with a term of just 2.5 years. The mayor is elected by corporators rather than directly by citizens, with the majority party’s candidate usually assuming the post.The mayor chairs BMC general body meetings, but most executive and administrative authority lies with the municipal commissioner.","Ameet Satam, newly appointed president of the Mumbai BJP, has vowed to prevent any attempt to “change the colour’ of the city.

NYC Mayoral: U.S. Democrat's SHOCK PREDICTION After Zohran Mamdani's Stunning Victory





MUMBAI: Can a mayor for Mumbai whip this city back into shape provided the post is reformed to give it teeth?This question comes back to haunt the city from time to time, and now again, with the historic win of Zohran Mamdani, elected mayor of New York City (NYC) on Tuesday.Greater Mumbai, with a much larger population (over 12 million) than NYC, has a mishmash of public agencies running the city which seldom coordinate and often pass the buck, leaving citizens confused.This has led to overlapping jurisdiction, lack of accountability, inefficient service delivery, wasted resources and delayed infra projects.Among the multiple agencies which sometimes work at cross purposes are the BMC, MMRDA, Mhada, SRA, MMRCL, railways, airport authority and MbPT.Unlike the NYC mayor, the post of Mumbai mayor is largely ceremonial with a term of 2.5 years. The mayor is elected, not by citizens like in NYC, but from among corporators.The party with most corporators gets its candidate elected as mayor. As first citizen, the mayor presides over BMC general body meetings. However, most of the executive and administrative powers are with the municipal commissioner.On the other hand, the NYC mayor has enormous powers. ""Not only do they supervise a staff of over 300,000 people, a budget of over $120 billion, a GDP of $1.3 trillion - that's bigger than 10 other countries.We're in the top 10 in the world. Considering 1 million kids in our public schools, 10 million people at any given time, 30,000 cops, it's a lot of power,"" J C Polanco, professor at the University of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx, told CBS News.Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora said he always believed Mumbai needs a more empowered mayor with executive powers. ""The exact nature of that structure and devolution of powers can be debated, but in principle, I support the idea. I personally would prefer the idea of a directly elected mayor, but I am open to hearing other views on how we can empower and hold Mumbai's mayor more accountable,"" Deora said.He added, ""This is essential to have someone that can coordinate with multiple agencies in Mumbai, including from the Centre. I believe having a directly elected mayor is a good option as it will raise the profile of the election and senior leaders will aspire to become the city's mayor.""Mumbai BJP chief Ameet Satam said the mayor already has powers in BMC as all works and issues are first passed either in the standing committee or any other committee and then come to the general body, which is chaired by the mayor.Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray said the mayor needs more executive powers and the BMC needs more administrative powers. ""Firstly, we should have elections that are free and fair. 1 real person, 1 vote,"" he said.City Congress chief MP Varsha Gaikwad said, ""I believe only a directly elected and empowered mayor can pull us out of this mess. Today, planning, implementation, and monitoring of policies are split across multiple agencies, with almost no coordination. What Mumbai needs is a mayor who functions like the city's CEO, someone who is politically and culturally invested in its future, with the mandate and executive authority to deliver real change. A mayor who is directly answerable and accountable to the citizens of Mumbai."" MNS's Mumbai president Sandeep Deshpande said when more powers were given to mayors in the past through the mayor-in-council system, there was rampant mismanagement and the city suffered.Mumbai did experiment with a powerful mayor 25 years ago. And it turned out to be a failure, forcing the then Shiv Sena-led govt in Maharashtra to scrap what was called the mayor-in-council' system.In 1997, the govt decided to alter the administrative structure of BMC with the centre of power shifting from the municipal chief to the mayor. The idea was mooted by the then CM Manohar Joshi, who was mayor of Mumbai in the 1970s.In 1998, the new system was introduced with Sena's Nandu Satam becoming the first empowered mayor even as then civic chief Girish Gokhale had to play second fiddle. But within weeks, incidents of bungling, dubious decisions and an apathetic attitude towards solving the city's problems came to the fore. Tussles broke out between the mayor and some mayor-in-council members over lucrative civic contracts.Many civic officials took a back seat and passed on the buck on decisions to mayor-in-council members. In early 1999, when Joshi stepped down as CM and was replaced by Narayan Rane, the latter ordered a review of the system. The system was later scrapped.","Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City on Tuesday. The post of Mumbai mayor is largely ceremonial with a term of 2.5 years.

'I'm Broken': Lone AI-171 Crash Survivor Speaks Out; Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK

Viswashkumar Ramesh and his brother Ajaykumar





LEICESTER: Four-and-a-half months after the June 12 crash of Air India flight AI 171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, the only survivor, 39-year-old Viswashkumar Ramesh, remains physically injured, financially strained and deeply traumatised.Viswashkumar Ramesh, who was in seat 11A next to the emergency exit, walked away from the burning wreckage that killed 241 of the 242 people on board (230 passengers and 12 crew). His younger brother Ajaykumar, seated in 11J, was among the dead. After brief treatment in India, Ramesh returned to the UK on Sept 15 but says he has not yet received NHS psychiatric care. He struggles to walk, cannot drive, and largely isolates himself at home in Leicester. “Mentally I have completely broken down,” he says.The family’s fishing business in Diu, which Viswash ran with his brother, has virtually collapsed, cutting off income. His wife’s universal credit was halted after she travelled to India for two months post-crash. Air India has offered an interim payment of £21,500 (Rs 25 lakh), to be adjusted against any final compensation — an amount Ramesh calls inadequate given UK living costs and his ongoing medical needs.Community leader and expert in crisis management Sanjiv Patel and crisis adviser Radd Seiger — who are assisting the family — say both Air India and the UK authorities have not provided timely, tailored support. Seiger says repeated requests for a meeting with Air India’s top leadership have gone unanswered.Air India said it is “deeply conscious” of its responsibility to Ramesh and all affected families, adding that senior Tata Group leaders have met families and an offer to arrange a meeting with Ramesh’s representatives remains open, with outreach continuing.For now, Ramesh’s focus is on pain management, mobility, and securing mental-health support as he grieves his brother and contemplates an uncertain future.","Viswashkumar Ramesh, 39, was in seat 11A next to the emergency exit.

China has shut Nvidia out

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of sites globally.","China has shut Nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, CEO Jensen Huang said.

Social media platform Reddit experienced an outage in several countries, including the US and India. The disruption affected thousands of users rendering them unable to use the platform, before the company successfully implemented a fix. At its peak, more than 20,000 reports of issues with Reddit were logged by users in the US alone, according to the outage-tracking website Downdetector. India also saw a significant spike, peaking at around 500 reports.Reddit quickly acknowledged the disruption on its status page and deployed corrective action.“The issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented. We are continuing to monitor for any further issues,” the company initially stated. About an hour later, the platform confirmed that the issue “has been resolved,” restoring service to affected users globally.The Reddit outage is the latest in a series of service disruptions across the technology sector.Recently, a massive outage in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing network caused widespread issues, hitting several major applications, including Reddit. That incident, which occurred on October 20, briefly disrupted a third of the internet after a Domain Name System (DNS) error at AWS’s Northern Virginia data center compromised the ability of apps to access their data.Additionally, Microsoft's Azure network also faced an outage last month that affected several websites, services and apps including Microsoft 365, Xbox and NatWest.Microsoft's Azure status page later confirmed problems with Azure Portal access. On its status page, Azure's network infrastructure was showing as “critical” in every region in the world, underscoring the global scale of the problem.Microsoft said it believed the outage was a result of ""an inadvertent configuration change"", and that it planned to remedy the situation by rolling the service back to a recent backup known to be functioning correctly.","Reddit experienced an outage in several countries, including the US and India.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Microsoft’s cost-cutting strategy delivers record margins as stock climbs above $500







Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period, CEO Satya Nadella announced, marking the first clear timeline for ending a hiring freeze that has seen over 15,000 employees cut in 2025 alone.The tech giant laid off 9,000 workers in July—its largest single round of cuts this year—followed by thousands more eliminated in January, May, and June as Nadella pushes employees to ""unlearn and relearn"" their jobs using AI tools before he'll approve new hires. The workforce purge represents a stunning reversal from fiscal 2022, when Microsoft expanded headcount by 22% in a pre-ChatGPT hiring spree.""I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,"" Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on the BG2 podcast that aired in early November.Nadella explained that the hiring pause isn't permanent—it's a strategic transition period allowing workers to fundamentally reshape how they perform their roles using AI. Employees need time to integrate tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot into their daily workflows before the company expands again.""It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,"" he said, comparing the shift to how email and Excel spreadsheets revolutionised workplace productivity decades ago.The CEO shared an example of a Microsoft networking executive who, facing massive data center expansion needs, built AI agents to handle maintenance tasks instead of hiring additional staff. ""That is an example of a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,"" Nadella noted.Despite the layoffs weighing heavily on Nadella personally—he addressed employee concerns in a July memo—investors have rewarded Microsoft's cost-cutting approach. The stock surged above $500 for the first time in July, and the company recently reported its widest operating margin since 2002 alongside 12% year-over-year revenue growth.Microsoft previously implemented selective hiring freezes in its U.S. consulting division in January 2025 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, though strategic areas like Azure cloud services continued recruiting throughout those periods.The company now expects all work to begin with AI integration. ""Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues,"" Nadella explained.","Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period.

As reported by CNBC, this latest round of job cuts of the company will impact thousands of employees as the company continues to move towards high-margin software and artificial intelligence services. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” an IBM spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.”IBM has the global headcount of approximately 2,70,000 employees at the end of 2024, so if the company plans even to layoff 1% of its employees then it will impact around 2,700 employees.The upcoming round of layoffs comes as part of IBM’s broader organisational realignment under CEO Arvind Krishna. The software giant is now sharpening its focus on AI-driven cloud services and software as both the areas have shown strong growth. In its recent earnings report, IBM posted better-than-expected results, driven by a 10% increase in software revenue.A report by The Wall Street Journal revealed that earlier this year, IBM eliminated job roles in marketing and communications and also replaced around 200 human resources positions with AI agents.The company has since redirected hiring efforts toward sales and software development roles.This latest move by IBM mirrors the current trend in the tech industry, where companies are laying off staff in order to streamline operations and also boost productivity. Last month, e-commerce major Amazon announced its plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, whereas Facebook-parent Meta said that it would eliminated 600 roles in its AI division.Despite the layoffs, IBM still maintains its workforce in the US will remain stable year-over-year, suggesting that the job cuts may be more concentrated in international markets or non-core business units.While IBM has not yet disclosed the departments and regions affected by the upcoming job cuts, but emphasised that the restructuring is part of a long-term strategy to align its workforce with emerging growth areas. “We routinely review our workforce and at times rebalance accordingly,” the company said in a statement.","IBM has announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, offering transformative possibilities across industries while simultaneously raising significant societal concerns. Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the “Godfather of AI” and a Nobel Prize-winning expert in machine learning, has warned about the profound economic and ethical implications of this technology. Hinton cautions that, as AI adoption accelerates, tech billionaires like Elon Musk could see substantial financial gains, while millions of workers risk losing their jobs to automation. He emphasises that the challenges lie not only in the technology itself but in how society is structured, highlighting the urgent need to address the social and economic impact of AI alongside its technological development, urging global leaders to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in its integration.In an interview with Bloomberg Wall Street , Hinton has repeatedly highlighted that AI is not inherently harmful, but its unchecked development can lead to major societal disruption. He compares the potential dangers of AI to a “Chernobyl moment,” referring to the 1986 nuclear disaster in Ukraine that released lethal radiation and caused massive casualties. For Hinton, this analogy illustrates how technological progress, if not properly regulated, can create sudden and devastating consequences for society.He warns that the risks of AI extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society. “The reason it’s bad is because of the way society’s organised,” Hinton explained. “Musk will get richer, and a lot of people will get unemployed, and Musk won’t care. I’m using Musk as a stand-in. This isn’t an AI problem; it’s a societal organisation problem.”One of Hinton’s primary concerns is that the rapid development of AI is being driven by corporate greed rather than public interest or safety. Tech giants are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to gain a competitive edge, often prioritising profits over ethical considerations.The four major AI hyperscalers: Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon are projected to increase their combined capital expenditure from $360 billion this fiscal year to $420 billion next year. OpenAI alone has announced partnerships and infrastructure deals valued at $1 trillion with companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. These figures highlight the immense financial stakes tied to AI, which Hinton believes incentivise job replacement over societal well-being.Hinton predicts that large-scale AI adoption will inevitably lead to widespread job losses. He argues that corporations cannot achieve maximum profit without replacing human labour with AI-driven systems. Recent evidence supports this concern. For example, job openings have dropped by approximately 30% since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, especially in entry-level positions.Amazon’s announcement of 14,000 layoffs, predominantly in middle management, further illustrates this trend. While CEO Andy Jassy attributed the decision to “culture,” an internal memo predicted a leaner workforce as the company implements efficiency gains through extensive AI deployment. Hinton’s warnings suggest that this pattern of AI-driven unemployment is likely to accelerate as corporations continue investing in automation technologies.Despite the risks, Hinton acknowledges that AI has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits. In healthcare, AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy, accelerate drug discovery, and improve patient outcomes. In education, AI-driven platforms can personalise learning experiences and broaden access to quality instruction.Hinton stresses that the challenge lies in balancing these benefits against the risks of social inequality and mass unemployment. “It’s a difficult decision because it can do tremendous good too,” he said. “Increasing productivity in many industries should be beneficial, but society must manage these changes to prevent vast numbers of people from being left behind.”When asked whether he would halt AI development altogether if possible, Hinton expressed uncertainty. “I don’t know… it’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he remarked. This highlights the complex ethical considerations surrounding AI: it is neither entirely harmful nor entirely beneficial. Policymakers, industry leaders, and society must navigate a delicate balance between innovation and safety.Hinton’s insights underscore the need for thoughtful regulation and societal planning to ensure that AI technologies enhance human well-being rather than exacerbate inequality and unemployment. The rise of AI presents both extraordinary opportunities and serious risks. While billionaires like Elon Musk may see unprecedented financial gains, millions of workers risk displacement.","Geoffrey Hinton warns that the risks of AI extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society.

Abu Dhabi issues 61 warnings and shuts down two shops over tobacco sales violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-issues-61-warnings-and-shuts-down-two-shops-over-tobacco-sales-violations/articleshow/125117981.cms,"Abu Dhabi Registration Authority issued 61 warnings and closed two shops after violations related to illegal tobacco sales near schools/ Image: X

A focus on public health and consumer protection





Rigorous inspection campaigns and business compliance





“The limited violations recorded in various areas of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, compared to the number of operating commercial establishments and the number of field visits and inspection campaigns, demonstrate the high rates of compliance with the laws and regulations governing commercial activities,”

“This confirms the effectiveness of awareness campaigns in spreading knowledge in the business sector and helps to ensure the highest standards of health, safety, and transparency.”

Legal framework for tobacco control





The impact of excise tax and broader regulatory landscape









Abu Dhabi's continued efforts to regulate tobacco and electronic cigarette sales have intensified with the closure of two commercial establishments and the issuance of numerous warnings and violations. These measures reflect the Emirate's commitment to public health, especially near educational institutions, as part of an ongoing initiative to ensure strict compliance with federal and local regulations governing tobacco sales.In an effort to safeguard the community, especially young people, the Abu Dhabi Registration Authority (ADRA) has ramped up its inspections, with a particular focus on businesses operating near schools and educational institutions. During the first ten months of 2025, ADRA conducted 1,661 field visits and 21 inspection campaigns targeting tobacco and e-cigarette vendors. These efforts are part of Abu Dhabi's broader strategy to maintain a transparent, fair, and secure business environment.The crackdown led to the closure of two commercial shops that failed to comply with federal laws and Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED) regulations.In addition, ADRA issued 61 warnings and 18 violations for non-compliance. Violations included the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors, improper display of tobacco items at checkout points, and home delivery of tobacco goods—practices that breach the stringent regulations set forth in the UAE’s tobacco control laws.ADRA's fieldwork this year highlights its dedication to a safe and fair business environment. The inspections conducted by the agency show a strong commitment to not only enforcing legal measures but also educating the public and business owners about compliance. While the violations recorded were significant, they were limited when compared to the total number of businesses and inspections conducted.In line with these efforts, ADRA aims to promote the importance of consumer rights and the protection of intellectual property and trademarks. These inspections, along with ADRA’s enforcement actions, underscore the UAE's prioritisation of public health, particularly in vulnerable areas such as school zones. The authority’s Director General, Mohammed Munif Al Mansouri, underscored the effectiveness of these campaigns in raising awareness within the business sector.he said.The UAE’s commitment to public health is rooted in a series of federal laws and regulations that govern tobacco sales. Among the most significant is Federal Law No. 3 of 2016, known as Wadeema's Law, which prohibits the sale of tobacco and tobacco products to minors. This law gives retailers the right to ask customers for proof of age before completing a sale and extends restrictions to smoking in the presence of children in both public and private transportation.Additionally, Federal Law No. 15 of 2009 on Tobacco Control imposes various penalties on violators, including prohibitions on advertising tobacco products, the sale of tobacco to minors, and the operation of shisha cafes within 150 meters of sensitive areas like schools and mosques. The law also regulates the sale of products that resemble tobacco and imposes restrictions on the use of automatic vending machines for tobacco products. This legal framework is designed to prevent easy access to tobacco products, especially for young people, and aims to reduce smoking-related health risks.The excise tax on tobacco products, as stipulated by Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2019, plays a pivotal role in discouraging tobacco consumption in the UAE. The excise tax rate for tobacco is set at 100%, significantly increasing the cost of these products and, by extension, curbing their consumption.As part of this strategy, the UAE government has also introduced more stringent controls on public smoking. Initiatives to limit tobacco use in public spaces, including parks, beaches, and recreational areas, have already been implemented in Dubai. Other areas, such as Sharjah, have gone a step further by banning all forms of smoking in public areas. In the future, the National Tobacco Control Committee aims to impose a full ban on smoking in public spaces, further solidifying the nation’s commitment to reducing smoking-related health issues.","Abu Dhabi Registration Authority issued 61 warnings and closed two shops after violations related to illegal tobacco sales near schools.
