Bill proposes Rs 2 crore fine on illegal universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-proposes-2cr-fine-on-illegal-univsities/articleshow/125968660.cms,"NEW DELHI: Any university or higher education institution established without approval of Central or state govt would face a penalty of at least Rs 2 crore and immediate closure, as per the new higher education bill — Viksit Bharat Adhishthan Bill — which is likely to be introduced in Lok Sabha on Monday.The bill circulated to MPs on Sunday evening also proposes that higher education institutions will be required to disclose financial details, audits, infrastructure, faculty information, courses, outcomes and accreditation status on a public portal maintained by the regulatory council as well as on their own websites. The disclosed data will form the basis for accreditation and regulatory oversight.TOI has learnt that govt is also likely to introduce a bill to replace the rural employment guarantee law, MGNREGA, on Monday. Sources said that though the Cabinet had last week approved the Pujya Bapu Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Bill, the acronym of the bill may be changed when it’s introduced in the House. The Bill proposes to guarantee 125 workdays per household as against 100 provided under the present law and would focus more on creating tangible assets in rural areas.As per the proposed Viksit Bharat Adhishthan Bill, there would be a common regulator for higher education, including universities, IITs and IIMs — Viksit Bharat Shiksha Viniyaman Parishad — having 14 members headed by a president.Its mandate would be to ensure coordination, maintenance of standards, and compliance with regulatory provisions across universities and higher educational institutions (HEIs).The regulatory council will promote a “light but tight” regulatory approach, emphasising transparency, accountability and autonomy. The bill proposes that all higher educational institutions would be required to achieve full accreditation in a graded manner, enabling them to become autonomous, multidisciplinary institutions offering high-quality education, research, vocational training and skilling programmes.The bill proposes to empower the regulatory council to take corrective action within 60 days in cases of misrepresentation, financial impropriety or administrative lapses. It proposes a robust grievance redressal mechanism for students and other stakeholders, ensuring fair and transparent handling of complaints.To enforce compliance, the bill proposes a graded penalty system. It says that for the first contravention of the Act or related rules, the regulatory council may issue a written notice seeking clarification and rectification. If the institution fails to fix the lapse within the specified period, it would face a penalty of at least Rs 10 lakh. In case of a repeated violation, the council would impose a penalty of at least Rs 30 lakh and may also recommend removal of officials concerned, review or downgrade the institution’s academic and administrative autonomy, or withhold govt grants until compliance is achieved.For persistent or continuing violations, the penalty would be at least Rs 75 lakh, and the institution may face suspension of degree-awarding powers, loss of affiliation or even closure, with such recommendations being placed in the public domain.","Any university or higher education institution established without approval of Central or state govt would face a penalty of at least Rs 2 crore and immediate closure.

"Army to get 3 Apache attack copters, Navy to induct Seahawks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-to-get-3-apache-attack-copters-navy-to-induct-seahawks/articleshow/125968313.cms,"Representational photo

NEW DELHI: In a boost to India’s rotary wing combat capabilities, the Army is now finally set to get delivery of its three remaining Apache AH-64 attack helicopters from the US, while the Navy will also commission its second squadron of MH-60R Seahawk submarine-hunting choppers this week.The induction of these much-delayed American helicopters will plug existing operational gaps but the real punch will come when the Army and IAF hopefully begin getting 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters from 2028 onwards.Overall, the armed forces want over 1,000 new helicopters of different types in the next 10-15 years to make up for major deficiencies as well as replace obsolete Cheetah and Chetak fleets. They include 484 light utility helicopters in the 3.5-tonne class and 419 Indian multi-role helicopters in the 10-15-tonne class, but there have been huge delays in these projects being executed by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The three Apache gunships, dubbed “tanks in the air” since they are armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, will touch down in India “within a couple of days”, defence officials told TOI.India had ordered six heavy-duty Apaches for the Army in a Rs 5,691 crore deal with the US in Feb 2020, under which the first three were delivered in July after a huge delay due to supply chain problems faced by Boeing.These six Apaches will add to the 22 such choppers inducted by IAF in 2019-2020 under a Rs 13,952 crore deal with the US in Sept 2015. The Army Apaches will be deployed at Jodhpur, where a squadron was raised in March last year to cater for the western front with Pakistan.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, in turn, will commission the second squadron of Seahawks, armed with Hellfire missiles, MK-54 torpedoes and precision-kill rockets as well as advanced sensors, at INS Hansa in Goa on Dec 17. The first squadron was raised at INS Garuda in Kochi in March 2024.The US has so far delivered 15 of the 24 Seahawks, which are manufactured by Sikorsky-Lockheed Martin, under a Rs 15,157 crore contract in Feb 2020. Incidentally, the defence ministry last month inked another Rs 7,955 crore contract with the US for follow-on support and spares for the multi-mission helicopters.While quite expensive, the Seahawks are crucial because the 140-warship Navy is currently grappling with just a handful of old Sea King and Kamov-28 anti-submarine warfare helicopters at a time when the presence of Chinese submarines is only going to further increase in the Indian Ocean Region.HAL has to deliver the Prachand light combat helicopters -- 90 for Army and 66 for IAF -- in the 2028-2033 timeframe under the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract inked in March this year.The Prachand helicopters will be armed with 20mm turret guns, 70mm rocket systems and air-to-air missiles for offensive operations and precision-strikes in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Siachen Glacier on the borders with China and Pakistan.The 156 highly-agile Prachand helicopters, each weighing 5.8 tonne, will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and 5 Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract in 2022.","The Army is finally set to get delivery of its three remaining Apache AH-64 attack helicopters from the US.

SC: Employment on compassionate ground no ladder for promotion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-employment-on-compassionate-ground-no-ladder-for-promotion/articleshow/125966593.cms,"SC: Recruitment for other posts governed by rules applicable for all

New Delhi: In an important ruling, Supreme Court has said that a person employed on compassionate grounds to alleviate family difficulties because of death of a parent in harness cannot seek appointment to higher posts merely because they have the requisite qualifications for the same.A bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and Manmohan on Friday reversed a Madras HC judgment directing Tami Nadu govt to promote two persons initially appointed as sweepers on compassionate grounds, due to death of their fathers, as Junior Assistants as they had the requisite qualifications for that post at the time of their appointment in 2007 and 2012. Both had approached the HC in 2015.The bench said employment is provided on compassionate grounds to the eligible kin of an employee who dies in harness to enable the family of the deceased to tide over difficult times. ""Such appointment which is arising out of exceptional circumstances cannot be used as a ladder to climb up in seniority by claiming a higher post merely on the basis that he/she is eligible for such post,"" it said. Justice Bindal said once the dependent of a deceased employee is offered employment on a compassionate basis, their right stands exercised. ""Thereafter, no question arises for seeking appointment to a higher post.Otherwise, it would be a case of 'endless compassion',"" he said.The bench said compassionate appointment is a relief against financial hardship caused by the sudden and unforeseen loss of the earning member of a family, and employment to the kin of the deceased is provided under such circumstances to ensure that the family members do not face impoverishment.The SC said recruitment for other posts are governed by rules and regulations which apply to all eligible candidates. Thus, it would be impermissible to allow a person who has entered employment through compassionate grounds to bypass the process of recruitment and get promoted to a higher post, it said.""An applicant for the post on a compassionate basis may be eligible for any higher post, but that does not mean he has the right to be appointed on that post. This depends on the rules and the policy applicable and also the number of vacancies to be offered in that category. In fact, this is not an additional source of recruitment, rather an exception to the general rule of providing equal opportunities to all for recruitment in government jobs,"" SC said.","Supreme Court reverses Madras HC judgment directing Tami Nadu govt to promote two persons initially appointed as sweepers on compassionate grounds, due to death of their fathers.

Panel gives Justice Varma 6 weeks to respond to charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/panel-gives-justice-varma-6-weeks-to-respond-to-charges/articleshow/125966590.cms,"Unaccounted Currency Notes Were Recovered From Official Residence

New Delhi: The three-member inquiry committee headed by Supreme Court Judge Aravind Kumar has asked Justice Yashwant Varma, facing removal motion in the Lok Sabha in the aftermath of discovery of wads of burnt and unaccounted currency notes from his official residence, to respond to the memo of charges against him.In its Dec 5 proceedings, Justice Varma sought eight more weeks to respond to the charges of misconduct framed against him by the committee - comprising Justice Kumar, Madras HC Chief Justice M M Srivastava and senior advocate B V Acharya - that was constituted under the Judges (Inquiry) Act on Aug 12 by LS Speaker Om Birla pursuant to a removal motion signed by 146 MPs.The committee granted Justice Varma six more weeks to file a detailed response to the charges and said no further time would be granted to him for this purpose. The proceedings are scheduled to resume in the last week of Jan.The inquiry panel has supplied the memo of charges along with evidence, mainly comprising videos of the burning cash recorded by Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel on the night of March 14-15 while dousing a fire in a room inside the judge's Lutyens Zone bungalow and statements of witnesses recorded by the in-house inquiry conducted by another three-member panel set up by former CJI Sanjiv Khanna.During the proceedings before the inquiry panel, constituted by the LS speaker, Justice Varma will have the opportunity to counter the charges, produce witnesses in support of his innocence and can cross examine witnesses supporting the memo of charges against him. A week after the discovery of the cash on his residential premises, Justice Varma was transferred from Delhi HC to his parent HC at Allahabad. He has been stripped of judicial work since then.On March 22, then CJI Khanna set up a three-member in-house inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Chief Justice G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman. This panel had submitted its report dated May 3 to the CJI on May 5.The in-house panel had rejected Justice Varma's defence that the cash had been planted to defame and discredit him, and said that it ""has no hesitation in holding that in the backdrop of direct as well as electronic evidence of unimpeachable character, further corroborated by the evidence of the experts, the issue of presence of cash in the storeroom situated within 30, Tughlaq Crescent, New Delhi, is established. "" It had recorded that the electronic evidence, mainly comprising videos and still photographs taken by the first responders, were found to be authentic by the Central Forensic Laboratory, Chandigarh.The panel's 64-page report had recorded that wads of half-burnt 500 currency notes in Justice Varma's official residence storeroom were cleaned up in the early hours of March 15 by ""trusted servants"" under the supervision of his private secretary after he talked on phone with the judge, who was out of station.","Justice Yashwant Varma is facing removal motion in the Lok Sabha in the aftermath of discovery of wads of burnt and unaccounted currency notes from his official residence.

NEW DELHI: With air quality worsening sharply across the Delhi-NCR, authorities on Saturday invoked the strictest restrictions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan, triggering emergency curbs across the region. This comes hours after implementation of GRAP stage III measured in the national capital region.The Commission for Air Quality Management said its GRAP sub-committee had decided to enforce all measures under Stage IV or ‘Severe+’ air quality with immediate effect after pollution levels crossed critical thresholds. In an official statement, the panel said, “Keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and in an effort to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the region, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP decides to invoke all actions as envisaged under Stage-IV of the extant GRAP ‘Severe+’ Air Quality (DELHI AQI > 450), with immediate effect, in the entire NCR. ” It added that these steps would be in addition to restrictions already in force under Stages I, II and III.In an official order, the government directed that all administrative secretaries and heads of departments shall attend office regularly, with no more than 50 per cent staff strength physically present.""The remaining 50 per cent staff shall work from home, provided that the Administrative Secretaries and Heads of Departments can call officers/officials to the office, as required to ensure uninterrupted delivery of essential and emergency public services,"" the order read.Likewise, the order stipulated that all private offices operating within Delhi shall function with no more than 50 per cent staff physically attending the workplace.""The remaining staff shall mandatorily work from home,"" it added. The order also urged all private entities to implement staggered working hours where feasible. Furthermore, private offices have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with work-from-home norms and minimise vehicular movement related to office commutes.""Hospitals and other public/private health establishments, Fire Services, Prisons, Public Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation and related municipal services, disaster management and related services, forest and environment departments/agencies engaged in air pollution control, monitoring, and enforcement activities (like teams deployed to curb biomass burning, dust control, GRAP measures, etc. ), and other essential/emergency services shall be exempted from these directions,"" the order said.The decision came hours after Delhi slipped back into the ‘severe’ category, prompting the reimposition of Stage III curbs earlier in the day. According to official data, the city’s Air Quality Index, which stood at 349 on Friday evening, surged overnight and was recorded at 401 by Saturday morning due to slow wind speeds, a stable atmosphere and unfavourable meteorological conditions that hampered the dispersion of pollutants.According to news agency ANI, As of 7.00 PM, AQI readings were 488 in Anand Vihar, 434 in Ashok Vihar, 496 in Bawana, 457 in Burari, 479 in Chandini Chowk, 394 in IGI Airport, and 445 in Okhla Phase-2.Also read: Delhi AQI turns 'severe': GRAP Stage III reimposed across NCR; what's allowed & what's not A dense layer of smog enveloped the capital on Saturday morning, reducing visibility and intensifying health concerns. Wazirpur recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 445, followed by Vivek Vihar at 444, Jahangirpuri at 442 and Anand Vihar at 439. Several other areas, including Rohini, Ashok Vihar, Narela, Mundka and Bawana, also remained in the ‘severe’ range.Poor air quality conditions extended beyond Delhi, with parts of Uttar Pradesh also reporting dense smog. Noida sectors recorded AQI levels of 448, while visibility dropped in cities such as Bulandshahr, Ayodhya and Mainpuri amid fog and haze.Under CPCB norms, an AQI between 401 and 500 is classified as ‘severe’ and poses serious health risks, particularly for children, the elderly and those with respiratory ailments.

What is Pink Tax ?



It may sound like a trivial question, but the answer points to a deeper issue: the Pink Tax

.

The Pink Tax shows up across everyday life:

Personal care products:

Fashion and accessories:

Cosmetic procedures:

Healthcare

:

How marketing makes femininity costlier



The safety tax: Paying to feel safe



Housing: Where safety overrides affordability



The unpaid labour tax



Healthcare and fertility pressure



The pay gap makes the burden heavier



The ‘career loss’ tax



Does simply existing as a woman cost more?



Does society acknowledge how expensive womanhood is?



I don’t think society fully acknowledges how expensive womanhood is because many of these costs are normalised and invisible. They’re framed as ‘choices’, not necessities. Until we recognise these expenses as structural rather than personal, women will continue to bear them quietly, without much conversation. Priyanka Mukherjee

Is safety treated as a luxury rather than a right?



The bill may be invisible, but it’s paid daily.

What is luxury?For a woman, simply being able to take a walk at night is often considered a luxury. But this freedom isn't free. It comes at a cost most people never see, the extra money, effort and emotional labour women pay every day just to exist.Every rupee women spend is backed by labour, yet when it comes to buying everyday essentials, its value seems to shrink. Every morning, as I get ready for office, I inevitably spend more than a man would and not because I am extravagant, but because of the hidden taxes I pay every time I buy something.Why? Because a moisturiser packaged in lavender tones, promising ""smooth skin"" , costs more than a man’s basic black bottle offering the same function. When I calculated my spending on personal care, clothing, services and daily necessities, the pattern became impossible to ignore.How? Because women consistently pay more year after year simply because products are marketed to them. And no, this isn’t just a Western problem. India isn’t exempt.It is not a government levy or an official surcharge. Instead, it is the invisible premium women pay for products and services marketed ""for women"" , even when they are nearly identical to men’s versions.Simply put, it’s the cost of being a woman. Many everyday products aimed at women are priced higher than their male counterparts despite serving the same purpose.""I think most people have little idea of the extra costs a woman has to bear simply to exist. There is a concept of ‘Pink Tax’ that few men are aware of, as it mainly involves women’s personal care products. Beyond the monetary aspect, there is also a safety angle to all this,"" said Aashish Saxena.That’s the Pink Tax — and that’s why a pink razor costs more than a man’s black one.Women’s shampoos, conditioners and moisturisers routinely cost more than men’s, even when the difference is limited to packaging or colour.Women’s formalwear and accessories are often priced higher despite similar materials and construction. The markup is usually explained away as ""fashion"" or ""finishing"" .Aggressively marketed to women, adding to the financial burden.Gynaecological check-ups, fertility consultations and reproductive healthcare come with higher recurring costs.""If you book a full comprehensive check-up for men on the health/medical app, it costs Rs 4,999, but for women, it costs Rs 5,999,"" said Pallavi, pointing to the hidden cost.Women are often seen as less price-sensitive when it comes to personal care, not because they want to be, but because many of these products are framed as necessities. Companies exploit this shift. What was once optional is now presented as baseline: SPF, retinol, serums, AM/PM routines, laser treatments, Botox, hair removal, marketed as ""permanent"" solutions that never truly end.""If we look at the market, the range of products available for women the variants and the overall maintenance and is far wider compared to men. The skincare industry largely targets women, giving men limited space under the idea of toughness,"" said Vijaya Srivastava.Pallavi also points to fashion as another quiet contributor to the hidden tax. ""Why can’t I have jeans with normal-sized pockets that can fit today’s phones?"" she asks.""Men can just slip their phones into their pockets and walk freely. Why do we have to carry a handbag just to hold a phone? Because we don’t have pockets."" Her frustration reflects how design choices, driven by fashion norms and commercial interests, create yet another invisible cost: one paid in convenience, money and everyday freedom.Beyond products, women quietly absorb another cost, the safety tax! In urban India, women often pay a premium simply to move through the city. Public transport that is cheaper for men is not always an option. Cabs, safer buses or higher travel classes become necessities, not luxuries.Ignoring buses, trains and shared autos ""just to feel safe"" is common and expensive. ""While men don’t have to think twice about getting into a crowded metro or bus, a woman might opt for a far more expensive cab just to avoid harassment,"" said Aashish.Aastha Jha explains the cost she absorbs every month. ""I pay Rs 6,000 for travel to office every month. I haven’t used shared autos, buses or the metro enough to even compare. My area is quite secluded with poor connectivity, so sharing doesn’t feel safe.""She adds that this expense isn’t consciously planned. ""I don’t budget for it deliberately, but I’ve been doing it subconsciously for years.""While men may think about safety during odd hours, Aastha notes the difference during the day. ""Men my age think about safety late at night. During normal hours, they don’t have to factor it in.""For women, even basic freedoms come with anxiety. ""Being able to take a walk at night feels like a luxury. Whether you live in a gated society or a secluded area, you never really know who could harm you.""Her colleague Vivek Dubey agrees. ""Safety matters to everyone, but not in the same way. I can book a cab at midnight without much thought. My main concern is the driver’s driving, not my personal safety.""He admits this is a privilege men often overlook. ""I can take a bike taxi because it’s cheaper. I wouldn’t recommend the same to my female friends because of harassment risks.""Safety also dictates where women live.""When I came to New Delhi, my priorities were safety and security,"" recalls Jyoti, a college student. ""I looked at high-rise societies with rents far above my budget, but I had no choice,"" she said.Natasha Singh adds, ""Safety plays a huge role in evaluating cost of living."" After a robbery at her home, she and her flatmate were more concerned about security than stolen items. ""When my flatmate was not in town, I used to travel all the way from Noida to Gurgaon to live with my parents because I didn’t feel safe living alone.""Women also bear the burden of unpaid domestic and emotional labour: cooking, cleaning, caregiving and emotional management, the work that doesn’t show up in GDP calculations.Menstrual products are unavoidable expenses men do not face. Beyond that, women incur ongoing costs linked to reproductive health, PCOS, fertility testing, supplements and preventive check-ups.""Women experience more frequent health milestones and transitions, which leads to higher spending on routine medical care and supplements — costs that are rarely framed as healthcare burdens,"" said Priyanka Mukherjee.""The biggest hidden tax that I pay, I think, is healthcare tax. Firstly, female health is the least talked about. And because of that, even the most basic tests cost thousands. And I am just talking about tests, have not even started on medication, consultation,"" said Aastha.Period poverty adds another layer. Despite GST removal on sanitary pads in 2018, one in ten girls under 21 in rural areas still cannot afford menstrual products.Women earn less but pay more.In India, women earn approximately Rs 40 for every Rs 100 earned by men. The country ranks 131 out of 148 in the Global Gender Gap Report 2025.""Yes, I do believe women are often paid less than male colleagues with similar experience or output, though the gap is not always obvious on paper. It shows up in slower growth, fewer leadership opportunities, or being expected to ""prove"" consistency over time,"" said Priyanka reflecting on the disparity that only makes the burden of the Pink Tax feel heavier.Vijaya highlighted what she sees as one of the biggest hidden taxes women pay at work. ""I’ve had colleagues with the same or even less work experience earn a higher CTC than me. I’ve also seen my female colleagues having to switch jobs more frequently than men simply because companies don’t make retention offers to them,"" she said.""Men, on the other hand, are often retained. There’s never been an official declaration, but the pattern is quite evident. Having to repeatedly adjust to new environments is another hidden tax I’ve noticed,"" she added.The Pink Tax doesn’t just hurt wallets — it reinforces inequality!Safety concerns also push many women out of high-paying night shifts or demanding roles altogether. A budding journalist, Oshin, said she considered quitting because late working hours didn’t feel feasible for her.Living far from work, she didn’t want to take on the additional financial and emotional burden of arranging safety every night.Smriti Jain believes it does. ""Simply being a woman comes with higher, unavoidable expenses. While awareness is growing, the true economic impact is still not fully acknowledged,"" she said.Natasha echoed the sentiment, saying, ""From daily transport to monthly periods, our lives are forced to be comparatively more expensive. Whether it is shopping for toiletries or simply getting a haircut, everything is more costly, marketed as a better lifestyle choice.""Priyanka, speaking candidly, agreed. ""Honestly, yes. Simply existing as a woman costs more — financially, emotionally and mentally. From safety planning and health spending to clothing choices shaped by social scrutiny, there are constant micro-costs attached to being cautious, prepared and presentable,"" she said.She added that one of the biggest hidden taxes rarely discussed is mental bandwidth. ""The cost of constantly thinking ahead. ‘Is this safe?’ ‘Should I stay late?’ ‘Do I need a cab?’ ‘Will this be misread?’ That constant vigilance has an economic value we never calculate.""""For many women, safety often feels like something you have to plan and pay for, rather than something that simply exists,"" she added.Vivek acknowledged the disparity. ""Yes, I do think simply existing as a woman costs more, financially, mentally and emotionally. But I don’t think society truly acknowledges it. There’s a kind of collective blindness around this issue. It’s almost as if society has accepted that it’s expensive to be a woman and decided this is just how things are,"" he said.Rajeev Singh another male colleague of Vivek also agreed. ""Men generally have greater flexibility to compromise on comfort or safety. Social norms, lower levels of harassment and fewer restrictions on movement allow men to accept risks that would be unreasonable or dangerous for women. Womanhood does appear costly — even if you subtract safety-related expenses,"" he said.Aastha believes the issue is deeply structural. ""Absolutely. Society itself has made womanhood expensive by keeping research and technological development that could genuinely benefit women scarce,"" she said.""An HPV vaccine that could prevent cervical cancer costs thousands. These are exactly the areas that should be mass-produced, considering women make up nearly half the country’s population,"" she added.Priyanka, however, feels the burden remains largely invisible.Natasha believes it is. ""It's a known fact that women feel more restricted even if it’s self-imposed, after a safety incident occurs in their vicinity. When a DU student was harassed outside a girls’ college, the response was to put up posters listing ‘dos and don’ts’ for women. That tells you everything. Our safety is treated like a joke, not a basic right,"" she said.Vivek added that meaningful change requires structural effort.""Real change would require going back to the basics, changing policies, enforcing laws, redesigning public spaces, and challenging everyday behaviour. That takes effort and intent. And perhaps that’s why the issue is often ignored, even though it affects the dignity and daily lives of nearly half the population,"" he said.Taken together, these everyday choices where women live, how they travel, the work they take on and the risks they avoid rarely show up as line items in budgets or policy discussions.Yet they quietly shape women’s freedom, mobility and opportunities in ways that are easy to overlook but hard to escape.","Every rupee women spend is backed by labour, yet when it comes to buying everyday essentials, its value seems to shrink. Every morning, as I get ready for office, I inevitably spend more than a man would and not because I am extravagant, but because of the hidden taxes I pay every time I buy something.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125962672,imgsize-12650,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

How Bangladesh’s Feb 12 Vote Could Reshape India’s Northeast Access And Regional Power Balance

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday firmly rejected assertions made by the interim government of Bangladesh, saying New Delhi has consistently supported free, fair and inclusive elections in the neighbouring country and has never allowed its territory to be used for activities hostile to the interests of the Bangladeshi people.In a statement responding to a press note issued by Bangladesh’s interim government, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said India ""categorically rejects"" the allegations levelled against it and reiterated that it has never allowed its territory to be used for activities inimical to the interests of the Bangladeshi people.""India has consistently reiterated its position in favour of free, fair, inclusive and credible elections being held in Bangladesh in a peaceful atmosphere,"" the MEA said, adding that New Delhi’s stance on the issue has remained unchanged.The response came hours after Bangladesh summoned high commissioner Pranay Verma to its foreign ministry, conveying what it described as ""deep concern"" over Sheikh Hasina , who is currently in India, being allowed to make ""provocative statements calling on leaders and activists to engage in terrorist activities"" in Bangladesh.During the meeting, Dhaka also formally sought the immediate extradition of Sheikh Hasina. It further raised what it called ""anti-Bangladesh activities"" by Awami League members residing in India, alleging that they were attempting to disrupt the country’s upcoming national elections.In its statement, the MEA rejected any suggestion that India was complicit in destabilising Bangladesh. ""India has never allowed its territory to be used for activities inimical to the interests of the friendly people of Bangladesh,"" it said.At the same time, the MEA placed emphasis on Dhaka’s responsibility to ensure stability during the electoral process. ""We expect that the interim government of Bangladesh will take all necessary measures for ensuring internal law and order, including for the purpose of holding peaceful elections,” the MEA added.","India rejects assertions made by the interim government of Bangladesh.

Energy Efficiency Across States: Who’s leading the charge





Celebrating small wins

This Energy Conservation Day: Don’t waste what you don’t use.

Every month, millions of Indian households pay for electricity they never actually use. The lights might be off, the fans switched down, but hidden leaks quietly drain energy, inflate bills, and add to the country’s carbon footprint. Unlike water dripping from a tap, electricity leaks have no sound, no puddle, no visible cue. So, it goes unnoticed and we don’t react. From chargers left in sockets to old appliances that hum non-stop, these silent drains often called “phantom loads” cost families thousands of rupees each year and contribute millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions nationally.Meet Urja,On the surface, she seems like the poster child for energy consciousness. She turns off lights before leaving a room, switches off fans, monitors unnecessary usage, and genuinely believes she's doing more than her part. She even scolds her younger brother for leaving the kitchen light on. But the truth sits quietly in the corners of her home long after she’s stopped noticing.When you zoom in, cracks appear. Urja’s refrigerator, a sturdy 12-year-old unit that has probably watched her grow from a child to a working adult, gulps far more electricity than she imagines.She recently bought a new AC, but to save money, she picked a three-star model instead of the more efficient four- or five-star options. Her chargers, laptop, phone, tablet,and Wi-Fi stay permanently plugged into the socket because “it’s too much effort” to unplug them. The fridge door remains open while she chats about work gossip. Her microwave glows like a digital clock. And the TV? That one never gets unplugged, just in case she wants to switch it on “for background noise” while doomscrolling.Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? These are the small, invisible slips that quietly drain energy, money, and the planet.A problem cannot be solved without acknowledging that it exists in the first place. Habits cannot be unlearned without awareness of their silent effects. And wastage cannot be curbed in our homes and offices until we recognise the leaks, the ones hiding in our everyday appliances tthat urgently need fixing.Environmentalist Kavita Ashok calls these hidden electricity leaks “vampire energy” — the silent drain that happens even when appliances appear to be off.“Energy drains in homes have an interesting name —. I call it the phantom power used by household appliances when they’re left plugged in even when we aren’t using them. This is serious for our environment, as the CO₂ emissions from this alone account for nearly 1% of total emissions. It also reduces the lifespan of domestic appliances due to constant wear and tear More so the electricity bill shoots up by 5-10% by this unnecessary power consumption”Every year on December 14 , India observes National Energy Conservation Day , a moment meant not just to raise awareness but to remind citizens that energy efficiency is a shared responsibility. Introduced in 1991 and championed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) , the day reflects India’s commitment to reducing unnecessary consumption and promoting sustainable practices and that is not possible without energy conservation which is the cornerstone of sustainable development.Energy conservation isn’t merely a matter of turning off lights. It’s about recognising deeper patterns in the devices we buy, how long we use them, how we maintain them, and the behaviours we normalise in our homes and institutions. The day calls for introspection: Are we actually conserving energy, or just feeling like we are?Because the hidden truth is that much of India’s electricity is wasted long before it lights a bulb or cools a room.A large part of India’s electricity silently disappears into what experts call “invisible drains” — electricity we pay for but never actually use. Somesh Kumar, partner and leader, Power & Utilities, EY India, explains that this loss can be grouped into three major categories: Phantom Loads, Inefficiency Losses, and Structural Leakage.Often termed “ghost power,” this refers to electricity drawn by appliances even when switched off. Set-top boxes, Wi-Fi routers, TVs, gaming consoles, and chargers continue consuming power silently to maintain internal clocks or remain ready for remote-control operation.This alone accounts for 5–10% of household electricity consumption , costing families Rs1,500–Rs3,000 annually and adding up to nearly Rs 200 billion nationally .Old or poorly maintained appliances such as air conditioners, refrigerators, fans, washing machines become energy-hungry over time. Dust-clogged filters, worn-out seals, and aging motors force them to work harder, increasing consumption by 10–15% in many households.Faulty wiring, old circuits, and leakage currents can silently inflate household electricity bills by around 9% . In offices and institutions, mis-calibrated systems, aging motors, and refrigerant leaks can push waste up to 12% of total consumption. All this occurs without any visible sign which makes it particularly dangerous.These quiet leaks are far more serious when placed in context with India’s power generation mix.In 2024, fossil fuels, primarily coal, still contributed 78% of India’s electricity. Every watt wasted at home directly translates into:When phantom loads, old appliances, and wiring losses across millions of households are added together, they contribute millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions every year. Energy wastage isn’t just a household problem, it's a climate problem.A quick survey conducted among a small group of people revealed a pattern that most people were willing to adopt cost-effective energy measures and cared about the environmental impact of hidden energy drains, which highlights that most energy waste isn’t because people don’t care. It’s mostly because:But it does, especially when multiplied by India’s millions of households..Another reason revealed was lack of awareness. Many people didn’t even know that standby consumption exists and what actually is the star rating that we see on appliances.Ishita Mahapatra, 23, said “Honestly, I never checked star ratings before buying any appliance. I was curious about what they meant, but I assumed it was just some pricing gimmick. I usually focus more on features and how the product looks, and wasn't aware or particularly concerned about how much electricity it might consume or waste while buying”.The State Energy Efficiency Index 2024 shows that the domestic sector accounts for nearly one-third of India’s electricity consumption, highlighting how crucial household actions are.Even those aware often don’t have the time or motivation to unplug devices, maintain appliances, or check wiring.Many households opt for cheaper, old-tech or low-star appliances because they cannot afford more efficient models. Ironically, this results in higher electricity bills, a long-term penalty for a short-term saving.On being asked why he thinks energy wastage continues to happen in his home, Shivendra Singh, 26, said, “We’ve all heard and seen energy-saving campaigns, but I think the problem is that we’ve never really experienced electricity scarcity firsthand.”“There’s no visible consequence when we waste power. So we underestimate the harm. Because the impact isn’t immediate or personal, it’s easy to ignore it in daily life”, he added.Somesh Kumar, Partner and Leader, Power & Utilities, EY India explained how Urban households waste more energy overall because of higher appliance density — ACs, large fridges, multiple TVs, routers, smart devices. Cooling inefficiencies and standby loads dominate their silent losses.Rural homes, though consuming less power, surprisingly waste more per device due to:“With 86% of rural households historically dependent on biomass, electrification is growing rapidly. If rural India adopts low-efficiency appliances now, these could remain in use for 10–15 years, locking in long-term inefficiency. Cities waste more because they use more. Villages risk wasting more because their choices today shape consumption for a decade” said Somesh Kumar.Your smartphone scrolling, cloud backup, digital payments, streaming all depend on massive data centres. These energy-intensive facilities require extensive cooling, magnifying their consumption. If the digital economy grows faster than renewable energy integration, India's coal dependency will deepen. Digital convenience, too, comes with a rising environmental price.Satnam Singh, Senior Practice Leader & Director at Crisil Intelligence, underscores the scale of household inefficiency at a time when India’s energy demand is soaring and the country is trying to shift to cleaner, more efficient systems. He explains that despite advances in technology and policy, the biggest energy losses often occur inside our own homes—long before electricity is put to any productive use.“As India pushes toward cleaner energy and smarter consumption, a surprising amount of electricity is still being lost inside our own homes—long before it reaches any productive use. Old refrigerators, air conditioners, fans and TVs consume far more power than modern models… often using 40–60% more electricity.Many devices never fully switch off… This standby load can account for up to 10% of a household’s consumption. Every unit wasted at home means more fuel burned for power generation… Cutting this invisible consumption is one of the fastest, lowest-cost ways to reduce emissions. This Energy Conservation Day, remember: the cleanest energy is the energy we never waste.”Even the smallest habits like leaving a charger plugged in, a microwave display glowing, a router humming nonstopextract costs from both the environment and the household wallet.Many of these steps cost nothing but save 5–12% on bills.India’s energy efficiency performance varies significantly across states, according to the State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI) 2024 released by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in association with the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy. The index evaluates 36 states and union territories across seven sectors including buildings, industry, transport, agriculture, municipal services and DISCOMs using 66 indicators to assess how effectively regions are implementing energy‑saving measures. In the latest rankings, Maharashtra topped the list overall , followed closely by Andhra Pradesh , while Assam and Tripura led in their respective energy‑use groups based on total consumption. Five states Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu were classified as “front runners” for scoring above 60% on the index. States such as Assam and Kerala made it into the “achiever” category, showing solid implementation, while several others including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh were placed in the “contender” group, highlighting room for stronger action. These varied performances reflect not just differing consumption patterns but also how state‑level policies and on‑ground execution shape energy efficiency outcomes.Just like we cut a cake to celebrate joy, perhaps we can celebrate Energy Conservation Day every day by cutting down energy wastage. Small, mindful acts — unplugging a charger, turning off a router at night, closing a fridge door promptly, can collectively move India towards a greener, more efficient future.Energy conservation isn’t just a national mission. It’s a household habit that can significantly contribute to India’s energy conservation goals for the years to come.The story of energy waste is invisible, but the solutions are tangible, low-cost, and achievable. All it takes is awareness, a shift in habits, and a little daily mindfulness.","Every month, millions of Indian households pay for electricity they never actually use.

SHANTI likely to boost India’s nuclear power capacity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shanti-likely-to-boost-indias-nuclear-power-capacity/articleshow/125966404.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet’s approval for Atomic Energy Bill, officially titled the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, which is set to be tabled in the winter session of Parliament, signals a huge policy shift in India’s atomic sector that is expected to accelerate civil nuclear energy production in the country.Proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 and later in liability laws aim to attract private and foreign investment and overcome obstacles in the 2008 Indo-US Nuclear Deal by easing supplier liability concerns (CLNDA), potentially unlocking stalled US projects like Kovvada. Till now, the key stumbling block to US investment in India has been CLNDA, which allows operators to seek recourse from suppliers, deterring US firms like Westinghouse. Legal amendments are expected to address these issues, potentially creating a framework for insurance or govt indemnification and making projects viable for US companies.The amendments are designed to finally implement the stalled Indo-US nuclear agreement, which has led to little progress beyond fuel imports due to liability issues, and enable US reactor construction in India. These nuclear reforms are linked to broader Indo-US trade talks, aimed at boosting bilateral trade and investment, with nuclear cooperation as one of its key pillars.The bill will open up the sector to private players (up to 49% equity) and foreign companies, breaking the long-standing govt monopoly in the sector. It will also consolidate existing laws into a single, comprehensive statute to enhance regulatory clarity and investor confidence and will help India fulfil its goal of creating 100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The SHANTI Bill will break the domination of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in core activities such as atomic mineral exploration, fuel fabrication, equipment manufacturing and, potentially, certain aspects of plant operations.The trigger for these drastic changes in the legal framework in the nuclear sector was the slow expansion of nuclear power capacity as the technology development phase had to go through an international embargo and technology denial regime, besides facing limited availability of resources. Though India operates the sixth largest nuclear reactor fleet in the world, the present installed capacity of nuclear power is just 8.78 GW (excluding RAPS-1, 100 MW). The share of nuclear power in total electricity generation in the country in 2024-25 was about 3.1%, the govt said in a statement.The indigenous pressurised heavy-water reactor (PHWR) technology has now matured for larger size reactors (700 MW). With the deployment of indigenous 700 MW reactors and 1,000 MW reactors with international cooperation, the present capacity will increase to 22.38 GW (excluding RAPS-1, 100 MW) by 2031-32 on completion of projects at various stages of implementation.The preferred small modular reactor (SMR) technology is the light water reactor-based pressurised water technology. Based on PWR technology, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), a constituent unit of DAE, has initiated design and development of 200 MWe Bharat Small Modular Reactor and 55 MWe Small Modular Reactor, for the repurposing of retiring fossil fuel-based power plants, captive plants for energy intensive industries -- such as steel, cement and process industries -- and off-grid applications for remote locations. BARC is also developing up to 5 MWth (Megawatt thermal) high temperature gas cooled reactor for hydrogen generation.","Proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 and later in liability laws aim to attract private and foreign investment.

NEW DELHI: In the middle of Laxmi Nagar market is a single room, easy to miss in the chaos, that holds a few chairs. Seated are young men and women from Delhi, UP and Haryana, busy polishing 'Ikura desu ka' and 'tetsudatte kuremasu ka', Japanese phrases that translate, respectively, to 'how much is this' and 'can you help me'.Some labour on the 'u', only to be reminded by the teacher not to dwell on it. ""Not ikoora. Suppress u, stress ra.""It's not an easy lesson for this group of native Hindi speakers but motivation is strong, so they keep at it. Getting spoken Japanese right will earn them a ticket to a job that will pay more than anything they are likely to get here.With curbs on immigration rising in the West, Indians have in Japan been presented with a destination in the east that has a high demand for young workers, especially in caregiving and blue-collar occupations like plumbers and electricians. In Aug this year, the Indian and Japanese governments signed a pact for potential exchange of 5 lakh personnel in five years, including 50,000 skilled workers.And with jobs beckoning, Japanese language teaching has taken off in NCR, not just in physical classrooms like the one in Laxmi Nagar but in online listings of tutors saying 'Konichiwa' to not just Japan job seekers but also those preparing for JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) and anime fans as they promise proficiency tailored to the learner's need.According to data with Japan Foundation on language education abroad, the number of Japanese learners in India went from 5,446 in 2003 to 52,946 in 2024. The total number of teachers - at primary, secondary and higher education levels - has risen from 256 to 5,446 in the corresponding period.Owing to its ageing population, Japan needs caregivers at hospitals and for eldercare. Salaries in these jobs, converted to INR, begin at about Rs 80,000 a month. A nursing qualification is not mandatory; basic proficiency in the language - which is the N4 level - is enough.Sudha Rotili has already secured a job and will be flying to Hokkaido soon. While pursuing a master's in maths from a Delhi University college, she felt her degrees might not be enough to get a good job abroad and enrolled in a Japanese course earlier this year. ""My friend, who is a nurse, learnt it last year and now works in Japan as a caregiver. I thought this was something I could do. It would also give me a headstart abroad,"" Sudha says, adding she will make a saving that will also let her remit money back home.Japanese has three scripts - Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. Though it has almost no similarity to languages widely spoken in India, some teachers say it comes easier to native Hindi speakers because the grammar is similar. ""They do not have to first think of translating to English and then Japanese, they can do a Hindi to Japanese translation in their minds,"" says a teacher.Anushka, a 21-year-old nursing graduate learning Japanese at a centre in Okhla, doesn't know if that worked to her advantage, but is confident about holding a basic conversation in Japanese. ""Watashi wo namae wa Anushka. Hajimemashite (My name is Anushka. Nice to meet you),"" is how she introduces herself to make her point.Anushka says her lack of fluency in English made her apprehensive about attempting to take on Japanese. But once she dived in, she began enjoying herself, downloading an app to practise and watching Japanese TV shows.Jaspreet Kaur, a first-year political science student, says she is ready to take up any job in Japan for the exposure. She enrolled at the Okhla centre this year and will start applying for jobs soon.Divesh Birla, who has been teaching Japanese since 2007, says he gets two kinds of students - schoolkids who want to pick up a language early, and of late, adults who are learning for the purpose of employment. Birla, who teaches at Govt Polytechnic College in Haryana, says many students are coming from lower-income backgrounds. ""They feel like a job in Japan will be their family's ticket to a good life,"" he says. Ambica Gupta, who runs Masaru Institute for Japanese language in Faridabad, says though she has been teaching for the last 12 years, it's only in the last four that she has seen a boom in interest. ""I used to have just two-three students per class, but from 2021, every batch has 10-15 students. I don't want to make the classes bigger, but there are more people expressing interest. Every batch is full,"" she says.Shrishti Arora, who started NEC Institute in Lajpat Nagar seven years ago, adds: ""I've noticed that people who come to us are not just interested in learning the language, they are serious about the opportunities it can get them. They inquire about jobs and higher studies.""(Additional reporting by Ayantika Pal)","With curbs on immigration rising in the West, Indians have in Japan been presented with a destination in the east that has a high demand for young workers.

New Delhi: Delhiites could see poison in the air on Sunday. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to ‘severe-plus’ category for the first time this year.The city’s 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec — 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.","The city’s 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months.

NEW DELHI: In every organisation, be it government or private, increment in an employee’s salary is an annual affair. Not in Supreme Court, where CJIs, on the eve of retirement and irrespective of length of tenure, used discretionary powers to sanction multiple increments to a select few employees.Those who had been Chief Justice of India for a short tenure, too, granted two or three increments in addition to the annual one in salaries to employees — mainly the chief justice’s personal staff or those who had performed exceptionally well and displayed organisational skills.While all 2,000-odd employees received at least two to three additional increments in their pay scale in the last four years, there were some lucky ones in CJIs’ good books who earned as many as six additional increments to get 150% of what should have been their salaries in the normal course.To correct the anomaly in pay scales and salaries of employees caused by discretionary sanctioning of increments, former CJI B R Gavai had called a full court meeting of all judges to discuss the issue. Most judges felt neither was SC a kingdom nor CJI a king to distribute increment largesse to a select few.After a detailed deliberation, the full court decided to stop this practice and withdraw discretionary increments given to employees in the last few years.It was also decided that discretionary allotment of increments would henceforth be decided in the full court, sources told TOI.Those who had got additional increments, apart from annual increments given every year, suddenly discovered their salaries had been reduced considerably. It came as a shock to those who had planned their budgets based on the increased salary — like taking house or vehicle loans that had to be repaid through EMIs.Some of those who had put in additional work and performed exceptionally well to get the increments said their monthly salaries were reduced considerably, in some cases up to Rs 40,000, and vented their ire against one or two registrars who, according to them, briefed the then CJI incorrectly on the issue.TOI spoke to a cross-section of employees, the majority of whom said that it would have been better had SC adjusted the additional increments against future annual increments. That would have kept their salaries intact and enabled them to maintain household budgets and investments in houses or vehicles.","Some lucky ones in CJIs’ good books earned as many as six additional increments to get 150% of what should have been their salaries in the normal course.

Reflecting the state's culture and democratic values, the building, he said, would stand as a symbol of both heritage and progress.Using an analogy from Jashpur's archery tradition and the Mahabharata, Sai said Chhattisgarh now has a single-minded focus. ""Like Arjuna's eye on the bird, our target is a developed Chhattisgarh,"" he said, adding that the state has a clear and achievable plan to reach that goal.Work on the vision document began soon after the government took office, Sai said.It was prepared through wide public participation, involving farmers, youth, women, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders. Describing it as carrying the ""fragrance of the soil,"" he said the plan reflects the spirit of Antyodaya — development for the last person in the queue.The document identifies 13 priority sectors and 10 key missions, with good governance at the core. According to the CM, over 400 governance reforms implemented in the past two years have already made administration more transparent and citizen-friendly.Taking a political swipe at the previous Congress regime, the Chief Minister alleged that while his government has a vision for development till 2047, the Congress's five-year rule was marked by ""systematic loot"" through an organised syndicate. He claimed central agencies have placed concrete evidence of financial irregularities before courts and said the public has understood the ""true character"" of the opposition.Sai highlighted major gains in road, rail and air connectivity, expansion of premier institutions like IIT, IIM and NIT, and growth in medical education, with medical colleges increasing from 10 to 15, in addition to AIIMS.A new industrial policy and a single-window clearance system have helped attract investment proposals worth over Rs 7.5 lakh crore, he said.On energy, Sai said Chhattisgarh ranks second nationally in power generation and aims to top the list by 2030, with a strong push towards renewable energy, including large-scale solar projects and rooftop solar with double subsidies. He also underlined opportunities in agriculture, forest-based economy, mineral resources and tourism. Concluding, Sai expressed confidence that the goals outlined in the Anjor Vision 2047 would be realised from the new Assembly building and called upon all members to work together to translate the vision of a developed Chhattisgarh into reality.Congress boycottsAssemblyCongress boycotted the Assembly on the first day of the winter session, held on Dec 14, in protest against the government's decision to dedicate the entire sitting exclusively to a discussion on ""Vision 2047."" Congress claimed that this approach sidelined routine legislative business, including Question Hour, Calling Attention notices, and adjournment motions. Leader of Opposition Charandas Mahant described the presentation as misleading, arguing that it focused heavily on long-term plans and promises while ignoring pressing day-to-day issues faced by the people, such as unemployment, delays in paddy procurement, crimes against women, potholes, lack of tap water, and electricity billing problems.He accused the government of using the session to project a futuristic agenda without addressing current grievances, and termed the vision document ""heavy on claims but weak on substance.""Mahant said the Congress's boycott was a way to protest the sidelining of ordinary legislative business and highlight the government's neglect of immediate public concerns.","Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai unveils ""Anjor Vision 2047"" in the Assembly.

"Trai rejects DoT’s proposal to keep BSNL’s satellite spectrum charges at 1 percent, calls it ‘discriminatory’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trai-rejects-dots-proposal-to-keep-bsnls-satellite-spectrum-charges-at-1-percent-calls-it-discriminatory/articleshow/125963030.cms,"NEW DELHI: The standoff between the department of telecom (DoT) and regulator Trai regarding recommendations for satellite spectrum is intensifying, with the latter now raising objections to lower charges being sought for state-owned BSNL’s services.As differences between the two critical organisations come out openly over satellite spectrum charges and other areas such as subsidies, the preferential treatment accorded to BSNL has now been flagged off as “discriminatory” by Trai which has refused to agree with DoT’s views on the subject.In its recommendations given to DoT earlier this year, Trai had recommended that spectrum charges for GSO (Geostationary Orbit) and NGSO (Non-Geostationary Orbit)-based Mobile Satellite Services should be levied at 4% of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). However, in its assessment of the recommendations, DoT asked Trai to have a re-look, saying that spectrum charges for BSNL may continue to be levied at 1% of AGR as it is “mainly providing services for strategic purposes. ”Trai has now refused to accept this suggestion and has rather said that it will be discriminatory for other new entrants to the satellite sector who may also provide services similar to what BSNL is providing today.“… the Authority does not agree with the DoT’s view that for Global Satellite Phone Service or GSPS license of BSNL, spectrum charges may continue to be levied at 1% of AGR,” the regulator said, a view that is not being seen favourably by top officials at DoT.Trai said it will be “unfair and unreasonable” to seek 1% AGR charge for BSNL just on the premise that it is providing services for strategic purposes. “DoT’s proposal provides for lesser spectrum charges to a specific service provider i.e. BSNL, a PSU which would be discriminatory in the scenario of multiple service providers for MSS (Mobile Satellite Service).”It also raised objections to the grounds of “strategic purposes” being ascribed just to BSNL. It said that other telecom service providers may also provide services for strategic use, besides commercial use. “However, presently there is no scheme for differential charging of lesser spectrum charges across services and across service providers for providing services for strategic purposes. On this count also such a preferential treatment would be discriminatory. ”Trai said that the 1% spectrum charge for BSNL’s satellite services had been recommended in December 2018 under ‘sui-generis’ category as there was only one single operator then. “Global Satellite Phone Service was majorly being used by the govt agencies and that was the only way to avail telecom connectivity in far-flung areas and water bodies. At that time, this service was not considered as a premium service but was akin to emergency services. ”However, in May 2022, DoT had given orders to expand the scope of the ‘sui-generis’ license granted to BSNL for satellite-based services to provide satellite-based data connectivity to IoT devices/ aggregator devices.Trai says that the industry’s dynamics have changed since. “… significant developments have taken place in the Indian telecom landscape, evolving satellite service technologies and changing market dynamics.”It said that in its reference on satellite communication of July 2024, DoT had itself asked Trai to account for “level playing field” with terrestrial access services for GSO/ NGSO-based Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) providing voice, text, data, and internet services (besides NGSO based Fixed Satellite Services).",The standoff between the department of telecom (DoT) and regulator Trai regarding recommendations for satellite spectrum is intensifying. The latter now raises objections to lower charges being sought for state-owned BSNL’s services.

NEW DELHI: President Draupadi Murmu on Sunday emphasised the need to use electricity wisely and efficiently and said it not only leads to energy conservation but also reduces carbon emissions Speaking at the National Energy Conservation Awards 2025 at the capital’s Vigyan Bhawan, the President said that energy conservation was not just an option but was crucial for a balanced ecosystem. She said that every unit of energy saved was a symbol of responsibility towards nature, and behavioural change was crucial for bringing energy efficiency to all sectors.“Saving energy doesn't simply mean using less, but rather utilising energy wisely, responsibly, and efficiently. When we avoid unnecessary use of electrical appliances, adopt energy-efficient devices, utilise natural light and ventilation in our homes and workplaces, or embrace solar and renewable energy options, we not only save energy but also reduce carbon emissions,” President Murmu said. She added that sustainable development of the country can be ensured if the youth and children make necessary efforts for energy conservation and that saving energy was equivalent to producing energy.The President also appreciated the Centre’s initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy in the form of the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana and the National Green Hydrogen Mission, and said they helped in reducing dependence on fossil fuels.She noted that India's energy efficiency efforts in 2023–24 resulted in energy savings of 53.60 million tonnes of oil equivalent. She said that these efforts are leading to significant economic savings annually and have also resulted in a substantial reduction in CO₂ emissions. The President added that the government was also promoting renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency through the renewable consumption obligation and production-linked incentive schemes.She also gave away awards for energy conservation and the national painting competition on energy conservation at the event.Union power minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that India had positioned itself at the forefront of the global energy shift by aligning its plans with the goal of limiting the increase in worldwide temperatures to below two degrees Celsius.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

Upset FOIs:

Hindon flights cut:

Asaka's ambition:

NEW DELHI: The panel of eight flight operations inspectors (FOIs) created by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to oversee IndiGo operations till the same stabilise are learnt to have identified certain chinks in the airline’s armour.An expat top management person (not CEO) is under the scanned and some regulatory action against him is likely. The operations control centre (OCC) has found to be a weak link. As of now, the airline is giving out two-day rosters to pilots. This means a pilot knows the flights he or she is supposed to fly next two days only.“This two-day roster will continue till the collapsed OCC system is revived. The task has got tougher with low visibility setting in. Now it is not about finding pilots to operate flights but also ensuring pilots trained for low visibility operations are rostered for the early morning and late night flights in airports that will see fog, like Delhi, Amritsar and Lucknow,” said people in the know.Apart from troubles with IndiGo, aviation authorities are facing another problem: The FOIs are upset at the recent removal of four of their colleagues from their position for allegedly not being able to prevent IndiGo’s fiasco.“FOIs feel they have been made the scapegoats. Some of them now want to quit their positions,” said sources.The DGCA is still trying to prevent more hardships for passengers as low visibility has set it. Two IndiGo flights — Ahmedabad-Hindon & Hindon-Varanasi — have been cancelled. “It was better to have the flights cancelled so that passengers know in advance,” said sources.Even before these latest cuts, flights to and from Hindon Airport had been slashed by half this winter. While the IAF enclave used to handle 25 arrivals and as many departures in summer, the number has dropped to 12 arrivals and as many departures. Now two more IndiGo flights have been cancelled till February.“Hindon has certain restrictions for commercial flights like the operations are from sunrise to sunset and there are two parking bays for them. The reduced visibility has made the operation window even shorter. IndiGo has cancelled two flights,” said an airport official.After Air India, Akasa has also asked the government how long will IndiGo capacity cuts continue so that it can decide on operating some extra flights in the second half of January by when the 31st aircraft it has inducted in its fleet will start flying. The aviation ministry is expected to finalise IndiGo cuts and duration of the same early this week. Air India has offered to explore operating 275 extra flights this month.The 30 Boeing 737s Akasa has in its fleet are being fully utilised. The airlines recently got its 31st aircraft which will start flying next month. The airline is learnt to be able to operate this to partially fill in the void created by IndiGo’s route cuts only in the second fortnight of Jan, and not Feb. “IndiGo flight cut void can at best be filled partially and that too temporarily. AI, AI Express & Akasa resources are nearly fully deployed. AI may have 275 additional flights this month.

Chinese soybean purchases lag behind expectations





Aid offers relief, not security

New scrutiny on food supply chain pricing

US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a $12 billion relief package for American farmers, aiming to soften the financial blow of the ongoing trade war with China, which has driven up production costs and slashed crop sales. The announcement was made at the White House during a roundtable meeting attended by agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins, lawmakers from key farming states, and growers grappling with tariff-induced market losses.Farmers who attended the meeting told Trump that they see the relief as a crucial lifeline.“With this bridge payment, we’ll be able to farm another year,” Iowa farmer Cordt Holub said as the president unveiled the plan.Rollins said the aid includes $11 billion earmarked for one-time payments to row-crop producers, and an additional $1 billion reserved for specialty crop support while officials study the specific pressures on those farmers. She said the money should start reaching growers before the end of February.Trump said tariff revenue will supply the funds, adding, “We looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,” AP cited.A USDA formula based on estimated production costs is set to determine payments later this month, with compensation calculated per acre and capped at $155,000 per farm or individual. The programme excludes anyone earning more than $900,000 a year, a limit that will block the largest commercial farms from receiving the biggest payouts, an issue that drew criticism during Trump’s first term.The political stakes are high. Farmers have been among Trump’s core supporters, yet the volatility of his tariff decisions and the effect on agricultural markets have fuelled frustration. The White House has positioned this latest package as part of its defence of Trump’s handling of the broader economy. He is scheduled to travel to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to speak about affordability, an issue that has increasingly shaped voter concerns.Soybeans and sorghum have suffered the largest blow from the trade conflict because more than half of their annual production normally goes overseas, predominantly to China. Following a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had pledged to purchase at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans by the year’s end and 25 million metric tonnes annually for the next three years. China already holds the title of the world’s biggest soybean buyer, though it has been expanding its procurement from Brazil and other South American exporters.Since Trump announced the agreement at the end of October, China has purchased just over 2.8 million metric tonnes, around a quarter of the volume administration officials originally said would be bought. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has insisted China is still on pace to meet the target, though not until the end of February, two months later than the White House first signalled.The scale of the $12 billion aid package is roughly equivalent to the total value of US soybean exports to China in 2024, and about half of all US agricultural exports to China that year.Farmers say the government support is welcome but emphasise that it cannot resolve the core structural challenge of soaring costs and unpredictable markets. Trump authorised more than $22 billion in farming aid in 2019 at the start of the trade dispute and nearly $46 billion in 2020, though that total included pandemic-related assistance.“That’s a start, but I think we need to be looking for some avenues to find other funding opportunities and we need to get our markets going. That’s where we want to be able to make a living from,” Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky grower and president of the American Soybean Association told AP.Farmers who rent most of the land they work are in the most vulnerable position because they lack equity to borrow against. The risk is that, if smaller producers cannot stay afloat this year, consolidation within the industry could intensify.Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt owns only 160 of the 2,000 acres he cultivates and has begun selling non-essential machinery and considering overnight trucking work to generate more income. “It is to the point where I don’t want to saddle my kid with the kind of stress that my wife and I are under right now,” he said.Others remain hopeful that most farms will endure. Minnesota farmer Darin Johnson, whose family operation stretches back four generations, said, “A lot of farms are pretty well-established and they have the equity to be able to still keep borrowing money to get through tougher times like this.”Trump is also facing mounting pressure to act on surging beef prices. He has publicly accused foreign-owned meat packers of artificially inflating prices and has asked the Department of Justice to investigate, although he has not supplied evidence to support his claims.On Saturday, he signed an executive order authorising the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to examine “anti-competitive behaviour” in food supply chains, including fertiliser, seed and equipment, and to consider enforcement or regulatory action where needed.","US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a $12 billion relief package for American farmers, aiming to soften the financial blow of the ongoing trade war with China.

How Triple H and Stephanie McMahon accumulated long-term financial strength through wrestling, leadership and corporate expansion

Why their legacy still guides WWE’s future identity

As members of the WWE corporate leadership team and creative team members, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon are important to both the WWE corporate and creative ecosystems. The estimated net worth of Triple H is approximately $250 million, while the estimated net worth of Stephanie McMahon is approximately $250 million.Therefore, the combined estimated value of both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in 2025 will be approximately $500 million based on the long-term growth of their respective equity interests, as well as the decades they have each spent with WWE.Triple H’s career rarely moved in a straight line, because his shift from performer to executive created a layered income structure through royalties, contract earnings and high-ranking corporate roles. His long involvement in creative planning continues to generate value as global media rights expand and the talent pipelines he built remain central to WWE’s structure.Stephanie McMahon followed a different path, leading branding initiatives that led to other sources of income, community programmes and global partnerships while earning multi-million-dollar compensation packages across several executive cycles.WWE's merger with Endeavor has provided additional value for its shareholdings as a result of increased activity in the marketplace and the evolution of entertainment entities to include more entertainment-based revenue streams.Due to this growth, WWE and Endeavor's financial momentum have developed over time as a result of the company being able to create global brands and have a consistent presence in the evolution of WWE from within its Entertainment Model.Through WWE Television and Digital showcases, Triple H's fingerprints remain very evident. Many of the strategies that he created while heading up NXT are still being utilized in the creation of talent presentation, match structure, and long-term development of characters for the roster of talent on the main roster.The vision of talent recruitment created by Stephanie McMahon will shape the future stories of multiple main event talents, providing WWE with a solid foundation for character development and storytelling. The previous work of Stephanie McMahon will continue to strengthen WWE's public image and brand as a result of the partnerships, digital initiatives and outreach programs she helped create before transitioning out of day-to-day responsibilities.The combination of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon is now being viewed as a creative foundation and business guideline for the future growth of WWE under TKO and the ongoing economic security that both Stephanie McMahon and Triple H represent.Also Read: WWE in big trouble?

Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Paige's sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role. Based on Paige's salary history, limited public records, and the absence of additional disclosed income streams, Shiver’s estimated net worth likely falls in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.As online rumors intensified, Shiver reportedly “switched her Instagram account to private,” a move that social media users interpreted as a sign of the pressure surrounding her. Yet there is no confirmed link between the pay hike and the university’s investigation, and officials have not named her in any formal capacity. Still, the scrutiny grew louder as Sherrone Moore’s professional downfall accelerated.Sherrone Moore, who became a rising coaching star after stepping in during Jim Harbaugh’s suspension and later leading Michigan to major wins, was abruptly dismissed after allegations surfaced of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.“Ex-Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was detained by police in Saline, Mich. this evening and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges,” according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel via Dan Wetzel..With Biff Poggi appointed interim head coach and speculation swirling around the future of the Wolverines’ program, Paige Shiver’s name remains tied to one of the most chaotic weeks in Michigan football history, even as the facts remain unsettled and the investigation ongoing.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige Shiver is an executive assistant at the University of Michigan.

NEW DELHI: As the AQI climbed to alarmingly severe levels on Sunday across the city, at Wazirpur it maxed out at 500.But Wazirpur was not the only station to score the shameful 500. Stations in neighbouring Rohini and Ashok Vihar, too, maxed out.In Rohini, the scale read 499 for over 20 hours. It touched 500 at 6 pm. At Ashok Vihar, the AQI touched 490 at 9 pm on Saturday and remained above this level all of Sunday, and then reached 500.Central Pollution Control Board data shows that multiple locations recorded AQI levels above 490 for prolonged periods.Many areas across the city started seeing hazardous air quality readings from Saturday evening onwards. Of the total 39 active stations across Delhi, 38 were in the severe range. Only Shadipur got a very poor AQI reading at 375. AQI hovered above 490 at 13 stations for several hours, even reaching near the extreme end at many places.Nehru Nagar station in Lajpat Nagar, which saw the AQI rise to 493, got an hourly PM2.5 reading of 720 micrograms per cubic metre on Saturday at 11 pm. It was 12 times higher than the daily national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.It was also 48 times higher than WHO's daily safe guideline of 15 micrograms per cubic metre.Things were no different in other parts of the city. At RK Puram, the peak hourly PM2.5 concentration reached 660 micrograms per cubic metre, and settled at 651 micrograms per cubic metre at Anand Vihar, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee's data.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at think tank Envirocatalysts, said PM2.5 concentration above 5 micrograms per cubic metre on long-term exposure is associated with adverse health impacts, as proven by scientific evidence globally.""What we are breathing currently is PM2.5 levels above 500 micrograms per cubic metre. It is not just a cause of long-term health impacts such as respiratory diseases, COPD, lung cancer, etc., and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, heart failure, but also results in emergency hospitalisation due to asthma attacks and stroke,"" Dahiya said.Among the worst impacted areas in the city were Jahangirpuri (499), Mundka (499), Bawana (498), Delhi Technical University (497), Vivek Vihar (497), Narela (493), IHBAS in Dilshad Garden (491), and Okhla Phase-2 (490).Last winter, the AQI at 15 stations had maxed out at 500 on Nov 18, 2024, when Delhi recorded the second-highest AQI ever at 494. Similarly, RK Puram touched a maximum of 500 on Nov 3, 2023, along with several stations reaching close to the extreme end.Dahiya said it is the failure to adopt source-wise and geographically segregated emission load reduction-based targets with fixed timelines and accountability that is manifesting in such high pollution levels.""If we have to solve the crisis, we need to revamp the existing air pollution regulation and governance framework,"" Dahiya added.MP George, the former additional director of Delhi Pollution Control Committee, said, ""In India, AQI is measured on a scale of 0-500 considering eight pollutants, and a minimum of one particulate matter and two gases are required for calculating the index. AQI levels are shown through different colours, and an AQI above 400 is severe. However, in other countries, the AQI scale and cut-off points for various categories like good or satisfactory are different.

CHANDIGARH: A legal battle that began when India was still finding its feet as a young nation has finally drawn to a close. With Punjab and Haryana HC bringing finality to one of the region’s longest-running property disputes, affirming rights of the original allottee against a private developer, 5,103 sqft land bought for less than Rs 14,000 in Faridabad district 62 years ago will now be handed over at a nominal extra cost of 25% where the current market rate is close to Rs 7 crore. The lone heir to this property, C K Anand, is over 80 years old.“A party that has deferred performance for decades cannot invoke market escalation as a shield,” the bench of Justice Deepak Gupta said in the recent order.The case traces its origins to 1963, when M/s RC Sood & Company Ltd launched Eros Gardens residential colony near Suraj Kund in Faridabad and accepted advance payments from buyer Nanki Devi, Anand’s mother. It agreed to sell two plots — No 26-A, measuring 350 sq yards, and No B-57, measuring 217 sq yards, at Rs 24 and Rs 25 per square yard — to the allottee.Nanka Devi paid nearly half of the sale consideration. But what followed was a saga of statutory roadblocks, administrative delays, and relentless litigation stretching across generationsShortly after the bookings, Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Act, 1963, came into force, followed by Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975.The developer repeatedly cited these laws as reasons for not handing over possession, assuring buyers that once approvals were secured, the plots would be transferred.By the mid-1980s, apprehensive the plots might be sold to third parties, the allottees approached court — not for possession but merely to prevent alienation. Even then, HC held that allotments subsisted and could not be cancelled unilaterally by the company. Still, possession remained elusive.The present round of litigation began in 2002. Lower courts ruled in their favour but the developer moved HC, arguing limitation, alleged cancellation in 1964, and the inequity of enforcing a six-decade-old bargain in today’s real estate market. Justice Gupta, in a 22-page judgment that was released Saturday, rejected each of these arguments.","The case traces its origins to 1963, when M/s RC Sood & Company Ltd launched Eros Gardens residential colony near Suraj Kund in Faridabad.

Woman Claims Brutal Assault At Goa's Romeo Lane As Owner Luthra Brothers Face Heat Over Fire Tragedy

The Times of India

NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Bangkok is in close coordination with Thai authorities following the detention of Goa nightclub owners Saurabh Luthra and Gaurav Luthra in Phuket, sources said to news agency ANI.The duo, owners of the now-charred nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane in Goa’s Arpora, are currently in Thai custody and are being processed for deportation to India in accordance with local laws.A team from the Central Bureau of Investigation arrived in Phuket on Saturday to complete formalities related to the brothers’ return.The Indian embassy is issuing emergency certificates, one-way travel documents to facilitate their deportation after their Indian passports were suspended by the Union government, officials confirmed.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant toldthat the investigative team had reached Thailand and that the process to bring the Luthra brothers back was underway. Goa DGP Alok Kumar also said the duo was expected to be in India next week.The Luthra brothers were detained by Thai authorities last week after it emerged that they were staying in the country illegally. They had fled India just hours after a massive fire broke out at their nightclub in Arpora on the night of December 6, even as police and fire personnel were still battling the blaze and rescuing trapped patrons.Following their departure, the regional passport office in New Delhi issued notices to both brothers, seeking explanations on why action should not be initiated to impound their passports. Soon after a lookout notice was issued, the Ministry of External Affairs moved to suspend their travel documents, rendering their stay in Thailand unlawful and prompting local authorities to detain them.India and Thailand have a formal extradition treaty, signed in 2013 and in force since June 29, 2015. While the current process involves deportation rather than extradition, officials said the treaty provides a robust legal framework for cooperation in such cases.Meanwhile, the Goa police investigation into the devastating fire at Birch by Romeo Lane has revealed glaring regulatory lapses.Investigators found that the nightclub had been operating illegally for nearly 18 months without mandatory permissions and on an expired licence. A senior officer involved in the probe said the licence had not been renewed because the establishment failed to obtain required clearances since 2024.So far, several arrests have been made in connection with the case. These include Gurgaon resident Ajay Gupta (55), a business partner of the Luthra brothers; New Delhi natives Rajiv Modak (49), the club’s chief general manager, and Priyanshu Thakur (32), the gate manager; Uttar Pradesh natives Rajveer Singhania (32), bar manager, and Vivek Singh (27), general manager; and Delhi-based Bharat Kohli.According to police, more than 150 tourists were inside the nightclub when the fire broke out around 11.45 pm during a weekend event. A preliminary probe by the police and the directorate of fire services concluded that electric firecrackers used during the event struck the wooden ceiling, triggering the blaze that rapidly engulfed the premises and claimed 25 lives.Goa police continue to record statements of government officials, fire department personnel and others as the investigation widens, even as efforts intensify to bring the main accused back to India to face criminal proceedings.","The Indian Embassy in Bangkok is in close coordination with Thai authorities following the detention of Goa nightclub owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra.

LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday launched a major crackdown across three states—Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Gujarat—hours after registering an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against 67 accused in the state’s largest codeine-based cough syrup diversion and trafficking racket.Acting on the ECIR filed by its Lucknow zonal office, ED teams, accompanied by central paramilitary forces, carried out coordinated searches at 25 locations. The raids spanned factories, warehouses, and residences linked to arrested accused and their associates.In Uttar Pradesh, premises in Lucknow, Saharanpur, Varanasi, and Ghaziabad were searched, while parallel operations were executed in Ranchi (Jharkhand) and Ahmedabad (Gujarat)—regions identified as hubs for the illegal manufacturing, bottling, and diversion of codeine-based syrups.Officials said the money-laundering probe marks the beginning of a full-fledged financial investigation into the racket, which allegedly generated crores through illegal sale, forged stock entries, fake billing, and benami distribution chains. The ECIR, ED’s internal equivalent of an FIR, empowers the agency to summon suspects, freeze bank accounts, seize digital evidence, and attach properties acquired through illicit proceeds.Sources said the ECIR is based on 24 FIRs registered over the past year by UP Police, STF, and FSDA across districts including Lucknow, Chandauli, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Sonbhadra, Sultanpur, Kanpur Nagar, Jaunpur, Bahraich, Bhadohi, and Ghazipur. These cases involve large-scale seizures of illegal or mislabelled codeine syrups, fake GST invoices, manipulated stock registers, unregistered transporters, and suspected covert manufacturing units.“Diversion of pharmaceutical consignments to unlicensed markets and cash-based interstate networks indicated layered laundering,” an official said. Investigators have also flagged the use of shell firms, informal cash channels, and benami entities.ED has sought complete case files, bank statements, GST records, ITRs, and property documents of all accused from UP Police, and has begun mapping the financial and logistical chain—transporters, warehouses, pharma distributors, and cash handlers.The alleged kingpin, Shubham Jaiswal, was issued a notice to appear before ED in Lucknow on December 8, 2025. But he did not now. More summonses are expected as the financial probe widens.“This case involves diversion of pharmaceutical stock, illegal manufacturing, smuggling routes, and laundering of profits. The financial network is as critical as the criminal one,” an officer said.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday launched a major crackdown across three states.

Months-long hunt ends: Leopard roaming Pune airport finally captured,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/months-long-hunt-ends-leopard-roaming-pune-airport-finally-captured/articleshow/125927981.cms,"PUNE: After months of remaining elusive, the fully grown male leopard, which was sighted multiple times at the Pune airport since April this year, was finally caught in the wee hours of Friday by a joint team of forest department and RESQCT members.Forest officials said that the carefully planned operation was assisted by the personnel of the Indian Air Force (IAF). The leopard had been moving on the airside of the airport which is managed and maintained by the IAF.The presence of the leopard was first confirmed on April 28. Over the following months, the animal utilised an extensive network of underground tunnels, dense vegetation and low-footfall zones within the airport premises to move in and out of the area. Given the vast and sensitive nature of the airport landscape, capture efforts posed significant operational and safety challenges. Continuous monitoring was undertaken using camera traps, live cameras and trap cages, though the leopard consistently avoided entering cages.On December 4, monitoring confirmed that the leopard had entered the underground tunnel network. In response, tunnel exits were systematically closed and reinforced, additional live surveillance cameras were installed, and camera traps were repositioned to closely track the animal’s movement patterns within the confined space, officials said.Based on this data, a focused operation was planned on 11 December 2025 involving a 30-member team comprising personnel from the Forest Department, RESQ Charitable Trust and the Indian Air Force. The team executed a coordinated drive to guide the leopard into an approximately 80-foot tunnel, where a controlled chemical immobilisation could be attempted.Despite the highly constrained conditions underground, the leopard was successfully tranquilised by wildlife veterinarian Dr Gourav Mangla. The animal was then safely retrieved from the tunnel and transferred for veterinary observation.The leopard has since recovered well and is currently housed at the Transit Treatment Centre at Bavdhan, Pune, for further observation and assessment.Mahadev Mohite, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Pune Division, said, “This operation reflects strong inter-agency coordination and preparedness. The Forest Department, RESQ Charitable Trust, the Indian Air Force and airport authorities worked seamlessly over several months. Pune has demonstrated that it is equipped to respond to complex wildlife situations within highly sensitive urban and infrastructure settings. ”Neha Panchamiya, Founder and President, RESQ Charitable Trust, added, “Every wildlife capture situation is unique, and responses must be guided by strategy, timing and context rather than urgency alone. This operation shows that wise, measured decision-making, supported by data, technology and teamwork, leads to outcomes that prioritise both human safety and wildlife welfare.”","The presence of the leopard was first confirmed on April 28.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) laid off 376 employees from its Pune campus.

"Nvidia responds to report claiming China's DeepSeek that wiped billions from US stock market in January 2025, is using 'banned' Nvidia chips",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-responds-to-report-claiming-chinas-deepseek-that-wiped-billions-from-us-stock-market-in-january-2025-is-using-banned-nvidia-chips/articleshow/125970647.cms,"Market impact of DeepSeek

Nvidia’s chips important for AI boom

“I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security.

President Xi responded positively! $25% will be paid to the United States of America. This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers.

The Biden Administration forced our Great Companies to spend BILLIONS OF DOLLARS building “degraded” products that nobody wanted, a terrible idea that slowed Innovation, and hurt the American Worker. That Era is OVER! We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI. NVIDIA’s U.S. Customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal. My Administration will always put America FIRST. The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, and the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel, and other GREAT American Companies. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,” Wrote Trump.





Nvidia has now pushed back against a report claiming that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, whose breakthrough earlier this year rattled US markets, is secretly using its restricted Blackwell AI chips. Recently, a report published by The Information alleged that DeepSeek has acquired smuggled Blackwell GPUs which the company is using to train its upcoming AI model. These chips are among Nvidia’s most-advanced processors and they have been named from export to China under US trade restrictions which are aimed at maintaining America’s lead in the artificial intelligence race. However, the chipset major has dismissed these claims.“We haven’t seen any substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom data centers’ constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled and reconstructed somewhere else,” an Nvidia spokesperson said told CNBC. “While such smuggling seems far-fetched, we pursue any tip we receive.”The US has banned the export of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, which are considered the company’s most advanced offerings, to China as part of its strategy to maintain a lead in the global AI race.DeepSeek stunned global tech sector with its launched in January 2025, when the company released its R1 model. Analysts noted that R1 was built at a fraction of the cost of U.S. competitors, sparking fears of China’s rapid progress in AI and contributing to a sell-off that wiped billions from US stock markets. In August, DeepSeek hinted that China would soon have its own “next generation” chips to support AI models, raising further concerns about how the country might circumvent US restrictions.Nvidia’s Blackwell chips play an important part in the AI boom. The chips are designed to power everything from large language models to advanced data centres. Their role has made Nvidia’s relationship with China a political flashpoint in Washington.Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that Nvidia could ship its H200 chips to “approved customers” in China and elsewhere, provided the U.S. government receives 25% of those sales. The move drew criticism from some lawmakers, highlighting the tension between commercial interests and national security.In the post, Trump wrote that he has informed Chinese President Xi Jinping that the US would allow sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips under a framework which is designed to benefit American workers and tax payers.","The US has banned the export of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips to China as part of its strategy to maintain a lead in the global AI race.

Rupee continued its downward rally on Monday, falling to an all-time low of 90.58 against the US dollar. This dip marks second week of record lows after the currency fell to 90.55 against USD earlier, on Friday.The currency is struggling with familiar headwinds, weighed down by delays in a US trade deal, persistently weak capital flows, and a widening trade deficit. Experts have pointed to a mix of factors driving its decline, including strong corporate demand for dollars and steep US tariffs of 50% on Indian exports.This year alone, the currency has slipped over 5% against the US dollar, making it the third-worst performer among 31 major global currencies, behind only the Turkish lira and Argentina’s peso. This decline comes even as the dollar index has eased by more than 7%.Crossing the 90 mark is particularly significant, as it represents half of the rupee’s value in 2011. Analysts say that this milestone adds pressure on RBI governor Sajay Malhotra, who must carefully balance currency flexibility with overall market stability.In recent months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has often intervened to slow down rupee’s slide. However, its support has appeared less forceful since the currency weakened past the 88.80 level and surpassing the 90 per dollar mark.The RBI remains a key player in the rupee’s international trading, including through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) settled in dollars. Its interventions are executed through the Bank for International Settlements, in coordination with select major banks across trading hubs such as Singapore, Dubai, and London.","Rupee continues its downward rally, falling to an all-time low of 90.58 against the US dollar.

SBI Life is expected to sustain steady operating performance with strong growth in Annual Premium Equivalent (APE) and Value of New Business (VNB), supported by a favorable product mix shift toward protection and non-par offerings. VNB margin improved to 27.9% in Q2FY26, even after a 70–80bp drag from the GST-related input tax credit loss in 1HFY26.Momentum remains robust in high-margin categories, with individual protection rising 24% YoY and non-par savings and annuity segments growing 40–50%. Persistency has strengthened, and assets under management increased 10% YoY to ₹4.8tn, reinforcing long-term earnings potential.Management maintains confidence in achieving 13–14% individual APE growth for FY26 and reiterates its 26–28% VNB margin outlook, expecting product mix improvements, higher rider penetration, and cost efficiencies to offset GST-related pressures. Structural shifts toward protection, non-par products, and digital sourcing continue to support sustained value creation.RBL Bank’s growth prospects improve meaningfully with Emirates NBD’s proposed USD3 billion investment, giving ENBD a 60% promoter stake that will rise to 62% once its India branches merge with the bank. The infusion strengthens RBK’s net worth and brings a highly profitable global partner with strong capabilities in funding, corporate banking, remittances, treasury, and risk management.Operational metrics are trending positively, with margins, asset quality, and profitability improving on the back of better liability management and a more balanced asset mix. Growth remains solid as the bank deliberately slows unsecured lending and scales secured products including MSME, gold loans, SME and mid-corporate, tractors, affordable housing, and secured business loans. With easing macro pressures, a more secure loan book, ENBD’s expertise, and rising operating leverage, RBL is positioned for stronger, more diversified, and more profitable expansion.","Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting December 15, 2025) are SBI Life and RBL Bank.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Additionally, HSBC's Flash Composite, Manufacturing, and Services PMI readings will be monitored for economic trends towards the year's conclusion.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The general expectation in the market is that India’s underperformance in 2025 is likely to be compensated in 2026. India’s macros are in fine shape and policy support has been strong. The fiscal and monetary stimuli imparted to trigger consumption and investment has started yielding results. If the momentum sustains it can give the much needed boost to corporate earnings in FY27. ”“A major drag on the market continues to be the elusive US-India trade deal which is impacting India’s exports to the US, widening of trade deficit and continuous depreciation in the rupee.On the global market front, a likely scenario is the weakening of the AI trade. Recent AI results in the US indicate earnings stress in some AI companies. If the AI trade weakens, that will be beneficial to India. In brief, the macro construct favours outperformance by India in the EM universe in 2026. But the high market valuations should temper expectations.”The S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped over 1% on Friday as investors moved away from technology shares. Concerns about AI valuation sparked by Broadcom and Oracle, coupled with rising US Treasury yields following policymakers' resistance to monetary easing, affected market sentiment.Asian equities declined early Monday as investors showed caution ahead of central bank meetings and significant data releases this week.On Friday, foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 1,114 crore.

The move marks a significant shift in the country’s approach to real estate, offering opportunities for investment while maintaining clear regulatory oversight.Saudi Gazette reported that, the Minister of Municipalities and Housing Majed Al-Hogail confirmed that the updated system will allow foreigners to own residential property in most Saudi cities, marking a significant shift from previous restrictions.Residential ownership by foreigners will be permitted across the Kingdom, with four notable exceptions:While these cities are excluded from general residential ownership, authorities may later designate specific zones within them where non-residents can own property, subject to approval.For non-Saudi residents living in the Kingdom, the law allows ownership of one residential unit outside designated ownership zones.This applies nationwide, except in Makkah and Madinah, where residential ownership remains restricted to Muslims only.Non-residents, on the other hand, will be allowed to own property only in areas specifically designated and approved by authorities.In contrast to residential rules, the framework takes a more expansive approach to business related property.Foreigners will be allowed to own:This access will apply in all Saudi cities without exception, signaling a clear intent to encourage foreign investment, industrial growth, and agricultural development throughout the Kingdom.The updated system is designed to regulate foreign ownership by setting clear geographic boundaries, ownership limits, and legal controls. Non-Saudis can own property or acquire real estate rights only in areas designated by the Council of Ministers. These designations are based on recommendations from the Real Estate General Authority and approved by the Council of Economic and Development Affairs.Authorities will define the types of real estate rights allowed, the maximum ownership ratios, and all related conditions. The framework ensures that foreign ownership does not grant additional privileges beyond those defined by law and does not affect rights under other programs such as the Premium Residency Program or agreements with Gulf Cooperation Council countries.All non-Saudi individuals and entities must register with the relevant authorities. Ownership will only be legally recognized once it is recorded in the Real Estate Registry. A transaction fee of up to 5% of the property value will apply to foreign ownership, with details to be specified in the executive regulations.Violations of the law may result in fines or warnings, while providing false information can lead to fines of up to SR10 million and, in certain cases, a court ordered sale of the property.Through these measures, Saudi Arabia aims to open its real estate market to foreign nationals while ensuring transparency, regulatory clarity, and controlled growth across both residential and commercial sectors.","Starting 2026, foreigners can own Saudi property, excluding Makkah, Madinah, Jeddah, and Riyadh cities. The move marks a significant shift in the country’s approach to real estate, offering opportunities for investment while maintaining clear regulatory oversight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125970882,imgsize-992495,width-400,resizemode-4/saudi.jpg"
