The nuclear engineer who chose the fields: Randip’s journey from special forces to Stanford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-nuclear-engineer-who-chose-the-fields-randips-journey-from-special-forces-to-stanford/articleshow/121741324.cms,"Randip Singh

At 19, Randip Singh stood in an Amtrak station in Albany, NY when a police officer approached him with an unusual request: “Can I see your passport?” He didn’t ask for a driver's license, but a passport. The implication was clear.Years later, Singh would find himself 300 meters away from a 250kg Russian bomb that left a crater the size of a house in the Syrian desert. The shockwave that followed lifted the entire landscape toward him, like something out of a movie.Between these two moments lies a story that eludes categorization: a nuclear engineer who abandoned a promising corporate career to spend 11 years in the Army , including multiple deployments as a Special Forces medic in Iraq and Syria. Now, sitting in Stanford's Graduate School of Business, Singh represents something increasingly rare: someone who chose the hardest possible path to find belonging.“I believe in things enough to give my life for them. That's why I liked the Army; there are people there who believe in causes,” Singh says matter-of-factly during our conversation.Singh's journey began with displacement. Born in America but raised in India after his parents divorced, he experienced what he calls “the outsider view” from an early age.This perspective shaped him through boarding school, through his nuclear engineering studies at RPI in New York, and eventually through his time at General Electric, which he ultimately chose to leave.Singh’s deeper issue was belonging. Despite being born American, Singh felt like an outsider in his own country. The Amtrak incident wasn't isolated; he endured comments like “Hey, Osama, go back to your home”.“When you’re younger, you think that's gonna solve something,” he reflects on his decision to enlist. “I thought serving would create belonging, not because I’m some patriot, but purely from my internal motivation of feeling like I belong in this country.”Singh didn't just join the Army; instead, he sought out its most demanding roles. He became a Special Forces medic, a position that required learning trauma medicine in one year – something that takes more than 5 – while maintaining the physical and mental standards of elite warfare.""They basically combine what an ER surgeon does into one year, along with some dentistry, veterinarian medicine, and internal medicine,"" he explains. ""You learn to do amputations, chest tubes, tooth extractions, and you only get two or three practice attempts. If you can't get it right in three tries, you're done. 70% of people fail.""The training philosophy was brutal but effective. As one Grizzled Green Beret instructor told Singh: “80% of what you do won't affect the outcome of the patient. 20% will build your reputation.""This lesson in accepting what you cannot control would prove crucial when Singh had to make triage decisions in treating victims of an ISIS attack. “Three people died,” Singh recalls, his voice quieting.“There's some amount of fate that you just can't control,” he says. “That was a big insight because until then I had this engineering mindset that I could control everything. Accepting that has made me much happier.”This perspective shapes how he evaluates human potential now. “Most people compare themselves too early to masters,” he observes. “They try to learn golf and immediately compare themselves to Tiger Woods . You discount your own potential because of that.”Instead, Singh values people who can “break problems down and go into insane detail.” In combat, this meant knowing exactly how many meters away a building was, even if it seemed irrelevant. “When someone's life is on the line, I want to know everything.”Perhaps most striking about Singh is his refusal to choose between his Indian and American identities. “I see myself as 100% Indian and 100% American,” he states. “I can choose the good things from both cultures.”This dual identity, forged through displacement and tested in combat, gives him a unique perspective on belonging. The teenager who felt he needed to prove his Americanness through military service now understands that belonging is “your own meditative thing and how you think about it.”At Stanford, Singh is preparing for his next chapter: returning to the energy sector, working on large infrastructure projects. But business school serves a different purpose than mere career preparation.“I lost some confidence in the Army because I was enlisted,” he admits. “I didn't know if I could make strategic decisions. Being here helps me build confidence that yes, I can do that too.”His three core values are autonomy, persistence, and integrity, which were forged through experiences most people never face. His mother’s decision to leave an unsuccessful marriage taught him autonomy. His grandfather’s success as a self-taught machinist to a successful businessman demonstrated persistence. And the Army's unforgiving standards demanded absolute integrity.As he prepares to leave Stanford and return to building infrastructure that powers society, Singh carries with him the hard-won wisdom of someone who chose the most difficult path to find himself. His story challenges comfortable assumptions about patriotism, belonging, and what it means to serve.“I wanted to see a part of human nature you can't see in corporate settings,” he reflects on his Army years. “It's a very raw form of humanity. That experience was worth everything.”In a world increasingly dominated by safe choices and calculated risks, Randip Singh stands as a reminder that sometimes the hardest path leads to the clearest understanding of who you are and what you're capable of.","Randip Singh was born in America but raised in India after his parents divorced. He felt like an outsider in his own country, so he enlisted in the Army. He spent 11 years as a Special Forces medic in Iraq and Syria. Now he is attending Stanford's Graduate School of Business.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121741468,imgsize-26252,width-400,resizemode-4/121741468.jpg"
Indian Judiciary’s commitment to justice transcends borders: Justice Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-judiciarys-commitment-to-justice-transcends-borders-justice-kant/articleshow/121740803.cms,"Justice Surya Kant

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant of Indian Supreme Court on Monday told the Indian business community in Washington that Indian judiciary understood the problems faced by the Indian diaspora and NRIs and played a crucial role in resolving unique challenges faced by them relating to property, inheritance and custody of children in soured matrimonial relations.Speaking with Indian businessmen from various states gathered under the banner of ‘Washington Telangana Association’, Justice Kant said, “With procedural adaptations and a growing recognition of cross-border complexities, the courts have made justice more accessible to those living abroad. In certain areas, the judiciary has also extended the protection of Fundamental Rights, ensuring that non-resident citizens are treated with fairness and equality under the law. ”“In doing so, it reinforces the message that India’s commitment to justice does not end at its borders, it reaches all those who continue to carry the country in their hearts,” he added.Commending the resilience of Indian diaspora to maintain their identity while continuing to participate in the technological innovations, research and community service in the countries they have made home while exploring opportunities, Justice Kant said the Indian identity thrives in our languages and festivals, but also in our collective commitment to justice, dignity, and mutual respect.These are the ideals that shape not just who we are, but who we continue to become, no matter where we live. ”Commending the role played by the Indian diaspora as ambassadors of India’s rich cultural and constitutional legacy by not only preserving it for ourselves but sharing it with the world, the next CJI said, “In doing so, we honour not only our past, but also our enduring responsibility to shape a future that is united in diversity, grounded in justice, and inspired by the very best of who we are.”“The success of the Indian diaspora is not only measured in individual achievement - though that alone is remarkable. It is also reflected in the collective identity that communities have preserved and passed on across generations. Whether through temples, cultural centres, schools, or community events, the diaspora has cultivated a sense of belonging and solidarity, making the Indian identity one that thrives far beyond national borders,” he said.","Justice Surya Kant of Indian Supreme Court told the Indian business community in Washington that Indian judiciary understood the problems faced by the Indian diaspora and NRIs.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:

Strategy: Gold and Silver Buy on dips.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have seen major fluctuations over the last few weeks, ever since the yellow metal prices hit a lifetime high. Gold is seen as a safe haven investment in times of turmoil and uncertainty. The rapidly evolving geopolitical and trade situations have kept gold investors guessing on the direction of gold prices. So, what is the gold rate prediction for this week and what should investors do?Last week, Gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front, driven by a weakening dollar and escalating global uncertainty. Silver posted one the sharpest gains on daily and weekly basis, gaining 2.7% in the previous session, its strongest daily performance in over three weeks, as investors sought refuge amid concerns over the US-China trade deal.The upcoming trade discussions between US and China remains a key event for market direction. The European Commission is also urging the US to reduce tariffs, adding to the broader trade policy uncertainty.Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions intensified with Russia demanding territorial concessions from Ukraine to end the war. On the macro front, weaker-than-expected US manufacturing and services PMI data, coupled with disappointing private payrolls, raised concerns about stagflation.Still, the better-than-expected non-farm payroll data signalled resilience in the labour market, keeping investor sentiment mixed.Silver, after lagging behind gold, saw renewed interest due to improved fundamentals and technical momentum, pushing it to a 13-year high. The Gold/Silver ratio also dropped sharply, signalling silver’s relative strength.ETF inflows into silver added further support, reflecting growing investor appetite for the metal amid continued global economic and political instability. Focus this week will be on US and China CPI data.","Last week, Gold climbed to a near four-week high, while silver surged past ₹1 lakh on the domestic front.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers.

The terms of all state assemblies constituted after this date will expire with the end of that Lok Sabha's five-year term.

The President may issue an order to conduct an election for that assembly at a later date.

For example, a senior official said, even students who obtained less than 50% marks in 10+2 (physics, chemistry, biology) -- a basic criterion -- were granted admission.A senior NMC official highlighted that while granting admission, medical colleges are required to ensure the numbers are not beyond their sanctioned intake capacity. Also, colleges must make sure that students meet eligibility requirements regarding age and qualifying marks.All students admitted to MBBS course are supposed to have cleared NEET-UG with the required percentile: 50th percentile and above for general category, 45th percentile and above for the physically challenged and 40th percentile and above for reserved (SC/ST/OBC) candidates.","The National Medical Commission (NMC) has said that students who got admission in MBBS course in 2024-25 but whose names are missing from its portal may not be eligible for registration to practise medicine. India has approximately 1.18 lakh MBBS seats.

It also said that it had directed banks not to resort to intimidation or harassment of any kind for recovery of loan amounts from buyers.Under the subvention scheme, banks disburse the sanctioned amount directly to the the builders, who then have to pay EMIs on the sanctioned loan amount, until possession of the flats is handed over to homebuyers. As many builders did not complete construction and started defaulting in paying the EMIs to the banks as per the Tripartite Agreement, the banks started action against the buyers to recover the EMIs and it is the SC which came to their rescue by ordering a probe into the alleged 'unholy' nexus of builders and banks.In an affidavit filed in the apex court, RBI referred to various directions and guidelines issued by it from time to time and said, ""RBI has performed its duty in discharge of its statutory obligations under the various statutes, including those under the BR (Banking Regulation) Act.""The regulator said it had way back in 2015 taken cognisance of the practices such as Subvention Schemes and had issued guidelines as per which disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing project and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete or under-construction housing projects.In a relief to many homebuyers who booked flats under subvention plan and have not got possession of their flats because of inordinate delay by developers, SC had in July last year directed that no coercive action could be taken against them by banks or builders regarding payment of EMI and no complaint shall be entertained against them for cheque bounce cases.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Monday said significant milestones were achieved in economic revival, social justice, cultural pride and national security during the 11 years of Narendra Modi government, with the governance focused on farmers, women, backward classes, Dalits and the underprivileged.“In 11 years of seva, the speed and scale of the country’s development have been changed by ‘minimum govt, maximum governance’,” Shah said in a series of posts on X, adding that “the Modi government has proved that when the leadership is clear, the resolve firm and public service the intention, new records of service, security and good governance are created”.Dwelling on the positive change in the security landscape, Shah posted that not only is Naxalism on the wane and peace established in J&K and the northeast, but “India now responds to terrorist attacks by striking the terror perpetrators in their own backyard”.Data relating to incidents in J&K, Maoist violence-hit regions and the northeast, sourced by TOI, substantiates Shah’s statement.

NEW DELHI: All new non-AC local trains for the Mumbai Suburban network will have automatic closing doors, like in metro trains, and the system will be installed in existing rakes subsequently, the Railway Board said after four passengers died and six were injured as they fell from a moving overcrowded local train in Thane on Monday.The first train with the new door system will be ready by Nov, and after required tests and certification, it will be put into service by Jan next year. The design is being finalised by Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory (ICF), top railway officials said.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Railway Board officials had a detailed meeting with the ICF team “to find a practical solution” to the issue, ministry officials said. They added that a major issue with automatic door closing in non-AC trains is reduced ventilation in coaches.“Following detailed discussions, it was decided that new non-AC trains will be designed and manufactured using three design changes — first, the doors will have louvres; second, coaches will have roof-mounted ventilation units to pump in fresh air and third, coaches will have vestibules so that passengers can move from one coach to another and balance out the crowd in a natural way,” an official said.Officials said a few years back, the automatic door closing system on non-AC local trains underwent trials but it impacted operations, leading to delays on the network.Now, there is no other option left but to have the system in all non-AC coaches, they said. “It has to be implemented for the people’s safety and to prevent people travelling on a coach’s footboard,” said an official. Every day, around 80 lakh passengers use local trains for commuting.At present, local trains make around 3,216 trips on the Mumbai Suburban network. There are around 280 non-AC rakes. “In all, around 3,405 coaches have to be retrofitted with the door closing system,” said an official.Officials said 13 projects of 310 km worth Rs 17,000 crore are being executed to augment the capacity of the network, and the railway can add more services to meet the traffic demand when these get completed.","Four passengers died and six were injured as they fell from a moving overcrowded local train in Thane on Monday.

Digital economy has eliminated traditional boundaries

Companies report positive results from flexible schedules

Shark Tank judge and millionaire Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard,"" arguing that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete.Speaking on Fox News, the 70-year-old investor took particular aim at France's exploration of shortened work weeks, suggesting a provocative alternative: ""I think we should let the French go to a two-day workweek and then kick their ass internationally,"" he spoke at a Fox TV show.O'Leary contends that pandemic-era changes have fundamentally altered how work functions. ""There's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic,"" he explained. With 40% of his staff working remotely worldwide, he focuses on project completion rather than hours clocked.""I don't care when my staff does their work—as long as it gets done on time,"" O'Leary said, acknowledging that while he opposes mandated four-day weeks, the traditional 9-to-5 model is equally outdated.Despite O'Leary's skepticism, numerous organizations are seeing benefits from shortened workweeks. Performance coaching company Exos implemented a four-day schedule for its 3,500 employees, resulting in 24% increased productivity and halved burnout rates.The trend has gained executive attention, with 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG survey data. International governments are also experimenting—Tokyo's metropolitan government recently introduced four-day options to address population decline and improve work-life balance .""We must build a society where everyone can balance work and family life, and one step forward is the four-day workweek,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told Fortune.Research supports worker interest, with 77% of employees saying a four-day workweek would favorably impact their wellbeing, even if maintaining 40 total hours, according to Gallup polling.","Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard"" The Shark Tank judge argues that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete. 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121725791,imgsize-1038327,width-400,resizemode-4/Kevin-OLeary.jpg"

BENGALURU: Suspended IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash Monday moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), challenging the govt's order suspending him for dereliction of duty. Vikash is one of the five officers suspended.The suspension order, citing Rule 3(1)(a) of the All India Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1969, alleged that Vikash, along with other officers, failed to take adequate crowd-control and safety measures despite prior knowledge of the celebrations.However, it doesn't specify the exact role, negligence or wilful misconduct attributable to him. The order highlighted the fact there wasn't enough time to prepare for such a huge event, but was silent on how the tragedy could be attributed to Vikash and the other officers.The applicant stated in his application that he has been made a scapegoat.Meanwhile, nearly 30 retired IPS officers have written to chief minister Siddaramaiah, urging him to revoke the suspension of senior police personnel over the June 4 stampede at M Chinnaswamy Stadium. In their open letter, they stressed that punitive action should follow judicial inquiry, not precede it.The officers said the RCB management first announced the victory celebrations on social media, drawing lakhs of fans to the stadium within hours of the IPL final.The hasty celebrations were arranged due to travel plans of RCB's foreign and local players, the letter said.They noted that police had warned the organisers in writing about the risks of holding such a large event on short notice.Calling the suspension of police officers unjust, the letter stated they were made scapegoats while the real accountability lay with RCB, KSCA and the organisers.","Vikash Kumar Vikash moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), challenging the govt's order suspending him for dereliction of duty.

THANE: The lives and dreams of four families were shattered in an instant as their loved ones were killed in Monday's train accident near Mumbra. Commuting to work or heading home after a routine work shift — one travelling to buy his dream home — turned out to be the final stop in the journey of their young lives.The IT engineer's journey to Dombivli, which turned out to be his last one, was meant to secure his future through a property purchase. The Thane resident, who dedicated his life to caring for his 80-year-old mother, worked at a company in Vidyavihar and was heading to meet a property owner about purchasing a flat that would have marked a new chapter in his life. His brother-in-law learned of his plans only after tragedy struck. One of Shah's two married sisters collapsed in shock outside the mortuary upon receiving news of his death.Vicky was headed home to Kalyan after completing his night shift, ironically protecting the very railway system that ultimately claimed his life. He had celebrated his 34th birthday just four days ago on Thursday. The family is from Sindhu apartment in Lokgram, Kalyan (East).Vicky lived with his wife, Deepa (30), and his son, Pranay, who will turn three years old a week later on June 16. As word arrived about his fatal accident, an atmosphere of deep sorrow pervaded his house. His housing society and neighbourhood was enveloped in a pall of gloom.Neighbours said that Deepa received news of her husband's death in the morning, after which she was inconsolable. Since Vicky's parents and younger brother live in their native village in Jalna, the family decided to take his remains there for the last rites.Vicky's neighbour Santosh Agavane described him as an affable person who always met people with a smile. ""He celebrated his own birthday simply at home but was more excited about his son's upcoming birthday,"" he said. Society member Bharat Varghat said that Vicky did many good deeds during his posting in Kalyan GRP before recently getting transferred to Thane, where he even caught a thief.Vicky had secured his job five years ago, after which he started living in Lokgram. Earlier he used to live in a rented apartment and purchased his own home two years ago. A year ago the dutiful householder also got his younger brother married.One of his GRP colleagues remembered him as a ""cooperative and caring"" co-worker. Other GRP employees were heartbroken that the devoted father's life had been cut tragically short.The deceased is survived by his youngest brother and two sisters. His father works as a security guard. Rahul worked as a helper in a stationery shop and handled deliveries. His family members said he was a conscientious son who supported the large family. The tragedy left his father grappling with an unimaginable loss. ""This is a tragic moment for our family,"" he mourned, his words barely capturing the depth of grief that consumed their household. The simple statement masked the profound devastation that tore through yet another family.Ketan Saroj, who boarded the train at Shahad, was standing near the footboard in a less crowded local. Minutes later, a surge of passengers entered at Diva. As they moved through the crowded compartment, their bags brushed against those standing precariously on the footboard. The pressure caused Saroj to lose his balance and fall from the moving train, beginning a desperate struggle for survival that ended in his death at Thane Civil Hospital. Passengers said they pulled the train's emergency chain but that did not stop the moving train. ""What is the use of the chain when it failed to work in an emergency,"" said his friend and co-traveller Deepak Shirsat. By the time Deepak continued to Thane and returned to the accident site, Saroj had already succumbed to his injuries in hospital.Saroj had recently completed his BCom degree and begun working at a BPO in Ashar IT Park. His father, an electrician, said tearfully, ""The incident has shattered me. Most of our household expenses were borne by my son."" He requested govt assistance for his other son's employment.","Mayur Shah (44), Vicky Mukhyadal (34), Ketan Saroj (23) and Rahul Gupta (27) were killed in Monday's train accident near Mumbra.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success. Such resilience has been a major pillar in Nvidia's culture and Huang's own leadership style.Stephen Witt further discloses that Huang is motivated to a large extent by guilt. Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently. Witt clarifies that Huang's motivation is not mere ambition but also a combination of the fear of failure, paranoia among competitors, and the guilt of possibly disappointing others. This generates tremendous internal pressure that Huang leverages as an impetus to remain focused and drive Nvidia to its greatest heights.",Jensen Huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry.

What is the High Seas Treaty

Why is it needed

How the treaty works



What happens when it reaches 60 ratifications

What comes after ratification

BIG! Zelensky To Flee Ukraine Any Moment? ‘Secret Escape Plan’ Out As Russia Advances | Watch





Eighteen countries ratified the High Seas Treaty on Monday, bringing the total to 49 - just 11 short of the 60 needed for the ocean agreement to enter into force. The surge in support, occurring during the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, adds momentum to what could become a historic shift in how the world governs the open ocean.Here's what the treaty is, why it matters and what happens next.Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the High Seas Treaty is the first legally binding agreement focused on protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. These waters, which are beyond the jurisdiction of any single country, make up nearly two-thirds of the ocean and almost half the surface of the planet.Until now, there has been no comprehensive legal framework to create marine protected areas or enforce conservation on the high seas.Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates warn that without proper protections, marine ecosystems in international waters face irreversible harm.""Until now, it has been the wild west on the high seas,"" said Megan Randles, global political lead for oceans at Greenpeace.""Now we have a chance to properly put protections in place.""The treaty is also essential to achieving the global ""30x30"" target - an international pledge to protect 30 per cent of the planet's land and sea by 2030.The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geo-engineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.Crucially, decisions under the treaty will be made multilaterally through conferences of parties (COP) rather than by individual countries acting alone.Once 60 countries ratify the treaty, a 120-day countdown begins before it officially enters into force. That would unlock the ability to begin designating protected areas in the high seas and put oversight mechanisms into motion.As of Monday evening, 49 countries and the EU had ratified, meaning 11 more are needed to trigger that countdown.The first Conference of the Parties (COP1) must take place within one year of the treaty's entry into force. That meeting will lay the groundwork for implementation, including decisions on governance, financing and the creation of key bodies to evaluate marine protection proposals.Environmental groups are pushing to surpass the required 60 ratifications, and to do so quickly - the more countries that ratify, the stronger and more representative the treaty's implementation will be. There's also a deadline: only countries that ratify by COP1 will be eligible to vote on critical decisions that determine how the treaty will operate.""To reach 60 ratifications would be an absolutely enormous achievement, but for the treaty to be as effective as possible, we need countries from all over the world to engage in its implementation,"" said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. ""So the next step will be to go from 60 to global.""The surge in support on Monday has raised hopes that 2025 could mark a turning point for high seas protection.""We're on the brink of making high seas history,"" Hubbard said.","The High Seas Treaty is the first legally binding agreement focused on protecting marine biodiversity in international waters.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "".

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Bengaluru Weekend Property Registration: 800 transactions worth Rs 3 cr on first day of weekend property registration drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/800-transactions-worth-rs-3-cr-on-first-day-of-weekend-property-registration-drive/articleshow/121710248.cms,"Poll Should the government expand the weekend registration initiative to more districts? Yes, absolutely. No, it's enough as is.





Bengaluru: The govt's new weekend property registration initiative kicked off on a promising note with over 800 documents registered across the state on June 1— the first Sunday after the reform was introduced.The initiative, aimed at easing weekday congestion at sub-registrar offices, brought in more than Rs 3 crore in revenue through stamp duty and registration fees on that one day alone. Officials from the department of stamps and registration described the initial response as ""decent"" and ""encouraging"". Some said they are optimistic that participation will increase in coming weeks.""Besides easing weekday rush, the move is aimed at offering flexibility to working individuals,"" said a department official. He said the department is considering launching awareness campaigns to popularise the option.As per the scheme, at least one sub-registrar office in every district will remain open on the second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays of the month.Department data shows around 834 property documents were registered across the state on the opening day, including 60 linked to the farmer registration and unified beneficiary information system (FRUITS).Dharwad district saw the highest number of registrations at 140, followed by Chitradurga with 95 and Bijapur (Vijayapura) with 69. In contrast, the five stamp and registration districts within Bengaluru Urban recorded just 20 registrations in total.There are 35 registration districts in Karnataka, including five within Bengaluru, but on June 1, only 32 districts offered property registration services. No registrations took place in Kodagu, Karwar, and Shivajinagar.P Sunil Kumar, inspector general of registration and commissioner of stamps (IGRCS), highlighted the rationale behind the move. ""The sub-registrar offices working on the second and fourth Saturdays and all Sundays will observe a holiday on the following Tuesday. So, the revenue collection will remain the same. Our main intention is to assist the working class rather than collecting more revenue,"" Kumar said.He also said the department will monitor the scheme over the next few weeks to assess its effectiveness. ""The department may adopt any measures required after the review for the effective implementation of the initiative in the state,"" he added. Officials noted that weekend registration has made the process smoother for buyers and sellers alike, especially for those who previously struggled to visit sub-registrar offices during the week due to packed schedules.","The initiative, aimed at easing weekday congestion at sub-registrar offices, brought in more than Rs 3 crore in revenue on that one day alone.

US President Donald Trump has unveiled a federal plan to boost future financial security for the next generation.The initiative includes opening $1,000 investment accounts for every American baby born between 2025 and 2029, reports the Guardian.The MAGA supremo describes this move as “a pro-family” effort, which is part of a sweeping bill that has passed the House but still faces hurdles in the Senate.The accounts are dubbed as “Trump accounts,” and would be tax-deferred and track stock market performance.“For every US citizen born after December 31, 2024, before January 1, 2029, the federal government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 into a tax-deferred account that will track the overall stock market,” Trump said during a White House roundtable with major business leaders.Parents or guardians will manage these ""Trump accounts,"" which allow up to $5,000 in additional annual contributions from private sources. Trump pitched the initiative as a way for families to benefit directly from the strength of the American economy. “It’s a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation,” he said.The plan has received strong backing from several prominent CEOs, including Michael Dell, Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi, Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Robinhood's Vladimir Tenev.Trump applauded their commitment, saying they were “really the greatest business minds we have today” and that they were “committed to contributing millions of dollars to the Trump account.”House Speaker Mike Johnson also praised the scheme. “It’s a bold, transformative policy that gives every eligible American child a financial head start from day one,” he said. “Republicans are proud to be the party we always have been. It supports life and families, prosperity and opportunity.”The accounts are part of what Trump calls his “one big, beautiful bill.” The bill is a sweeping budget package that, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), could add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO also warned that the proposed changes, which include cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, could leave nearly 11 million more Americans without healthcare by 2034.Despite the criticism, Trump remains optimistic. “Beneficiaries would really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future,” he said.Johnson warned that failing to pass the bill would lead to “the largest tax increase in American history.” Johnson urged lawmakers to back what he called “pro-growth legislation” to benefit all Americans.","US President Donald Trump has unveiled a federal plan to boost future financial security for the next generation.

JUST IN: President Trump Reveals 'Trump Accounts' Proposal For Newborn Citizens





US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a federal initiative to provide $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American children born between 2025 and 2029.According to the Guardian, the proposal, part of what Trump calls “the big beautiful bill,” was announced at a White House roundtable with top business leaders and Republican lawmakers.“For every US citizen born after December 31, 2024, before January 1, 2029, the federal government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 into a tax-deferred account that will track the overall stock market,” Trump said.Dubbed “Trump accounts,” the program is designed to give children a financial jumpstart and will allow guardians to make additional contributions of up to $5,000 annually. Trump described the initiative as “a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation.”Business leaders at the event, including Michael Dell (Dell Technologies), Dara Khosrowshahi (Uber), David Solomon (Goldman Sachs), and Vladimir Tenev (Robinhood), pledged billions in private contributions for employee families. Trump praised them as “really the greatest business minds we have today” and said they are “committed to contributing millions of dollars to the Trump account.”House Speaker Mike Johnson, also present, hailed the plan: “It’s a bold, transformative policy that gives every eligible American child a financial head start from day one.Republicans are proud to be the party we always have been. It supports life and families, prosperity and opportunity.”The Trump accounts are part of a sweeping budget bill that passed the House by a single vote, without Democratic support. The legislation faces a tougher path in the Senate, where some Republicans have voiced concerns over its broader fiscal implications.While Trump insists the bill is “fully funded through targeted reforms,” including welfare changes and a remittance tax, the Congressional Budget Office last week reported it would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO also projected that 10.9 million more Americans would be without healthcare by 2034 due to cuts to Medicaid and food assistance.The accounts resemble 529 college savings plans but with lower contribution limits, prompting some financial advisors to question their investment value.Similar programs have existed elsewhere: the UK operated a Child Trust Fund from 2002 to 2011, while Singapore continues to run a Baby Bonus Scheme with matched savings incentives.Trump expressed confidence in the long-term benefits of the plan, saying beneficiaries would “really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future.”Speaker Johnson added that failure to pass the legislation would result in “the largest tax increase in American history,” urging swift congressional action on what he called “pro-growth legislation” that would “help every single American.”","US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a federal initiative to provide $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American children born between 2025 and 2029.

'Other members weren't happy with Pak attitude'





NEW DELHI: Pakistan's demands, as a non-permanent member of UN Security Council (UNSC), for leadership of four terrorism-related committees have been rebuffed by other members of the council, official sources here said. The country had to make do with chairship of only the 1988 Taliban Sanctions Committee.Pakistan had demanded chairships of the 1267 Sanctions Committee; 1540 (Non-Proliferation) Sanctions Committee; 1988 Taliban Committee; and 1373 Counter Terrorism Committee (CTC). Apart from the Taliban committee, it has also been allowed CTC's vice-chairship. India sees this as well short of its neighbour's ""tall expectations and claims"".Pakistan's demands caused a lack of consensus in UNSC, delaying the process of allocation of UN committees by about five months. ""The allocation should have been undertaken by Jan 2025,"" said an official.An official, who said Pakistan's demands had delayed the process of allocation of UN committees by about five months, said: ""A lack of consensus and unreasonable demands by Pakistan prevented a consensus till June 2025.The other council members were not happy with this uncompromising and undeserving attitude depicted by Pakistan's demands.""Any effort by Pakistan to target India on the issue of terrorism is likely to run into serious checks and balances, likely to be imposed by other members.An official source, who did not want to be named, said countries (China, France, Russia, UK and the US - the five permanent UNSC members) didn't want to head any of the committees, knowing well that chairs don't matter much, as they can only operate through consensus.Chairships do allow non-permanent members to make some noise, as Pakistan has been doing, the official added.While the Taliban committee is mandated with overseeing the implementation of sanctions on terrorists and designating individuals and entities which meet the listing criteria, the presence of friendly countries - such as Russia and Guyana - as vice-chairs in the committee would be reassuring for India.""India will work closely with its friends in the council,"" an official said.Govt sources also said that the position of vice-chair of the CTC, which Pakistan has been allocated, was not very substantive.It is not even a co-chair, and the post is ceremonial.""Pakistan, despite all its rhetoric, has not been able to get its way,"" said another source on the condition of anonymity. ""India was chair of the 1373 CTC in 2022. India had earlier, too, during its 2011-'12 UNSC term, chaired the 1373 CTC."" The source added that this reflected Pakistan's ""standing and credibility"" in the UN.","Pakistan's demands, as a non-permanent member of UN Security Council (UNSC), for leadership of four terrorism-related committees have been rebuffed.
