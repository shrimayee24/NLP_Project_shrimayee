NEW DELHI: NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday made a significant revelation about the future of the Nationalist Congress Party, saying that talks to merge the two rival NCP factions were already under way and had progressed to an advanced stage before the sudden death of his nephew and party chief Ajit Pawar Speaking at a press conference, Sharad Pawar said the proposed merger was not only under discussion but was also in line with Ajit Pawar’s own wishes.“Now we feel his wish should be fulfilled. Ajit Pawar, Shashikant Shinde and Jayant Patil had initiated the talks about the merger of the two factions. Even the merger date had been fixed — it was scheduled on the 12th (February). Unfortunately, Ajit left us before that,” Sharad Pawar said.This disclosure comes amid intense political activity in Maharashtra following Ajit Pawar’s death and reports that his wife, Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Pawar, is likely to be sworn in as deputy chief minister.Sharad Pawar, however, maintained that he had no prior information about her possible elevation, underlining that key decisions were being taken by leaders in Mumbai and not in consultation with him.When asked whether he, as a senior member of the Pawar family, was taken into confidence regarding Sunetra Pawar’s possible appointment as deputy chief minister, Sharad Pawar sought to downplay any suggestion of discord.“Family stands united if an issue occurs in the family. There are no issues in the family,” he said.Sharad Pawar made it clear that discussions on political and organisational decisions were taking place away from him.Responding to questions on the apparent haste in decision-making after Ajit Pawar’s death, he said, “All these discussions are not taking place here; they are happening in Mumbai. Praful Patel, Sunil Tatkare and other senior leaders are having these discussions. Whatever is being seen appears to be decisions taken by them. I will not comment on this.”","Sunetra Pawar likely to be sworn in as Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister, replacing her late husband and NCP chief Ajit Pawar in the state cabinet.

Food makers may have to keep daily production logs; stricter storage rules proposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/food-makers-may-have-to-keep-daily-production-logs-stricter-storage-rules-proposed/articleshow/127813111.cms,"NEW DELHI: To make food safer and more traceable, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has proposed new rules that would require food manufacturers to record what they produce and what raw materials they use every day, according to a draft notification issued in the Gazette.The proposed changes aim to improve hygiene, accountability and consumer safety, especially in processed and packaged foods.Under the draft rules, food manufacturing units will have to maintain daily records of production and ingredients, making it easier for regulators to track problems such as contamination, substandard ingredients or unsafe batches. Traders and distributors who do not manufacture food will not be covered under this requirement.The draft also seeks to enforce stricter storage practices. Food businesses will have to follow “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and “first-expire, first-out” (FEFO) principles, ensuring that older or near-expiry food is used or sold first. This is intended to reduce the risk of expired or unsafe food reaching consumers. Retail shops, however, have been kept out of this provision.FSSAI has invited public feedback for 30 days before finalising the rules.Officials say the move is part of a wider effort to strengthen food safety as India’s food market expands, and to give consumers greater confidence in the quality of food they buy.","Proposed changes aim to improve hygiene, accountability and consumer safety.

Owaisi Slams MCD Demolition, Says Turkman Gate Land Fully Belongs To Waqf

New Delhi: Supreme Court has said offering of prayers by Muslims at premises not included on the list of auqaf cannot give it the character of a mosque and ruled unless the mosque stood over waqf land, waqf tribunal could not entertain a suit to declare the place a mosque.The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008 but the owner of the land and the builder of the apartments stopped access to it in 2021.One Mohammed Ahmed filed a suit before the waqf tribunal seeking to restrain Habib Alladin and others from causing hindrance to those visiting the Mahmood Habib Masjid and Islamic Centre. The owner of the plot moved Telangana HC, claiming the building plan made no mention of the area in dispute as a mosque and, hence, the tribunal could not have entertained the suit. The HC had rejected the plea.After analysing judgments on the issue, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran said, “A reading of Section 6 and 7 (of Waqf Act, 1995) makes it clear that the jurisdiction, to determine whether or not a property is a waqf property, or whether a waqf is a Shia waqf or a Sunni waqf, inheres in the tribunal only if the particular property is specified as waqf property in the ‘list of auqaf’.”The bench said, “A bare reading of the plaint would indicate that neither is the property specified in the ‘list of auqaf’ as published in Chapter II nor registered under Chapter V and hence the decision as to whether the property is a waqf property or not cannot be decided by the tribunal since the property is not one specified in the ‘list of auqaf’, which is the mandatory requirement... to approach the tribunal.”SC said, “We will not consider the issue as to whether the property can be deemed to be a ‘waqf by user’ since the question is still at large.” It set aside the tribunal order assuming jurisdiction and the HC order affirming it.","The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008.

"Why has gold and silver prices fallen? Brutal selloff! Gold, silver prices crash in exceptionally volatile session - what’s causing the sudden dip?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/brutal-selloff-gold-silver-prices-crash-in-exceptionally-volatile-session-whats-causing-the-sudden-dip/articleshow/127793760.cms,"Representative AI image

ETFs crashes 14%

'2008-crisis levels'

What now

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and silver futures saw a sharp decline on Friday as traders locked in profits following Thursday's record-breaking rally. Both Gold and silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange ended Friday’s session with steep losses, retreating sharply as traders booked profits following a powerful rally earlier in the week that had driven both metals to new all-time highs. Bearish global markets and a stronger US dollar also influenced the sentiment. It was one of the steepest single-day fall for both gold and silver prices in the past few months in futures trade. Gold and silver exchange traded funds or ETFS have also dropped up to 20% n the domestic markets.Gold futures expiring on February 5, 2026, slid by as much as Rs 11,000, or 6.5%, to settle at Rs 1,59,984 per 10 grams. Silver contracts for March 5, 2026, delivery saw an even steeper decline, plunging Rs 68,000, or 16.6%, to Rs 3,34,503 per kg - going below the Rs 3.5 lakh per kg mark.The dramatic shift came after both metals had achieved historic highs the previous day. Silver had peaked at Rs 4,20,048 per kg before settling lower, while gold had touched Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The pullback was particularly noticeable in international markets, with Comex gold falling 2.2% to USD 5,236.74 per ounce.""After hitting record highs, gold and silver prices dropped as a rebound in the US dollar triggered aggressive profit-taking,"" said Manav Modi from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, as quoted by PTI.The dollar index bounced back from recent lows of 96, while the USD/INR pair hit a record high.The World Gold Council has raised concerns about India's future gold imports. They expect a decline in jewelry demand from the world's second-largest consumer due to record-high prices. The council also noted that central bank purchases slowed in Q4 2025, though strong investor interest helped offset this decrease.Despite the current dip, gold is still headed for its best monthly performance since the 1980s. Silver, too, remains impressive with a potential January gain exceeding 50%, its strongest monthly showing ever. Market expert Jigar Trivedi attributed this to ""a weak US dollar and shifting US monetary policy outlook.""Looking ahead, traders are turning their attention to upcoming US Producer Price Index numbers, which will offer new insights into monetary policy direction. The recent price movements highlight the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions on precious metals markets.Gold and silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also plunged by up to 14 per cent on Friday as investors rushed to book profits after precious metals retreated sharply from record highs, prompting debate over whether the correction offers a buying opportunity or signals the end of the powerful rally.The fall followed a surge in January, when silver jumped 56 per cent, putting it on course for its strongest monthly performance on record, while gold logged its biggest monthly gain since January 1980, rising more than 20 per cent in dollar terms.Silver-focused ETFs led the losses. Zerodha Silver ETF and SBI Silver ETF fell 14 per cent, while Nippon India Silver ETF dropped 14 per cent and Kotak Silver ETF declined 12 per cent. Gold ETFs also slipped, with Nippon India Gold ETF down 10 per cent and ICICI Prudential Gold ETF losing 6 per cent. ICICI Prudential Silver ETF fell 7 per cent.The domestic selloff tracked global markets, where spot silver slid 5.7 per cent to $109.55 an ounce after touching a record $121.64 a day earlier. Spot gold fell 3.9 per cent to $5,183.21 per ounce, after dropping as much as 5 per cent from Thursday’s peak of $5,594.82.The sharp reversal came after US President Donald Trump said he would soon announce his pick to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with reports pointing to former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a likely candidate.“So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar, and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,” said KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer, as quoted by ET.Expectations of a more hawkish Fed unsettled investors who had been betting on looser monetary policy. “Gold and silver show very high volatility, and prices dip from record high levels amid heavy profit-taking; safe-haven buying could support prices,” said Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart.Jain noted that both metals had ended the previous session higher in global and domestic futures markets before surging to fresh records in early trade, only to face intense profit-taking at elevated levels.Despite the selloff, the broader trend remains strong. Silver is set for its ninth consecutive monthly gain, while gold is heading for a sixth straight monthly advance. “Silver fell about 4% toward $110/oz, retreating from all-time highs as investors locked in profits following the record rally, while, rebound in the dollar added pressure on the metal,” said Jigar Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst at Indusind Securities. “Despite the pullback, silver is on track to gain more than 50% in January, marking its best monthly performance on record and extending a winning streak to nine consecutive months,"" he added.The rally has been supported by persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainty, strong safe-haven demand, and a weaker dollar. Trivedi added that “silver’s surge was further supported by a tight physical market, with both investment and industrial demand hitting record levels.”An industry commentary on the global capital markets platform The Kobeissi Letter made a remark that vent viral on how gold's volatality has reached ""2008-crisis levels"".""This is absolutely insane: Gold just posted its largest daily swing in market cap in history, at $5.5 TRILLION. Between 9:30 AM ET and 10:25 AM ET, gold lost -$3.2 trillion in market cap, or -$58 billion PER MINUTE. Then, between 10:25 AM ET and 4:00 PM ET, gold added back +$2.3 trillion. That's over 3 TIMES the market cap of Bitcoin swung in 6.5 hours, or ~$850 billion per hour,"" it said on X.Further commenting on its significance, it added, ""We are witnessing one of the most historic trading opportunities of all time. Gold's volatility is above 2008 levels.""Outlooks for both gold and silver for the year point to strong long-term support but elevated volatility. Major banks such as UBS, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale remain bullish on gold, citing safe-haven demand, geopolitical tensions and portfolio diversification, according to ET. Silver forecasts are more divided. Some, such as Citigroup, see significant upside driven by structural demand and supply deficits, while stretigists Marko Kolanovic warn that prices could correct sharply if speculative positions unwind.However, across both metals, analysts agree that price swings will remain a defining feature, shaped by macro uncertainty, monetary policy, liquidity conditions and shifting investor positioning.",Both Gold and silver futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange ended Friday’s session with steep losses. Bearish global markets and a stronger US dollar also influenced the sentiment. It was one of the steepest single-day fall for both gold and silver prices in the past few months in futures trade.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127794274,imgsize-1330666,width-400,resizemode-4/article-98.jpg"

"‘Low risk, travel curbs not needed’: WHO assesses Nipah virus cases in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/low-risk-travel-curbs-not-needed-who-assesses-nipah-virus-cases-in-india/articleshow/127793717.cms,"(IANS)

NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sought to reassure the public over India’s latest Nipah virus outbreak, saying the risk of spread remains “low” and that there is no need for travel or trade restrictions following the confirmation of two cases in West Bengal.The cases were reported from North 24 Parganas district, an area that has seen Nipah outbreaks in the past.Both patients are 25-year-old nurses—a woman and a man—working at the same private hospital in Barasat. They developed initial symptoms in the last week of December 2025, which rapidly progressed to neurological complications. The two were placed in isolation in early January.In an update shared on its website, following confirmation of the cases, WHO said an extensive public health response was activated. Authorities identified, traced, monitored, and tested 196 contacts linked to the two patients. All contacts were asymptomatic and tested negative for Nipah virus infection. As of 27 January, no additional cases were been detected. “ The likelihood of spread to other Indian states or internationally is considered low. ”WHO assessed the risk at the sub-national level in West Bengal as moderate due to the presence of fruit bat reservoirs in border areas and the possibility of sporadic spillover.However, the agency said the national, regional, and global risk remains low.“Based on current evidence, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions,” said the agency.The national government deployed an outbreak response team to West Bengal to work closely with state authorities. Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control measures, and field investigations are underway. WHO said coordinated efforts between central and state health teams have enabled timely containment of the outbreak.""Nipah virus is a zoonotic disease transmitted mainly from bats to humans, sometimes through contaminated food or close contact. With no licensed vaccine or treatment currently available, early detection, supportive care, and strong infection prevention measures remain essential,"" said WHO on it's website.Historically, Nipah outbreaks in the WHO South-East Asia Region have been limited to Bangladesh and India, occurring sporadically or in small clusters. Human-to-human transmission is rare and usually confined to health-care settings or close family contacts, with no known instances of international spread through travel.This is the seventh documented Nipah outbreak in India and the third in West Bengal, following earlier outbreaks in Siliguri in 2001 and Nadia in 2007. The affected districts border Bangladesh, where Nipah outbreaks occur almost annually.WHO said several vaccine candidates are under development, but early supportive care, including intensive treatment for severe respiratory or neurological complications, remains critical for improving survival.","The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sought to reassure the public over India’s latest Nipah virus outbreak.

Russia Backs India’s Energy Needs As Putin Defies Trump And Promises Steady Fuel Supplies To Delhi

New Delhi: Russian state-run atomic energy corporation Rosatom, during the India Energy Week in Goa, presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units — a unique Russian technology for countries like India with long coastlines and developed island territories.Rosatom also presented a comprehensive approach to solving problems in the field of nuclear energy and showed openness to the implementation of joint research projects.Russian company officials at the Goa event paid special attention to possibilities of scientific and technical cooperation based on multipurpose fast research reactor MBIR, which, after commissioning in 2028, will become the most powerful research reactor globally. India has also been invited to join an international consortium based on the reactor and participate in multilateral research programmes.“India is a strategic partner, cooperation with which has been building for many years and is aimed at developing nuclear and related industries. Joint nuclear projects form a solid technological and human foundation, designed for decades to come. The experience of implementing our flagship project, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, shows that we do not just work on individual tasks for the facility, but accompany the project throughout its life cycle, contributing to the industrial transformation of India,” Rosatom International Network CEO Egor Kvyatkovsky said.“We see great potential for deepening cooperation in both large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs) construction projects, as well as in non-energy areas such as nuclear medicine, isotope supply, joint research projects, additive technologies and digital solutions,” he said.Rosatom, which has been actively helping India build six 1,000 MW VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, is also discussing new areas of cooperation such as construction of Russian-designed low-power nuclear power plants (ASMMs) in India. ASMM technologies are focused on providing clean electricity to remote areas with limited network infrastructure, as well as energy supply to individual industrial enterprises.ENDSCaption: Rosatom is already helping India set up six nuclear reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu","Rosatom presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units.

Govt likely to consider allowing export of wheat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-likely-to-consider-allowing-export-of-wheat/articleshow/127809305.cms,".

New Delhi: The govt may consider allowing export of wheat as the stock of the foodgrain with Food Corporation of India is now almost double of the required buffer and the prospect of a bumper harvest this year.As per govt data, the overall wheat sown area this year is at a record 33.4 million hectare, 3% higher than last year. There is a prospect of another bumper crop this year, following a record 118 million tonne (MT) of wheat production in 2024-25.TOI has learnt that deliberations over the issue of allowing wheat export at an inter-ministerial committee are underway and a decision would be taken soon. The govt had imposed a ban on wheat export in May 2022 following less production.At present, FCI holds wheat stock of 25.9 MT against the required buffer of 13.8 MT for Jan 1. “So, there is no issue so far as meeting the domestic demand is concerned. There is enough wheat available in the domestic market. It won’t be an issue, if we allow export of some quantity of the foodgrain,” said a govt official.Earlier this month, the govt eased the ban on wheat product exports by permitting limited, regulated shipments of wheat flour and related processed products. The govt has capped such exports at five lakh tonnes.","The overall wheat sown area this year is at a record 33.4 million hectare, 3% higher than last year.

New Delhi: NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions and in nearly 35% of these cases, the vehicles were not at the toll plaza when the user fee was debited from FASTag wallet.Considering that such transactions happen due to manual entry of vehicle details by toll operators because of some issue, the road transport ministry is mulling doing away with this option completely.In a written reply, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari informed the Lok Sabha Thursday that National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), which provides the Central Clearing House (CCH) services of electronic toll collection , ""has reported 17.6 lakh transactions where refunds were made due to incorrect user fee (toll) deductions from Jan-2025 to Dec-2025 out of a total of 464 crore FASTag transactions"".This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, ""Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn't happen.

Lucknow: Akhilesh On UGC Rules, SC Stay Sparks Student Debate, Sambhal Police FIR Issue And More

New UGC norms silent on penalty for false complaints

New Delhi: A day after Supreme Court stayed UGC's Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, the education ministry began examining on Friday the removal of the “false complaints” clause that featured in the 2025 draft but was dropped from the final notified rules.Those from the general category have argued that in the absence of a deterrent, false complaints may be used to harass them. Opponents of the regulations pointed out that the new framework includes other backward classes — a category not covered under the 2012 regulations — leaving the general category “without remedies for discrimination faced by them”.While removing OBCs from the purview of the regulations may not be an easy option, sources said the Centre is examining whether safeguards against false complaints need to be restored and the ambit of the anti-discrimination mechanism be expanded to cover EWS.Supreme Court put on hold Thursday the regulations notified on Jan 13, taking serious exception to several provisions and observing that they could fuel societal divisions and have a dangerous impact on the goal of a casteless society.Sections 2 and 3(c) of the regulations, which define beneficiaries as “socially and educationally backward classes” and state that “caste-based discrimination” refers to discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs.Notably, OBCs were not mentioned in Regulation 3(c) of the draft but were added in the notified rules this year.The draft regulations provided for penalties against false complaints. The deleted provision stated that anyone filing a false discrimination complaint could face a fine determined by the equity committee, with repeat or serious violations potentially leading to disciplinary action under institutional rules.A senior govt official said, “This is being examined along with compliance with SC’s directions, including its observation on setting up a panel of experts to study the regulations.”The court flagged concerns around possible “segregation” of students. Section 7 of the regulations, dealing with measures for promotion of equity, states that any selection, segregation or allocation related to hostels, classrooms or mentorship groups must be transparent, fair and non-discriminatory.","Supreme Court stayed UGC's Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026.

New Delhi: Delhi high court on Friday questioned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) over the “indefinite” relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave, reports Abhinav Garg.Hearing a PIL that raised the issue, a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia sought an explanation as to why the aviation regulator deferred the implementation of the new flight-duty norms soon after introducing them. “What is the rationale for withdrawal of this? And this applies to all airlines,” the bench asked the DGCA counsel. The HC issued notice, giving DGCA two weeks’ time to respond.The new regulations mandate that “no leave shall be substituted by weekly rest”. On Dec 5, 2025, DGCA eased the Flight Duty Time Limitations to allow IndiGo to deploy more pilots on duty in order to reduce disruptions. The move came after IndiGo cancelled hundreds of flights nationwide in the first week of Dec after failing to prepare for the implementation of the new flight-duty norms for pilots.",The Delhi high court questioned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) over the ‘indefinite’ relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave.

New Delhi: Observing that doctors administering speculative, unproven or experimental treatments on patients amounts to professional misconduct and negligence, Supreme Court on Friday said stem cell therapy cannot be used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment and expressed displeasure that the Centre has not taken suitable action to prevent it.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan also directed putting in place rules, regulations and guidelines to govern stem cell-based clinical trials and research in the country.“A medical practitioner who administers speculative, unproven or experimental treatment even when credible professional bodies have expressly advised against the use of such an intervention, may be held liable on count of professional misconduct. We say so because the administration of such a treatment would fail to satisfy the standard of reasonable care necessitated under the established medical negligence jurisprudence in India,” the bench said.It said every medical practitioner owes to his or her patient a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care, skill and knowledge expected of a prudent practitioner in the field. “A medical practitioner cannot be said to meet the standard of reasonable care if he administers an intervention that lacks credible scientific evidence of safety and efficacy, or where authoritative medical bodies unequivocally state that such form of treatment is not recommended,” the bench said.The court noted that although stem cells administered for therapeutic use in ASD are characterised as “drugs” under the Drugs Act, 1940, yet the same by itself is not determinative of the fact that it is permissible to be administered as a clinical service. It said if a medical intervention is characterised as unproven, experimental, obsolete or lacking justification by the scientific community, then such an intervention cannot be allowed by doctors.“It is unfortunate that the Union has let the matter worsen without any suitable and timely intervention. Such inaction has led to several parents/guardians seeking an unproven method of treatment for their children suffering from ASD, incurring huge financial cost and in alternative to other approved treatments,” the Supreme Court said.It said, “It cannot be denied that various clinics, in flagrant violation of the statutory mandate, continued to recommend and perform stem cell therapy as a routine clinical treatment for ASD because there was lack of executive action against the same. Therefore, we urge the Union to consolidate and clarify the position of law for enabling better implementation of the same in this regard at the earliest.”","Stem cell therapy cannot be used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment.

Failure to provide pads creates gender-specific barrier, says SC

New Delhi: Bringing the right of access to menstrual hygiene and gender-segregated toilets within the ambit of fundamental rights, Supreme Court directed states and Union territories on Friday to provide free sanitary napkins to adolescent girls in all govt and private schools and also construct separate toilets for them on campus.In a judgment jointly authored by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, the bench fixed a timeline of three months for the govts to enforce its direction. In order to ensure that its directions did not remain only on paper, it decided to monitor its implementation and posted the case for hearing after three months to examine compliance. ""We wish to communicate to every girl child, who might have become a victim of absenteeism because her body was perceived as a burden, that the fault is not hers. These words must travel beyond the courtroom, law review reports, and reach the everyday conscience of society at large,"" the bench said.The court passed the landmark judgement on a PIL filed by social activist Jaya Thakur after her lawyer Varun Thakur brought to the SC's notice various studies which showed that lack of access to menstrual hygiene is a big stumbling block for girls to get education, particularly in rural areas.The court said the absence of the measures entrenches gendered disadvantage by converting a biological reality into a structural exclusion which must be removed.“Dignity finds expression in conditions that enable individuals to live without humiliation, exclusion, or avoidable suffering. The right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to menstrual health. Access to safe, effective, and affordable menstrual hygiene management measures helps a girl child attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. The right to healthy reproductive life embraces the right to access education and information about sexual health,” it said.Observing that quality of education goes beyond textbooks, teachers, or classrooms, and it includes all the conditions that enable effective learning and continuity of schooling, the bench said the failure to provide sanitary napkins creates a gender-specific barrier that impedes attendance, and continuity in education, thereby defeating the substantive guarantee of free and compulsory education.It directed measures be taken to spread awareness about it to ensure that menstruation should not be a topic that is only shared in whispers. It ordered NCERT and the State Council of Educational Research and Training to incorporate gender responsive curricula, more particularly on menstruation, puberty, and other related health concerns, with a view to break stigma and taboo associated with menstrual health and hygiene.“It is crucial that boys are educated about the biological reality of menstruation. A male student, unsensitised towards the issue, may harass a menstruating girl child which may discourage her from attending school… Time is overripe that we recognise menstrual health as a shared responsibility rather than a woman’s issue. Awareness must not be limited to girls, but extends to boys, parents, and teachers. When menstruation is discussed openly in schools, it ceases to be a source of shame. It is recognised as what it is, a biological fact. Needless to say, it must be seen as a collective effort rather than a constitutional pull,” the bench said.Regarding lack of gender-segregated toilets in schools despite almost two decades after the Right to Education law was passed, the bench said, “What emerges is a stark constitutional failure, inasmuch as, although the statute mandates barrier-free access to the school building and separate toilets for boys and girls, yet, even after almost 17 years of enactment of the legislation, many schools continue to lack basic necessities for students. The norms and standards laid down in the Schedule are not merely procedural in nature but are integral to the effective realisation of Section 3 of the RTE Act, and more particularly, the right to education under Article 21A.”",Supreme Court directs states and Union territories to provide free sanitary napkins to adolescent girls in all govt and private schools.

BMC Polls 2026: Inside Mumbai’s Civic Giant Whose Budget Is Bigger Than Many Indian States

NEW DELHI: Delay in municipal elections in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru has deprived their civic bodies from getting grants earmarked as per the 15th Finance Commission. The tenure of the current commission ends on Saturday. All grants under the commission were linked to the timely election for municipal entities.Considering that the civic election in Mumbai was held after a gap of seven years, the BMC and the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) did not get the entire Rs 4,031 crore allocated under the Finance Commission’s framework. Similarly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike did not get Rs 2,304 crore as the municipal election was delayed by five years.“This provision of linking grant to existing elected local govt was a significant move by the 15th Finance Commission. But it seems political reasons override the expected financial grant that a city would get. Municipal elections have been subject to political considerations across all political regimes,” said an expert in urban governance.A recent study by Janaagraha, a Bengaluru-based not-for-profit institution, found that as many as 61% of urban local bodies across 17 states experienced postponements of municipal elections in recent years."," delay in municipal elections in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru has deprived their civic bodies from getting grants earmarked as per the 15th Finance Commission.

KURUKSHETRA:

Former chief minister and leader of the opposition in Haryana Vidhan Sabha Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said the BJP is committing a great betrayal against the poor people of Haryana. This government took the votes of the poor by issuing ration cards during the elections, and now their ration cards are being arbitrarily canceled.Hooda was in Kurukshetra to offer condolences to the families of former minister Harmohinder Singh Chatha's wife and MLA Ramkaran Kala's elder brother, who recently passed away.Speaking to reporters later, Hooda said the BJP government is committing a great injustice against the poor in the name of Family IDs. “Ration cards of 70,000 families have been canceled in the last six months alone due to minor errors in names, ages, and other details,” he said.“This is not just a statistic, but a painful story of snatching food from the plates of thousands of poor families. Earlier, Haryana topped the entire country by canceling approximately 14 lakh ration cards,” he added.“Ration cards are being canceled, pensions are being stopped due to minor errors in Family IDs, and people are forced to make rounds of district Saral Kendras (government service centers) for months.Most concerning is that even after correcting the errors, the ration and pensions of many families are not being restored. According to reports, the pensions of more than 500,000 people have been stopped so far,” he pointed out.Hooda said that the BJP added 1 crore additional people to the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category to garner votes in the 2024 elections, and immediately after securing votes, they started arbitrarily canceling ration cards.“In response to a question asked during the winter session of Parliament, the central government stated that 4,141,385 ration cards were canceled across the country, with the Haryana government topping the list with 1,343,474 cancellations,” the former Chief Minister said.Hooda questioned why so many ration cards were issued before the elections and why they are being canceled now? “Why is the government not answering this question,” he asked.",Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the BJP government is committing a great injustice against the poor in the name of Family IDs.

Update

Welcome back to another edition of My Take 5, your weekly round-up of top international news. This week we are covering developments in Syria between Damascus and the Kurds, the signing of the India-EU FTA, Russia-Ukraine war negotiations, China’s purging of its top general, and EU’s recognition of Morocco’s position on the Moroccan Sahara. So, let’s get to it.Syria focus: In significant developments in Syria over the past two weeks, the transition government of Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus launched offensives against Kurdish forces in that country’s north and east. The conflict began in Aleppo and then spread out, leading to Kurdish forces retreating from several towns. Importantly, many of these towns had Kurdish SDF run prison camps hosting former ISIS fighters. The US, which has been an ally of the Kurdish SDF, transported many of those fighters to Iraq. But a significant number of former ISIS fighters were also released by Damascus’s forces.There are two points here. First, the conflict between Damascus and the Kurds practically ends efforts to integrate Kurdish forces into the new Syrian army and governance structures as per an agreement last year. I interviewed senior Kurdish-Syrian politician Foza Yusif of the Democratic Union Party, the leading party among Syrian Kurds, on this subject. You can watch the interview here: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/turkey-instigating-syrian-govt-kurdish-politician-slams-u-s-for-damascus-vs-sdf-fighting-watch/amp_videoshow/127467458.cms Yusif was clear that Turkey is instigating al-Sharaa and the Damascus interim government to carry out the attacks against the Kurds.The latter are now left with no choice but to call for a general mobilisation to defend themselves, even as a fragile 15-day truce was announced.Second, there is a larger strategic game being played between Damascus, Turkey, Russia and US. Al-Sharaa is in Moscow to meet Putin as I write this. Moscow is using this meeting to secure its two major military bases in Syria, Hmeimim airbase and the Tartus naval base. Al-Sharaa, despite expectations that he would kick out the Russians completely from Syria after the fall of Assad in 2024, hasn’t done so. Turkey, which is essentially controlling al-Sharaa, wants to neutralise the Syrian Kurds of Rojava. So, Russia, despite sheltering Assad after his ouster, is trying to strike a grand bargain: allow Damascus and Turkey to move against the Kurds in exchange for retaining its military presence in Syria. Earlier this week, Russia also evacuated its forces from Qamishli airport in Kurdish-held northeast Syria, possibly to facilitate Damascus’s oncoming assault against the Kurds.Turkey will be very happy with this. Moscow may already have reached a tacit understanding with Ankara whereby the latter doesn’t create problems for it in the Black Sea in the context of the war in Ukraine where the Europeans have now aggressively started targeting Russian shadow fleet ships. Meanwhile, the US is waiting to see how things pan out. But if it waits longer to deter Damascus from attacking the Kurds, it will lose a huge strategic asset in Syria. True, Washington might think it can deal directly with al-Sharaa. But it should remember that it was the Kurds that fought and defeated ISIS. Not standing with the Kurds now would be a strategic blunder.: At the time of publishing, a deal has been struck between the Syrian interim government and the Kurds, laying out a phased integration of Kurdish forces into the new Syrian army. This will be followed by integration of Kurdish governance structures into Syrian state institutions. But we have been here before. An integration deal between Damascus and the Kurds in March last year went nowhere. Also, already there appears to be some disagreement with the new integration plan – Damascus wants Kurds to join the Syrian military on individual basis, but Kurds favour joining as complete brigades with four such Kurdish brigades being planned. Let’s see if the new integration plan actually works or just serves as a temporary reprieve in tensions.India-EU FTA: India and EU finally concluded their FTA after 18 years of negotiations to produce what is being described as the mother of all trade deals. The deal will either eliminate or substantially reduce tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports by trade value. Many of these are labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, footwear, tea, spices, gems and jewellery, and marine products that were hit by US tariffs. Similarly, EU gets duty-free or lower-tariff access for 97.5% of its exports by value. These will include wine, beer, olive oil, confectionary, European cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals. Of course, the deal has to be signed off on by the EU Council and EU Parliament. That process might take up to a year. There could also be some hurdles as seen with the recent trade deal between EU and the South American Mercosur group.However, the main import of the India-EU trade deal is strategic. Facing American tariffs and threats, New Delhi and Brussels have essentially signalled their defiance and independence to Washington with this deal. This is indeed welcome. Europe for far too long was complacent in the knowledge that the US will always have its back. Trump has shattered that illusion. EU now has to stand on its own feet, reinvigorate its own defence industry and make some smart strategic moves. This is precisely what it is doing with the FTA with India. The latter on its part is also slowly accepting the fact that it can’t perpetually mollycoddle its industries such as automobiles. It must open them up to competition, gain efficiency and compete globally.Overall, a diversified trade profile is any day better than relying on just a few markets. It took Trump to hammer home this truth. Both India and EU are better off for it.Russia-Ukraine war negotiations: Following the Davos summit last week, Ukraine, Russia and US have been engaging in a new round of talks to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. From the Ukrainian side, this round of talks and the Russian participants have appeared to be somewhat constructive. But the sticking points remain Russia’s unjustifiable demand that Ukraine give up all of its Donbas region, control over the now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power, and security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia has said it won’t accept foreign Nato-member troops in Ukraine after the war – UK and France are ready to send troops. But this would be a key pillar of Ukraine’s security guarantees. Without this how can Russia be deterred from carrying out another aggression against Ukraine in the future? It just doesn’t make sense, especially when Nato membership for Ukraine is off the table as per the US.Plus, why should Ukraine give up those territories in Donbas that it currently holds? All of these Russian demands suggest that Moscow is simply putting the entire burden of ending this war on Ukraine when it is itself the aggressor. There is no indication so far of any meaningful climbdown on Russia’s part.That said, as I write this, there are unconfirmed reports of a potential energy ceasefire between the two sides. Trump has also said that he spoke with Putin and asked for a week-long cessation of Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as temperatures are set to dip further next week – Putin has ostensibly agreed, but there is no confirmation of this as yet. Russia has been relentlessly targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure to deliberately heap misery on Ukrainian civilians in the middle of peak winter with sub-zero temperatures – Ukraine has responded by hitting Russian oil infrastructure. So, a pause will be welcome for Ukrainian civilians who are being subjected to Russia’s brutal weaponisation of winter. With another round of talks this weekend, one can only hope for a minor breakthrough.Xi purges top general: In another massive shakeup at the top echelons of the Chinese military, PLA’s top general and vice-chairman of China’s Central Military Commission (CMC) Zhang Youxia was purged along with the head of PLA’s joint operations, Liu Zhenli. This round of purge effectively hollows out the PLA’s top leadership. The CMC now has just two members – President Xi Jinping as chairman and Zhang Shengmin, PLA’s anti-corruption tsar. Critically, all top PLA generals with military experience have now been purged.Again, there can be two interpretations. First, Xi clearly saw a threat in Zhang, who was actually believed to be a close ally of the Chinese president. Officially he has been removed for violation of discipline – a Chinese euphemism for corruption. But there are rumours that he was leaking Chinese nuclear secrets to the Americans. This too may be a red herring and the actual reason could be that Zhang was planning a coup against Xi. After all, he was senior and influential enough to take this risk.Second, whatever the reason, the whole episode makes Xi look bad. If it was an attempted coup, that means divisions within the Chinese leadership. If it was corruption, that means Xi’s anti-corruption drive hasn’t succeeded even after a decade. And if Xi did this to achieve total control over the PLA, that shows insecurity and paranoia. Plus, there are now serious questions about the military preparedness of China. Without experienced generals, a Taiwan invasion is unlikely. Unless Xi is so desperate to get himself another term at the party congress next year that he is willing to surround himself with military yes-men and do that Taiwan invasion to unify domestic support. But he should know better – this strategy totally backfired for Putin in Ukraine. But given China’s economic size and global trade dominance, such unpredictability can only put the world on edge. Here’s the TOI editorial written by me on the subject this week: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/xiopolitics/ EU supports Morocco’s Sahara Autonomy Plan: In another big diplomatic victory for Morocco, the EU officially adopted a unified position supporting Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Moroccan Sahara. In a joint communique with Rabat, the European bloc agreed that “genuine autonomy could represent one of the most realistic solutions” for the long-running artificial dispute. It will be recalled that the Moroccan Sahara issue is a leftover baggage from Morocco’s colonial history. Even after Morocco gained full independence and reunified the Sahara through the historic Green March of 1975, different international players, led by Algeria, have used the Moroccan Sahara issue to strategically hem in Morocco. Algeria’s propping up of the Polisario Front separatist group and sustaining of the artificial Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has been nothing but a strategic tool to prevent Morocco’s natural rise.But the other interesting point is EU’s changed position. Earlier, there wasn’t unanimity among EU members about the Sahara question. But today, faced with Trump’s tariff threats and bullying over Greenland, EU is willing to do more to have an independent, clear, consolidated position on foreign policy and strategic issues. This is welcome, just like the India-EU FTA mentioned above. Happily, on Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara, EU’s and US’s positions now align. That’s a huge win for Rabat.","My Take 5 is your weekly round-up of top international news.

Commission expenses increased 14.18% to Rs 2,883 crore and operating expenses jumped 36.07% to Rs 4,270 crore, largely due to provisions towards wage arrears and retirement benefits.Chairperson Girija Subramanian said domestic gross direct premium growth outpaced the industry average, helping lift the insurer’s market share to 13.4%. She added that global gross written premium for the nine-month period grew 10.5%.“The company recognized provisions of approximately Rs 2,500 Cr toward wage arrears and retirement benefits. While this had a substantial impact on the Combined Operating Ratio, it was partially offset by robust investment income from our equity portfolio. Despite these onetime costs, the company reported stellar Profit Before Tax,”she said.The Rs 1,696 crore for wage arrears and retirement benefits pushed the underwriting loss to Rs 7,046 crore from Rs 4,982 crore a year earlier. The claims ratio for the quarter stood at 99.62%, while the expense ratio rose to 14.56%, taking the combined ratio to 124.01%. Management said the impact was largely due to wage revisions implemented in January, which required total provisions of around Rs 2,500 crore.Investment income provided a cushion, rising 50.99% year-on-year to Rs 8,599 crore, supported by gains from the equity portfolio and favourable market conditions. For the nine months ended December, the company reported profit before tax growth of about 62%.The insurer closed the quarter with a solvency ratio of 1.81 times, well above the regulatory threshold, and said it remained optimistic about sustaining growth momentum amid ongoing reforms and a stable capital position.","New India Assurance reported a 28.86% rise in net profit to Rs 826 crore for the December quarter. Premium income remained firm, with gross written premium increasing 10.47% to Rs 35,555 crore. The strongest growth came from the health and personal accident segment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127804571,imgsize-1050422,width-400,resizemode-4/image-2026-01-30t204138560.jpg"

Besides, illogical fines on people in the name of not doing pollution under check certificates.Responding to the bandh call, BJP spokesperson Manoj Mohapatra said the protest is planned by non-farmers. “Farmers in Odisha are very happy with the Mohan Charan Majhi govt because of its pro-farmer initiatives such as Rs 800 per quintal bonus for paddy,” he said.Amiya Kumar Pattnaik, national coordinator of All India Kisan Congress, farmers’ wing of Congress, said the party will fully support the bandh call as farmers are in distress.

India–EU FTA: Top winners and losers of the 'mother of all trade deals',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indiaeu-fta-top-winners-and-losers-of-the-mother-of-all-trade-deals/articleshow/127641711.cms,"'Biggest In India's History': PM Modi Hails India-EU FTA, Says It Will Reshape Global Economy

What the deal covers

Under the FTA, duties will be cut on 99.5% of goods exported from India to the EU, including seafood and footwear.

In return, India will reduce or eliminate tariffs on 96.6% of goods imported from the EU, including phased cuts for European carmakers and alcohol producers.

Once implemented, the pact will create a combined market of nearly 2 billion people, spanning the world’s fourth-largest economy (India) and the second-largest economic bloc (EU).

Indian apparel manufacturers and gems and jewellery exporters are among the biggest gainers, as EU duties on these products will be cut to zero.

Domestic food producers will also get preferential access to the European market.

However, Indian automakers and liquor companies are expected to face stiffer competition as lower import levies make European products cheaper.

As companies await more details, here’s a look at who stands to gain and and who may lose:

Big winners

Apparel & textiles

Leather & footwear

Gems & jewellery

Food products & seafood

Benefits for India

Preferential access across 97% of tariff lines, covering 99.5% of trade value.

Immediate duty elimination for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery.

Zero-duty entry for $33 billion worth of exports currently facing EU tariffs of 4–26%.

Sensitive sectors like dairy, cereals and poultry are protected.

Losers

Trade without Trump

Liquor makers

Indian carmakers

Why the deal matters

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union on Tuesday announced the conclusion of negotiations for a landmark free trade agreement (FTA), ending talks that began nearly two decades ago.The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement and is expected to significantly boost exports to the 27-nation EU bloc while reshaping competition for several domestic industries.The agreement comes at a time when global trade flows have been disrupted by high US tariffs, fragile supply chains and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.India is currently facing steep tariffs from the US, while the EU is also under threat of higher American duties.India gains immediate zero-duty access to a $263 billion European textile market. The government said tariffs on textile imports will be eliminated immediately.CareEdge Ratings called the deal ""critical"" for improving competitiveness, estimating India could raise its EU market share to 9% from 5%, adding nearly $4.5 billion in annual exports over the medium term.Textile stocks reacted sharply, with KPR Mill, Welspun Living, and Kitex Garments posting strong gains, Bloomberg reported.Tariffs on leather and footwear have been slashed to zero from 17%, opening up a $100 billion EU market for Indian exporters.The EU has granted duty-free access to Indian gems and jewellery. Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said bilateral trade could double to Rs 910 billion in the next three years.""This timely pact will help Indian exporters salvage lost ground,"" he said, noting that exports to the US have fallen sharply.Indian exporters of shrimp, frozen fish and value-added seafood products will get preferential access to the EU market. Producers of tea, coffee, spices, grapes and processed food will also benefit, while safeguards remain in place for sensitive sectors like dairy and poultry.The ""mother of all deals"" comes at a critical moment for the global economy, which has been unsettled by the unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump.The landmark India–EU trade pact is expected to reduce both sides’ dependence on the United States and China.Negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gained momentum after tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.The Trump administration has openly criticised the agreement.Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alleged that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine war by purchasing energy products routed through India.He argued that European countries were weakening their own security by importing refined fuel from India that originates from Russian crude oil, while Washington imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.""We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,"" Bessent said.However, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has dismissed suggestions that US tariffs played a role in pushing the deal forward, saying, ""I don’t think we even discussed this.""India has sharply cut tariffs on European alcohol. Duties on wine have been reduced to 20%, spirits to 40% (from as high as 150%), and beer to 50%.This is expected to intensify competition for Indian liquor firms. ""It’s a negative for Indian liquormakers,"" said Karan Taurani of Elara Securities. Shares of Sula Vineyards, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan fell after the announcement.The pact allows up to 250,000 European vehicles to enter India at preferential rates, with tariffs gradually dropping from 110% to as low as 10%. Duties on auto components will also be scrapped over 5–10 years.Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles slipped following the news.Signed after nearly two decades of negotiations, the agreement marks India’s most ambitious trade pact so far and is set to reshape supply chains, pricing power and growth prospects across sectors.""Textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, pharma, and high-tech engineering"" will benefit from the deal, Munjal Almoula, managing partner for Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India told Bloomberg.India’s goods trade with the EU stood at $136.5 billion in 2024-25, making the bloc its largest trading partner.The FTA is expected to be signed later this year, following legal vetting and approval by the European Parliament.","The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement.

A Challenging Economic Backdrop

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Limited Room for Tax Relief

Capital Gains and Market Participation

The Next Phase of

Tax Simplification

Administrative Reforms

Take away

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

From bricks to blockbusters: How CJ Roy turned Bengaluru’s fringe into fortune,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cj-roy-suicide-he-turned-bengalurus-fringe-into-fortune/articleshow/127809062.cms,"How he sparked flat sales in Kerala

From Maruti 800 to a dream garage

1.3 million followers on Instagram





BENGALURU: From keeping accounts for his mother's modest real estate dealings to becoming an honorary consul and one of Bengaluru's wealthiest developers, 57-year-old CJ Roy's journey is a study in foresight and timing.Roy didn't build his fortune by chasing obvious opportunities. Instead, he made his biggest bet on land most others dismissed — tracts along Sarjapur Road that would later transform into Bengaluru's bustling tech corridor.Also read: 'Kept briefcase with pistol close': How CJ Roy’s final hours unfolded at his Bengaluru office Roy's early exposure to real estate came not from boardrooms but from his home. His mother, a neighbourhood real estate agent, quietly bought 30-40 sites at a time, built houses and sold them.Roy was not only tracking the accounts but also silently absorbed the mechanism of land transactions and cash flows. That grounding would later help him make informed decisions that reshaped not just his life, but parts of the city itself.Brought up in central Bengaluru, Roy would remember a city that moved at a gentler pace. BTM Lake was once a spot where fishermen cast their nets, paddy fields lay within city limits, and by 6.30pm the streets would be empty.Watching Bengaluru expand outward left a lasting impression on him: cities, he realised early on, grow towards opportunity, not convenience.His professional life began in 1990 with nine-to-five roles at companies such as BPL, TVS and HP before stepping into realty business. ""I came to business by choice, but entrepreneurship happened by chance,"" he had said in an earlier interview.The defining moment came in 2001. At a time when Bengaluru's real estate players were fixated on central business districts, Roy looked to the outskirts. Sarjapura then was little more than a quiet fringe—open fields, long empty roads and acres selling for about Rs 6 lakh. Most saw it as too remote to matter. Roy saw the geography differently. ""With Whitefield emerging on one side and Electronic City booming on the other, I felt Sarjapura could become the midpoint connecting the city's IT workforce,"" he had said. In 2005, he launched Confident Group.He added: ""I had enough capital to buy 150-200 acres in Sarjapura and I decided to go ahead with it instead of sinking money into the CBD (central business district)."" In fact, when he placed the idea before his family and company directors, the proposal met stiff resistance. Only one person supported it—his wife. Trusting that single vote, Roy walked away from central Bengaluru and committed to building on the periphery.The gamble paid off spectacularly. As Sarjapur Road evolved into Bengaluru's tech zone, land values surged, delivering nearly tenfold returns. Subsequently, he bought lands near Devanahalli (close to Kempegowda International Airport) before expanding his business to Kerala and Dubai.According to him, his first purchase comprised two pieces of land in Kakkanad near Kochi. While 100 flats were designed and much was spent on road shows, there were zero sales there. But a chance encounter in Mumbai with an executive of a Malayalam TV channel led him to offer his flat as the prize to the winner of a reality show. He became the brand ambassador of this show and became the talk of the town. The popularity led to flat sales soon after.Roy's relationship with cars began modestly. In 1994, he bought his first vehicle—a Maruti car. It wasn't just a purchase; it was an emotional milestone. In fact, a salesman, dismissive of his curiosity, had asked him to leave. Roy later recalled that the incident sparked a quiet resolve to one day own the world's most iconic cars. Roy went on to own scores of luxury vehicles, including 12 Rolls-Royce cars, a Bugatti Veyron, a Koenigsegg Agera, Lamborghinis, a McLaren 720S, and a Mercedes-Maybach. Roy had stated that he was paying Rs 18 lakh per Rolls-Royce in insurance premium, and the insurance of all his vehicles put together came up to crores. In a full-circle moment, Roy, who once sold his first car to buy his second, recently repurchased that original Maruti car. To trace it, he even announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for anyone who could help him locate and return the car.Roy had an active Instagram presence with 1.3 million followers even though he had disabled the comment section. His last post was a wish for Republic Day where he said, ‘ A Very Happy Republic Day', with a big smile on his face, wearing a blue blazer. It garnered close to 5 lakh views. He posted actively on his cars and choppers, his travel stories, his time with his family (wife and two kids) and his real estate projects.","CJ Roy's early exposure to real estate came not from boardrooms but from his home.

Delhi man critical after taking HIV preventive drugs on AI advice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-man-critical-after-taking-hiv-preventive-drugs-on-ai-advice/articleshow/127812518.cms,"Representative image





NEW DELHI: A 45-year-old Delhi man is critically ill with a rare drug reaction after he took HIV post-exposure medicines bought without prescription, after taking advice from an AI chat platform.The man developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction from the drugs he self-administered after a high-risk sexual contact.Post-exposure drugs are taken to prevent infection after possible HIV exposure, usually through sex or sharing needles. It must be started within 72 hours of exposure and stopped if the source person tests HIV-negative.Doctors treating the patient at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital said the man bought a full 28-day course of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis directly from a local chemist without any prescription, based on AI-generated advice.Doctors said the patient took the medicine for 7 days before developing rashes. He then approached multiple hospitals for treatment for eye and other complications before finally being admitted to RML Hospital. The patient was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a condition that can cause extensive skin and mucosal damage and requires intensive care.""The patient is critical. Our immediate priority is to manage the drug reaction,"" a senior doctor involved in the treatment said.What surprised the doctors was that the patient was able to buy the drugs over the counter, especially when they are no longer routinely prescribed.""The medicines consumed by the patient are not being given by doctors now as treatment protocols are revised,"" a treating physician said.Under national guidelines, HIV post-exposure prophylaxis involves a strictly monitored drug regimen that must be started only after medical evaluation, assessment of exposure risk, baseline testing, and close follow-up for adverse effects. Experts warn that unsupervised use of antiretroviral drugs can trigger life-threatening reactions, organ damage, and long-term complications.The case underscored regulatory gaps in enforcing prescription-only sale of critical drugs, as well as the growing tendency of individuals to rely on AI platforms for medical advice, bypassing trained clinicians.Doctors cautioned that while AI tools may offer general information, they cannot substitute clinical judgement, particularly in high-risk situations.They said it is high time the country adopted standards to restrict online AI platforms from being used for direct health interventions.","A 45-year-old Delhi man is critically ill with a rare drug reaction.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

(Surabhi Marwah is Partner and Co leader Private Client Services, EY India. Ammu Sadanandhan, Director-Tax, EY India and Ojaswita Pathak, Senior Tax Professional, EY India contributed to the article)

The Union Budget 2026 comes at an important moment, as taxpayers prepare for a major shift—the introduction of the Income-tax Act, 2025 (ITA 2025), effective April 1, 2026. This is one of the most significant updates in decades, and many individuals are hoping that the Budget will ease the transition with clarity and stability.With the new system ahead, households are likely to be looking for measures that offer predictability and simpler compliance so families can plan taxes with confidence.In recent years, India’s personal tax framework has steadily moved towards simplification. The concessional new tax regime became the default structure, with reduced slab rates and fewer exemptions. Capital-gains rules were also made more uniform across asset classes. For households, this shift meant ease of filing with lesser documentation to be maintained, clearer choices between regimes and lower chances of inadvertent errors.These reforms appear to have encouraged wider participation: ITR filings rose from 8.13 crore in FY 2023-24 to 8.68 crore in FY 2024-25, a 6.72% increase, and around 72% of taxpayers opted for the new regime in FY 2023-24.The ITA 2025 reduces the number of sections from 819 to 536 and cuts the overall word count nearly in half—from 5.12 lakh to 2.60 lakh. While this represents meaningful structural simplification, individuals will still need help interpreting what has changed. A plain-English FAQ, along with an “old-to-new” comparison and simple illustrations for salary, rent and capital gains, could convert this statutory rewrite into practical time saved for families.Digital ease continues to be a key expectation. Filing has already become smoother with prefilled returns, enhanced dashboards and faster processing. Strengthening these systems further, especially through more comprehensive prefill of capital-gains, dividend and interest information, would help individuals adapt to the new law with fewer follow-ups and less filing-related stress.Investments in Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) seem to have grown, and more streamlining around loss set-off and cross-category VDA movements would be helpful especially for the younger investors who may dabble more in these asset classes. Likewise, retail participation in Futures and Options has risen, and many small investors face audit requirements designed for business traders. Simpler, more practical guidance in both areas would help individuals avoid misreporting and unnecessary compliance burdens.For many families, funds being blocked due to taxes being collected at source (TCS) on foreign remittances remains a routine challenge. While salaried taxpayers are now allowed to set-off the TCS against their salary withholding tax (TDS), not all taxpayers are able to avail this benefit especially where the taxpayer has only other sources of income like interest and dividend. This clubbed with backlog of tax disputes results in taxpayers having to wait for longer durations for refunds to be issued.Faster hearings, clearer procedures and more efficient disposal mechanisms would provide meaningful relief to individuals stuck in long pendency. Quicker closure of small-value appeals (on any issue), in particular, could significantly reduce household stress and unnecessary out-of-pocket costs.Households may also look for targeted relief at the lower end of the income spectrum. Under the new tax regime, the current rebate ensures that individuals with income up to Rs 12 lakh face no tax liability. For salaried taxpayers, the Rs 75,000 standard deduction effectively extends this relief to those with gross income up to Rs 12.75 lakh. A further calibrated enhancement, if considered, could help families manage inflationary pressures while keeping the system simple and aligned with the Budget’s broader focus on stability and taxpayer experience.A related development ahead of the Budget is the ICAI’s recommendation to introduce optional joint taxation for married couples, similar to systems in the US and Germany. Under the current law, each spouse files separately, which can disadvantage single-income households that cannot utilise the second spouse’s unused exemptions. Allowing couples to file a joint return could offer meaningful relief to families that pool incomes and plan finances together, particularly where income distribution between spouses is uneven.Overall, as households prepare for this major legislative transition, what they are seeking most is clarity, simplicity and stability. Straightforward rules, easy-to-understand guidance and stronger digital support can help individuals adjust to the new framework with confidence. Addressing administrative challenges, such as TDS/ TCS complexity and delays in dispute resolution, would further ease the transition.","The Union Budget 2026 comes at an important moment, as taxpayers prepare for a major shift.

Nicholas Lee Plumb, a Texas Republican candidate, who announced that he was affected by the latest layoff of Amazon, shared an internal message claiming that it was sent to him by a former colleague, where a discussion about a new engineering team in India was going on. ""We are also forming a new engineering team in India to accelerate product development while supporting operational and data engineering needs,"" the purported message read. The claim, not verified, went viral as many similar claims surfaced that only US employees in certain teams were impacted etc.Amazon announced reductions of 16,000 and called it the organizational changes that started in October. ""The reductions we are making today will impact approximately 16,000 roles across Amazon, and we're again working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted. That starts with offering most US-based employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (timing will vary internationally based on local and country level requirements). Then, for teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we'll provide transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits (as applicable), and more,"" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Expertise and Technology at Amazon wrote in her blog.""While we’re making these changes, we’ll also continue hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future.

""It’s enabled by a global labor market with almost no guardrails. Companies aren’t just competing on products anymore, they’re arbitraging labor across borders, wages, benefits and worker protections.

What to know about UK-China relations as Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Beijing

Geopolitical context: A reset in West-China relations?



BEIJING, CHINA - JANUARY 30: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers remarks at a UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China on January 30, 2026 in Beijing, China. Keir Starmer undertakes a high-profile diplomatic mission to China and Japan, marking the first visit to Beijing by a British leader since 2018.

In a landmark diplomatic breakthrough, China has agreed to relax visa requirements for British citizens, allowing visa-free travel of up to 30 days for tourism and business visits, a move announced during UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s visit to Beijing at the end of January 2026. The agreement, hailed by leaders on both sides as a “win for people-to-people ties”, is the first major travel policy concession by Beijing toward the UK in decades and signals a potential resetting of bilateral relations that have been strained by geopolitical tensions, trade disagreements and differing values on human rights.For the first time since 2018, a British prime minister has undertaken an official visit to China, underscoring a renewed willingness to engage Beijing at the highest levels. On January 29, 2026, Sir Keir Starmer met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior leaders in the Great Hall of the People to discuss a wide range of issues, from trade and investment to global security and people-to-people exchange.The most attention-grabbing outcome was the visa-free travel agreement, under which British citizens holding ordinary passports will be able to enter China without a visa for stays of up to 30 days once the policy takes formal effect. The agreement is understood to be unilateral on China’s part, meaning British citizens benefit without reciprocal visa-free entry for Chinese nationals in the UK.This move brings the UK into alignment with more than 50 countries (including France, Germany, Australia, Japan and Canada) whose citizens already enjoy similar access to mainland China.Starmer described the agreement as “really good progress” in strengthening bilateral ties and facilitating easier travel for tourists, business leaders, academics and cultural exchange participants. He emphasised that this step would support UK businesses seeking to deepen their presence in China’s vast market while also encouraging greater cultural understanding between the two nations.The visa-free travel move is expected to deliver immediate practical benefits -According to travel advisory services, the change is particularly significant for frequent travellers who previously spent time and money, typically around £150 per visa application plus processing logistics, on securing short-stay permits. However, important caveats remain. The visa-free arrangement does not apply to long-term stays, such as work positions, full-time study or residency permits. Standard visa requirements still apply for those purposes.The visa concession was part of a broader package of agreements aimed at boosting economic cooperation between the UK and China. Starmer’s delegation included representatives from major British businesses and professional services sectors (including finance, legal, healthcare and education) signalling that the UK is seeking to expand its services sector footprint in China despite structural barriers in Chinese markets.During talks, leaders also addressed tariff reductions on UK exports such as Scotch whisky, enhancing competitive positioning for British goods in a major consumer market. Such economic gestures come as the UK seeks to diversify trade relationships and reduce over-dependence on Western markets, especially amid turbulent global trade conditions and unpredictable geopolitical shifts.The decision to engage China more deeply reflects a broader strategic posture by the UK: pursuing economic opportunity while navigating geopolitical sensitivity. Starmer has framed the visit as an effort to build “a more sophisticated relationship” with China that balances cooperation with candid discussion on contentious issues, including human rights concerns and global security dynamics.This balancing act has prompted mixed reactions on the political stage. Some voices, including former British lawmakers recently freed from Chinese travel restrictions, view engagement as a step toward constructive dialogue. Others argue that economic incentives should not overshadow persistent concerns over issues such as human rights, surveillance practices, and regional tensions.In the international arena, critics including former US President Donald Trump have described the rapprochement as “very dangerous,” arguing that closer ties with China may compromise Western strategic interests. Starmer, however, has publicly defended the UK’s approach, noting that strengthening ties with China does not require choosing between China and traditional allies such as the United States. Rather, he emphasises that nuanced engagement can help the UK navigate complex global challenges while pursuing British interests.The visa-free agreement comes at a time when multiple Western countries are reassessing their relationship with China. Canada recently received a similar commitment from Beijing for visa-free travel, reflecting a broader Chinese strategy to open its doors to global visitors while promoting economic and cultural exchange. China’s expansion of visa-free policies over recent years, which already included many European, Oceanian and Asian nations, underscores its intent to position itself as a more accessible destination for global mobility and tourism.For the UK, the agreement represents not just an easing of travel restrictions but also a symbol of warming ties after years of downturns in diplomatic engagement. Starmer and Xi’s joint references to long-term strategic cooperation reflect a mutual interest in stabilising relations even amid broader geopolitical headwinds.Despite the announcement, some details including the official start date of the visa-free travel policy have yet to be publicly confirmed by Chinese authorities. That means British travellers should continue to follow existing visa rules until the change is formally implemented.On social media and public forums, many Britons welcomed the change as a practical and people-friendly development, highlighting the travel and business opportunities it unlocks. Others noted frustration that the policy may not take effect immediately, potentially leaving travellers who planned trips under the old visa regime in limbo.Overall, the visa-free agreement between London and Beijing marks one of the most significant developments in UK-China relations in recent years. Whether it paves the way for deeper cooperation or becomes a flashpoint in wider geopolitical debates will depend on how both nations manage the interplay between economic ambition and strategic caution in the years ahead.","China has agreed to relax visa requirements for British citizens, allowing visa- free travel of up to 30 days for tourism and business visits. The agreement, hailed by leaders on both sides as a “win for people-to-people ties’, is the first major travel policy concession by Beijing toward the UK in decades.

Crypto CEO who has become the No 1 enemy of America's biggest banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crypto-ceo-who-has-become-the-no-1-enemy-of-americas-biggest-banks/articleshow/127812350.cms,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong faced a heated exchange with JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon at Davos, accusing banks of lobbying against crypto legislation. Banks, fearing competition from stablecoin rewards, are pushing back against crypto's expansion into consumer finance. This tension highlights a growing rift as digital assets move mainstream, with potential legislative battles ahead.

“You are full of s***,”

What may have fueled Brian Armstrong’s uncomfortable run-ins with bank CEOs at Davos

“After reviewing the Senate Banking draft text over the last 48hrs, Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written.There are too many issues, including:

- A defacto ban on tokenized equities

- DeFi prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial records and removing your right to privacy

- Erosion of the CFTC’s authority, stifling innovation and making it subservient to the SEC

- Draft amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins, allowing banks to ban their competition

We appreciate all the hard work by members of the Senate to reach a bipartisan outcome, but this version would be materially worse than the current status quo.

We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill. Hopefully we can all get to a better draft.

We'll keep fighting for all Americans and for economic freedom. Crypto needs to be treated on a level playing field with the rest of financial services so we can build this industry in a safe and trusted way in America.”

""out there trying to ban their competition""

""without their permission essentially.""

""If you want to be a bank, just be a bank,""

Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly had an intense moment with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos. A report claims that the CEO of the biggest US crypto company was confronted by the chief executive of the biggest bank of US over accusations that banks are trying to sabotage crypto legislation.A report by The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the conversation, claimed that Dimon told Armstrong to stop lying on TV.Dimon, a long-time sceptic who has previously described cryptocurrency as a fraud, said while pointing his index finger directly at Armstrong's face as the Coinbase chief was having coffee with former UK prime minister Tony Blair.This comes after Armstrong accused banks of trying to sabotage legislation that would set a new regulatory framework for digital assets during appearances on business TV programmes earlier that week. However, the confrontation wasn't quite in line with the annual forum's mission to foster cooperation among global leaders.As crypto moves into the mainstream of American finance, some of Wall Street's major players are waking up to the threat. While banks have embraced some aspects of crypto, helping people invest in bitcoin and using digital assets to make money transfers more efficient, they are drawing a line at encroachment on their core business, which is consumer deposits.Banks and Coinbase are at odds over whether crypto exchanges should be allowed to offer consumers regular payouts for holding digital tokens. These so-called rewards would pay holders of stablecoins a recurring fee, say 3.5%. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world currencies like the US dollar.Banks say the payouts are effectively the same as interest on bank accounts, and since banks offer much lower yields, typically under 0.1% in a checking account, they worry that consumers will shift large amounts of money into crypto. According to the banks, this will compromise community banks and business lending.Armstrong and others in the crypto world have argued that the free market should reign and that banks can simply pay higher interest rates to compete with stablecoins or enter the stablecoin business themselves.However, the legislation, known as the Clarity Act, may shape the future of everyday financial services, including bank deposits and electronic payments. In a push to reach a compromise, the White House plans to host a meeting between bank and crypto industry groups with US President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, expected to attend, the WSJ report claimed, citing people familiar with the matter. Coinbase's head of US policy, Kara Calvert, is also slated to attend, the report added.Recently, a Senate committee was prepared to vote on a version of the legislation that could effectively ban companies like Coinbase from offering payouts to customers, which could’ve potentially cost crypto companies billions of dollars. Just before the vote, Armstrong took to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) to write:As per the report, the vote was abruptly postponed within hours of the post being shared. Armstrong's pushback didn't end with his X post. He echoed his view in TV appearances, telling Bloomberg that bank lobbyists wereand accusing banks of lending out their customers' depositsThis led to a series of uncomfortable encounters with bank CEOs at Davos, described by people familiar with the conversations.Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan told Armstrong during a 30-minute meeting last week at the main convention centre in Davos, the report noted.Citigroup's Jane Fraser gave Armstrong less than a minute of her time. Coinbase is a client of both Citi and JPMorgan, and the exchange has business partnerships with other banks.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf offered Armstrong not even a minute. When Armstrong approached him, Scharf told him that there was nothing for them to talk about. The exchange took place while Dimon, Scharf's former boss, stood nearby, the report added.",Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly had an intense moment with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos.
