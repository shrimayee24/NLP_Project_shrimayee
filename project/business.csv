Unified Genomic Chip: PM Modi to launch Unified Genomic Chip and indigenous sex-sorted semen production tech to boost dairy farming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-launch-unified-genomic-chip-and-indigenous-sex-sorted-semen-production-tech-to-boost-dairy-farming/articleshow/113954457.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: In a move that may improve the efficiency of dairy farming and tackle the problem of stray cattle in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will, during his Maharashtra visit on Saturday, launch a Unified Genomic Chip for cattle and an indigenous sex-sorted semen production technology to help farmers multiply high-quality bulls and milch cattle.During this trip, Modi will also release the 18th instalment of financial assistance under the PM-Kisan scheme to over 9.4 crore farmers across the country, amounting to more than Rs 20,000 crore.Tailored for Indian breeds, the Unified Genomic Chip – the 'Gau Chip' for cattle and 'Mahish Chip' for buffalo – will enable farmers to make informed decisions on animal selection by identifying young and high-quality bulls at an early age. On the other hand, the indigenous sex-sorted technology will increase the availability of sex-sorted semen for farmers at a reduced cost for producing only female calves.""Though India has been using sex-sorted technology for producing female calves for a long time, the high cost of imported production technology at Rs 1,000 per dose deters dairy farmers from opting for it, as sometimes animals need multiple doses. The use of indigenous technology will, however, now reduce its cost to Rs 200 per dose,"" said an official in the department of animal husbandry and dairying (DAHD).He said, ""The indigenous technology combined with the Unified Genomic Chip for selecting high-quality and disease-free bulls will not only make the entire effort economically viable for farmers but also substantially reduce the number of non-productive animals who end up as stray on roads and farmlands.""With affordable sex-sorted semen production technology in hand, the DAHD has now planned to produce a minimum of 10 lakh sexed semen doses annually for the ongoing artificial insemination (AI) programme. The IVF technology (commonly known as test tube baby technology) is also being used for this purpose.The sex-sorted semen ensures the birth of only female calves with more than 90% accuracy, whereas the IVF technology makes the process faster. ""Sexed semen of high-grade merit bulls of indigenous breeds will cut short the period of producing desired milch cattle and buffalo. The Unified Genomic Chip will help the process,"" said the official.Launched in February 2019, the PM-Kisan scheme provides Rs 6,000 annually to each landholding farmer family in the country. It is given to them in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000 each. With the 18th instalment release, the total disbursement under the scheme will exceed Rs 3.45 lakh crore, supporting more than 11 crore farmer families.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a Unified Genomic Chip for cattle and an indigenous sex-sorted semen production technology. The move may improve the efficiency of dairy farming and tackle the problem of stray cattle in the country. Modi will also release the 18th instalment of financial assistance under the PM-Kisan scheme.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113954499,imgsize-845151,width-400,resizemode-4/113954499.jpg"
Being frugal in a world of excess,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/being-frugal-in-a-world-of-excess/articleshow/113935570.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

‘The Psychology of Money’ by Morgan Housel has become a popular topic of conversation after actor Arvind Swamy mentioned it in a recent interview. Unlike many others that glorify risk-taking and quick riches, Housel offers a refreshing perspective on financial discipline.

One of my favourite sections in the book discusses the virtues of modest living. ""There are modest folks with hidden wealth, and flashy people who are just a step away from insolvency."" It reminds me of a lesson I learnt years ago.

While cleaning the loft at my parents’ house, I found a dusty bag of childhood treasures—dolls, a Monopoly set and comic books. At the bottom was a pink piggy bank. My mother had used that piggy bank to teach me my first lesson in financial prudence. I’d fill it with coins and the occasional small denomination notes gifted by visiting relatives. Once, a friend of my dad gave me a 50-rupee note, and I felt like Richie Rich! However, there was a catch—my mother held the key. Whenever I wanted an ice cream or a new bangle from ‘John Fancy Shop’ on Triplicane High Road, Amma would ask a series of questions. If it wasn’t a need, but a want, she’d deny the key.

We also had a clay piggy bank, an undiyal, which had no key. It could be broken open only for emergencies. Each month, Amma made us deposit a ten-rupee note in it, reinforcing the idea that savings should only be used when necessary.

In retrospect, I realised that it was the best financial advice I ever received. My parents lived modestly, despite being relatively well-off compared to our neighbours. My father was a school headmaster, and my mother worked for the central govt. We celebrated festivals and birthdays, but there were unspoken rules; only two new outfits a year excluding school uniforms, and one outing a month, either to a cinema or a restaurant.

When we begged for more clothes or accessories, Amma would point at street children who didn’t get three meals a day. “Buy only if you need it, not to show off,” she’d say.

Her words shaped my own financial habits. When I started managing finances, I created two bank accounts—one for essential spending like the pink piggy bank, and the other like the clay one, reserved for a genuine emergency.

It’s difficult to instil financial discipline today. Our homes are filled with things—bags, food items, gadgets, clothes, shoes. Frugality, once a guiding principle in households, has been replaced by a culture of excess.

RBI’s recently published data indicates a sharp decline of 7 percent in household savings of Indians. Yes, frugality is not just a personal financial strategy, but a societal imperative for sustainability as well. Understanding the difference between needs and wants helps curb unnecessary consumption, which adds little value to our lives.

Tamil poet-saint Thiruvalluvar, known for his wisdom on ethics and love, also gave timeless financial advice. He warned people against living beyond their means:

Alavarindhu Vaazhaadhaan Vaazhkkai Ulapola

Illagi Thondraak Kedum.

Behold the man who doesn’t live modestly within his means,

His life will appear glamorous, but will soon thin and disappear.

His words remind us that modesty is not just about money; it’s about balance. In a world obsessed with more, there is power and freedom in choosing less.

He was also sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life in May 2022 in a terror financing case probed by NIA.Yasin, in his reply-cum-affidavit to the tribunal, claimed that he was assured by “various state officials” in the early Nineties that they shall resolve the Kashmir dispute through a meaningful dialogue and that once he initiated a unilateral ceasefire, all cases against him and JKLF-Y members would be taken back. “Subsequently, a unilateral ceasefire was declared in 1994 by him and his organisation and consequently, he was provided bail in all the 32 pending militancy-related cases under TADA and, thereafter, none of the cases were pursued against him in terms of the ceasefire agreement from 1994 till 2018,” records the tribunal’s order.The JKLF-Y boss claimed that while armed militancy was the outfit’s chosen path from 1988 to 1994 to achieve its aim of establishing a United Independent Kashmir by reintegrating PoK, Gilgit, Baltistan with J&K, “after the year 1994, the said efforts were continued through a non-violent struggle”.The Centre, both in its ban notification dated March 15, 2024, as well as through depositions by officers investigating cases against JKLF-Y, maintained that though Yasin had distanced himself from armed resistance in 1994, he did not step back from supporting and sustaining terrorism. “He used his new facade to become one of the most important channels of financial resources for the violent campaign. JKLF-Y continued its anti-national activities and...played a vital role in the riots which broke out during the years 2008, 2010 and 2016,” it was submitted.Yasin sought to dismiss the charge that he had received Rs 15 lakh from terror-financing accused Zahoor Ahmad Watali as “concocted”, but the tribunal in its order noted that he had refused to comment when asked by ED the purpose of receiving this money. On NIA’s charge that he is implicated in over 89 cases of stone pelting post the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016, Yasin said he was in police custody during the violence.Though Yasin claimed JKLF-Y officers in Kashmir were closed since it was first banned in 2019, he admitted that its international branches in over 50 countries are functional and supporting the cause of the outfit. This belies his submission that there is no unlawful activity by JKLF-Y and its cadres since the 2019 ban.The tribunal, in its order confirming the ban on JKLF-Y, said there is no denial to the assertions by witnesses who deposed on behalf of the Union of India, that JKLF-Y has indulged in acts of secessionism and is still committed to secession of J&K from the Indian Union, “which directly and gravely impinges upon the territorial integrity of India”.","Yasin Malik, who founded JKLF-Y in 1988, is a prime accused in the sensational killing of four Indian Air Force personnel at Rawalpora, Srinagar, in 1990.

(PTI)

NEW DELHI: Chief of air staff (CAS) Air chief marshal Amar Preet Singh on Friday said that China is rapidly building infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), especially in the Ladakh sector.While addressing a press conference ahead of the Air Force Day, the chief of air staff also said that India too was upgrading infrastructure in the area rapidly.In response to a question, the IAF chief shared his views on China's military growth and India's preparedness in response, saying, ""We have done our analysis. We don't have a design to go offensive unnecessarily. Only when we are pushed will we be doing something. So we have our plans in place. One place we can positively say we are training much better than them. We have exposure much better than them.""Singh acknowledged that India has lagged behind China in terms of technology, and stressed the need for India to catch up in both technology and production rates. ""Because we do come to know through our sources how they train, how many different air forces they interact with and how many do we interact with. So I am very confident that as far as human angle is concerned, as far as our people behind the machine are concerned, we are way ahead of them. As far as technology is concerned, we may be not so good as of now. We have lagged. We were better than them in technology also some time back. But have lagged in that and we need to catch up with it. As far as production rates are concerned, we are way behind. We need to catch up with that. And that will happen over a period of time. It cannot happen overnight,"" Singh added.During the press conference, the air chief marshal also discussed the importance of indigenous weapons systems in tackling future security challenges amidst geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide. Singh said, ""The Indian Air Force should have entire inventory produced in India by 2047.""The IAF chief stressed the importance of domestic manufacturing capabilities, saying, ""When it comes to building the capacity, one is capability, another one is capacity. So building the capacity, it becomes important for our manufacturing agencies to come forward and increase their production rate. When it comes to conflict situations, if you are relying on getting your weapons from outside, there will always be different interests and changing interests which can create a choke point for you.""He further elaborated on the necessity of self-reliance in weapon production , and said, ""If you need to fight the war, you have to have them (weapons) being manufactured in India. You cannot afford to have them being bought and rely on that supply chain. It is imperative that we have these things being produced in India. We can't be stocking up everything forever. These things will have life. If we keep stocking up, we'll have wastage.""The most recent formal disengagement along the LAC occurred in September 2022, when both India and China withdrew troops from Patrolling Point-15 in the Gogra-Hot Springs area of Eastern Ladakh. Over the past four years, friction points such as Galwan Valley, the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, and the Gogra-Hot Springs area have seen some progress towards resolution with the establishment of buffer zones along the LAC.","Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh said that China is rapidly building infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), especially in the Ladakh sector.

Pincer move by forces took

Reds by surprise

RAIPUR: Around 28-30 Maoists were killed in fierce encounters over a 10km range in the jungles of Abujhmarh, in Bastar, on Friday. Police believe at least five senior commanders have been eliminated. It’s the biggest blow to Maoists in Bastar ever, surpassing the Kanker gunfight of April 16 in which 29 cadres were eliminated.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai and Narayanpur SP Prabhat Singh put the Maoist toll at 28, but Dantewada SP Gaurav Rai said around 30 Maoists have been killed and the final count would be known later at night.“Since it’s dark, forces are sanitising the region carefully. Collection of Naxal bodies is taking some time,” Rai said. Singh said the toll could rise. There were specific inputs about presence of at least 50 Maoists.The encounter site stretches over 10 km and gunfights took place at separate locations. There was continuous firing from 1 pm to 9 pm. It was a very courageous operation,” Narayanpur superintendent of police Prabhat Singh said.There were specific inputs about the presence of at least 50 Maoists, including cadres from PLGA Company 6, headed by commander Nandu, the Narayanpur SP said. The forces pinpointed locations in Govel, Nendur and Thulthuli villages in Orccha and Barsur areas. This densely forested region is around 300 km from Raipur and 50 km north of Dantewada. “A joint District Reserve Guards and Special Task Force team walked at least 25 km from Dantewada and Narayanpur to penetrate the Maoist den,” Singh said.The pincer movement took the Maoists completely by surprise and the first gunbattle erupted at around 1 pm. Skirmishes continued into the night, with forces pursuing the fleeing Naxals into the pitch-dark forest.Around 4 pm, the first reports of Maoist casualties came in, and by 6 pm 14 bodies had been found. The toll kept rising. Automatic weapons, including AK-47s and SLRs, and explosives have been seized. The dead Maoists are yet to be identified but, going by the weapons recovered, there could be senior commanders, say sources.“Communication with officers on the spot is difficult. Our forces are expected to return by Saturday evening,” said the Narayanpur SP.CM Vishnu Deo Sai called it a “great success”. “I salute the forces’ indomitable courage. Our fight to end Naxalism will now end only after reaching its conclusion. Our double-engine govt is committed to eliminating Naxalism,” he said.“Till now, 28 bodies have been recovered, and this seems to be one of the biggest operations so far. We have been asking Maoists to give up arms and join the mainstream. Maoism is breathing its last and very soon peace will be restored in Chhattisgarh. Union home minister Amit Shah has visited Chhattisgarh twice and he has vowed that Maoism will be eradicated by March 2026 from the country. As per his commitment, our jawans are fighting with full valour in Chhattisgarh,” he said.As many as 48 Maoists have been shot dead this year in Abujhmarh, an area once considered out of bounds for even the police.","Around 28-30 Maoists were killed in fierce encounters over a 10km range in the jungles of Abujhmarh, in Bastar, on Friday.

What is SCO?

On Saarc's revival

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar will be visiting Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) meeting scheduled to take place on October 15 and 16.""The external affairs minister will lead our delegation to Pakistan to participate in the SCO summit which will be held in Islamabad on 15 and 16 October,"" said Randhir Jaiswal, external affairs ministry spokesperson.Pakistan had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) in-person meeting, which now Jaishankar will be attending.Pakistan will be hosting the SCO meeting as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the CHG, the second highest decision-making body in the Eurasian group after the Council of Heads of State. PM Modi has been a regular at the heads of state summit, although he skipped the same in Kazakhstan this year apparently because it clashed with the Parliament session in early July.SCO is one of the few multilateral forums where India and Pakistan have managed to work together, despite the hostilities that have plagued the relationship since their abortive attempt to relaunch the dialogue process in 2015 and the terror attacks that followed.While Indian delegations have travelled to Pakistan for participation in SCO exercises and vice versa, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India last year for a meeting of SCO foreign ministers. This cooperation has been made possible by the SCO Charter that doesn't allow member-states to raise bilateral issues.The SCO is a Eurasian permanent intergovernmental international organisation created in June 2001 by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and China. The SCO was preceded by the Shanghai Five mechanism.Known as the ""alliance of the East"", the SCO is the largest regional organisation in the world in terms of geographical coverage and population, covering three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half of the human population.SCO represents around 42 per cent of the world's population and 20 per cent of the global GDP. The SCO is seen as a counter-balance to Nato, limiting the influence of United States of America (USA) in Central Asia.India was an observer state at the SCO since 2005 and was admitted as a full member of the SCO in 2017. India's membership was pushed by Russia which was aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region. However, with changes in the geopolitical realities since 2014, India aims to stay involved in the SCO to balance the growing closeness between Russia and China even as India has got closer to the US.Responding on the chances of Saarc's revival, which has remained in abeyance since 2017, Jaiswal said the government ""has given impetus to Bimstec on Saarc"".""We attach deep importance to regional cooperation, to regional connectivity. Therefore, we have given impetus to BIMSTEC on Saarc. We want to strengthen regional cooperation, but all are aware of the reason why this particular cooperation (Saarc) in that format is not moving forward. One 'particular country' has a particular way of doing things which is stalling Saarc,"" he said.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar will be visiting Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) meeting scheduled to take place on October 15 and 16.

""My 24-year-old son is unable to get a job even after earning a degree.""Asked if she will cast her vote if there's no hope from any political parties , the resident of Dabla village, Sirsa, says: ""Ib ghar beth ke bhi ke kara (What will I do sitting at home [on polling day)?""Many from the lower castes share the sense of disillusionment.""We are living in our own homes like tenants. We are paying for all amenities, getting nothing from the govt,"" says Promila, a cleaner in Rohtak belonging to the Scheduled Caste community.She shows little enthusiasm for the elections. ""I do not feel like voting. Neither Modi nor Rahul Gandhi cares about uplifting us,"" she says. Despite this, she admits, ""I've always voted for BJP.""""It is usually my brother-in-law who tells me who to vote for,"" adds the 42-year-old widow who like many women in the state, notorious for its patriarchal values, depends on male family members to decide her vote.Another OBC voter Sooraj Prakash, 38, a resident of Shahidanwali village in Sirsa, says: ""We want change.

While they may feel their votes don't matter, their choices are crucial.

NEW DELHI: For the first time in nine years, an Indian foreign minister will travel to Pakistan with the govt confirming Friday that S Jaishankar will represent India at the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.TOI had first reported on Aug 25 that Pakistan had invited PM Modi for the meeting. However, with Modi’s participation in SCO restricted to the heads of state summit, the key question always was whether he would nominate Jaishankar, who has participated in the same meetings in the past.India also had the option to send a junior minister or participate virtually.Foreign minister Jaishankar's visit to Pakistan later this month, although it's for SCO summit and can't be seen as a peace outreach, opens the possibility of a rare high-level visit from India to Islamabad at a time when ties remain downgraded since the revocation of special status of J&K in Aug 2019.The decision to send Jaishankar is significant as India had the option of sending a junior minister or participating virtually. Jaishankar had said recently that India is not passive on Pakistan and will react accordingly to both positive and negative developments. Whether or not there's a bilateral meeting with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar is likely to depend more on the host.India's last high commissioner to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, said the ball is now firmly in Pakistan's court as by sending Jaishankar India has made a bold move, signalling its desire to stabilise this troubled relationship. ""Pakistan must seize this opportunity and as the host propose a meaningful bilateral conversation on SCO sidelines. A good starting point for both countries would be to grab some low-hanging fruit - exchanging high commissioners and reviving trade ties,"" he said.While announcing Jaishankar's participation, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the visit was about SCO and not much should be read into it. The visit also underscores the significance India attaches to the Eurasian bloc.Despite the Chinese predominance, and efforts to position it as an anti-West forum, SCO remains an important platform for India to build ties with resource-rich central Asia and address issues related to regional security and assert its strategic autonomyInterestingly, as foreign secretary, Jaishankar had accompanied then Union foreign minister Sushma Swaraj when she visited Pakistan in 2015 for Heart of Asia - Istanbul Process talks.",S Jaishankar will represent India at the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.

""We have to catch up with them,"" Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said, speaking in the run-up to the IAF Day on Oct 8.""We have done our analysis. We don't have a design to go on an offensive unnecessarily. Only when we are pushed will we do something,"" he said, adding that IAF has its operational plans in place to tackle any contingency.Acknowledging that IAF was grappling with a depleting number of fighter squadrons, which is down to just 30 when 42 are authorized, ACM Singh added, ""We are focusing on fighting with whatever we have... so training becomes very important. Should we be required to contest with somebody, we should be able to win.""China has deployed additional jets, including its most advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at its airfields facing India like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping after upgrading them with new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities.This somewhat offsets the terrain constraints China faces at its airbases due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft. Overall, China has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.ACM Singh said China is rapidly building infrastructure, but India too is constructing new airfields, which include the high-altitude Nyoma one in eastern Ladakh, and strengthening capacity of existing airbases to handle more aircraft.Plans are also afoot to take over or use civil advance landing grounds (ALGs) in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), after upgrading ALGs in eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.""It's important for our manufacturing agencies to increase their production rate,"" ACM Singh said.

We can't rely on only one production agency,"" he said.IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. It is yet to get the first ""improved"" Tejas Mark-1A jet of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021. Another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore are also going to be ordered soon.Then, IAF plans to induct at least six squadrons (108 jets) of Tejas Mark-2, with a longer combat range and greater weapon-carrying capacity. In August 2022, the PM-led cabinet committee on security had cleared the over Rs 9,000 crore development cost for Tejas Mark-2 with more powerful GE-F414 engines, and the first test-flight is slated for October next year.

Dalrymple criticises British Musuem exhibition 'Silk Roads' for ‘excluding’ India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalrymple-criticises-british-musuem-exhibition-silk-roads-for-excluding-india/articleshow/113949562.cms,"Ceramic figure of a lute player (Credit: Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford)

LONDON: Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum featuring over 300 objects from the Silk Roads from CE 500 to CE 1000 for excluding India.Speaking to TOI from London after visiting the show, Dalrymple said he was shocked India was excluded given that India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period.The exhibition “Silk Roads”, which opened last week, claims to “challenge the popular concept of the Silk Road as a single trade route, instead showing how the Silk Roads were made up of overlapping networks.”“Hanging from the ceiling in a single corridor are various location names — it covers almost all of Asia, except India, and it seems so bizarre, because India was the largest trading partner of the Roman empire,” the author said.“When you are trying to present the trade routes of the ancient world and do all the minor sites of international trade and miss out the biggest trading partner where east-west trade took place in its greatest quantity, it is bizarre, particularly when you open the exhibition with a Buddha from Swat and end with a purse containing Rajasthani garnets,” he said.“They acknowledge these garnets, but there is no display for India which should be at the heart of the show. It ends up being a bizarre omission, almost inexplicable, to anyone that knows the centrality of India to ancient trade networks,” he added, pointing out not one Roman coin horde has ever been found in China, yet Roman coin hordes are found in India every year.India was the greatest trading partner with Rome of the classical world, while China and Rome had only the very faintest impression of each other’s existence, Dalrymple said.This is a theme of his book, ""The Golden Road”, in which he argues this notion of an East-West overland route linking China with the Mediterranean, the so-called Silk Road, is a myth which grew out of a Sino-centric reframing of history. “Silk was not even the biggest product imported from the East; pepper from India was,” he said.“India has a haunting presence throughout the exhibition,” Dalrymple said.Buddhism is a central feature, even if the exhibition misses out the home of Buddhism, India.“Nalanda doesn’t feature at all,” he said. “Yet this was the period when the Buddhist monks were coming from Japan and China to Nalanda.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “We don’t recognise the characterisation made by Dalrymple. The exhibition goes beyond the narrow 19th-century definition of the Silk Road to present a richer, more complex story of the Silk Roads as overlapping networks.”“Maps in the exhibition and accompanying book also refer to sites from India. For instance, a map showing the probable route of the 9th century ship that sank off the coast of Indonesia, near the island of Belitung, recognises that the vessel most likely stopped at ports along the coast of the Indian subcontinent,” the spokesperson said, adding, “Objects featured throughout the exhibition point to the importance of India in the trade of goods and the transmission of knowledge.”“The game of chess is noted as an invention in India probably around 500 CE and is represented by the world’s oldest group of chess pieces, made from elephant ivory probably sourced from India,” the spokesperson said.",Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum for excluding India. India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period. The exhibition “Silk Roads” claims to “challenge the popular concept of the Silk Road as a single trade route”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113949555,imgsize-567372,width-400,resizemode-4/113949555.jpg"
"Polls no solution to Kashmir issue, talks only way forward: Mirwaiz Umar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/polls-no-solution-to-kashmir-issue-talks-only-way-forward-mirwaiz-umar/articleshow/113949479.cms,"SRINAGAR: Neither guns, nor elections could bring a solution to the Kashmir issue , Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said Friday, asserting that dialogue was the only way to resolve the issue for achieving everlasting peace.In his sermon after the Friday prayers at Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, Kashmir’s chief cleric, while recalling talks with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani and Manmohan Singh, said Hurriyat had always advocated meaningful dialogue for permanent settlement of the Kashmir issue, but claimed “there was no seriousness on the other side”.Hurriyat did not want to see guns in the hands of youth as the “Kashmir conflict” had already consumed three generations, he noted.Addressing the congregation, Mirwaiz maintained that Hurriyat was never against election in J&K, but against it being projected as a solution to what he termed a longstanding “dispute”. The separatist outfit, which has in the past issued poll boycott calls, desisted from doing so this time around. Elections, however, “can’t be misconstrued as the settlement of the Kashmir issue”, he said.“The reality is that assembly or Lok Sabha elections are only for resolution for day-to-day issues like ‘sadak, bijli and paani (road, electricity and water). The large issue, which is the political dispute, remains there,” he added.Warning against a potential escalation, Mirwaiz referred to the situation in West Asia and hoped the Kashmir issue would be resolved “before it takes an ugly turn and the shape of a war”.He took a swipe at J&K’s mainstream parties and their leaders, saying they claimed to be contesting the elections to protect the rights of people. “Had they really been serious, they would have fought unitedly,” Mirwaiz said.Mirwaiz also brought up the abrogation of Article 370 , saying “our political rights were snatched and we lost our control on land rights, jobs and what not”.Asserting that the “iron fist policy will not work”, he said the Govt of India must come to the table for talks. “Hurriyat leadership may be in jail or under detention. Many of them are booked under PSA and many under UAPA. But, the fact remains that Hurriyat continues to represent the genuine aspirations and sentiments of people of Kashmir,” he said.He also sought answers from the J&K administration as to why the historic Jamia Masjid was closed on important religious occasions such as Shab-e-Qadr, Rabi-ul Awal, Jumat-ul-Vida etc. “Can’t you see how people of Kashmir cooperate when there are religious festivals of other communities. Don’t you see how we cooperate to make Amarnath Yatra a grand success? Why is Jamia being locked and prayers disallowed when there are special Muslim rituals?” he asked.","Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said Hurriyat had always advocated meaningful dialogue for permanent settlement of the Kashmir issue. He claimed “there was no seriousness on the other side’. Elections, however, “can’t be misconstrued as the settlement of Kashmir issue”, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113949477,imgsize-1053775,width-400,resizemode-4/113949477.jpg"

SC constitutes new SIT to probe Tirupati laddu row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-constitutes-new-sit-to-probe-tirupati-laddu-row/articleshow/113948934.cms,"SC: Need independent probe to assuage feelings of crores

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday replaced the Andhra Pradesh govt-appointed special investigation team with a new SIT comprising officers from CBI, Andhra Pradesh Police and Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to probe alleged adulteration of the famous laddu prasadam of Tirupati.""If there is substance in the allegations, it is a very serious matter but we will not allow the court to be made a political battleground,"" a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said.It replaced the TDP govt-appointed SIT with one that will comprise two officers each from CBI and the state police and an FSSAI officer. The probe will be monitored by the CBI director, the bench ordered.Five PILs were filed in SC shortly after AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Sept 18 alleged, based on a laboratory report, that ghee used in the preparation of laddu prasadam contained animal fat. Disposal of petitions by SC means the SIT need not submit its report to the court and it will have to be acted upon by the state govt.The SC bench said though there was no doubting the ability of the state-appointed SIT, an independent one was required as the allegations in the FIR had “the potential of hurting sentiments of crores of devotees of Lord Venkateswara residing worldwide”.The proceedings saw sharp exchanges between senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for AP govt, and Sidharth Luthra, for Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Board, on one side and senior advocate Kapil Sibal and Subramanian Swamy on the other side demanding an independent probe.Responding to the court’s query regarding the Centre’s stand on the controversy, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “If there is any element of truth in the allegations, it is unacceptable.” He said the Centre did not have anything against the state-appointed SIT, whose officers were competent and capable to probe the controversy. He suggested that if the court wished, the Centre would depute a senior officer to supervise the probe.The bench asked Rohatgi whether there was conclusive proof with the chief minister to make that statement on adulteration of prasadam. Rohatgi said according to the govt, there was conclusive proof and the SIT should be allowed to unearth the truth. “In question is the quality of ghee supplied by a contractor on two days — July 6 and 12 — and whether these contained animal fat,” he said. Sibal claimed that the ghee had vegetable fat, not animal fat.Justice Viswanathan said the TTD Board chairman was on record that these two consignments were not used in the preparation of prasadam. Luthra said, “The shrine on the hill is sacrosanct. Nothing tainted can come there. The tankers on these two days were tested on the hill and found to be contaminated.” Sibal asked, “If the hill is sacrosanct, why were the tankers allowed to go to the hill?”The bench said, “Fortunately or unfortunately, both sides are warring groups. We do not want any political drama in the court.”In its order, the SC said, “We clarify that we have not gone into the allegations and counter-allegations of the petitioners or the state govt. We clarify that we will not permit the court to be used as a political battleground. However, to assuage the feelings of crores of people, we find that investigation should be conducted by an independent SIT consisting of representatives of state police, CBI and a representative of FSSAI. It will also be appropriate that the investigation is carried under the supervision of the CBI director.”“We clarify that our order should not be construed as any reflection on the independence and fairness of officers of the (state-appointed) SIT. We are constituting an independent SIT only to assuage the feelings of crores of people having faith in the deity. We dispose of the petitions.”","Five PILs were filed in SC shortly after AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu alleged, based on a laboratory report, that ghee used in the preparation of laddu prasadam contained animal fat.

(File photo)

NEW DELHI: Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu will travel to India from October 6-10 on a state visit , ministry of external affairs (MEA) said on Friday.""President of the Republic of Maldives Mohamed Muizzu will be travelling to India on a state visit. This will be his first bilateral visit to India. He had earlier visited India, in June 2024 to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the PM and council of ministers.During his visit, he will also be in Bengaluru and Mumbai where he will have business engagements ,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during the weekly press briefing.During his visit to India, President Muizzu will meet President Droupadi Murmu and hold discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on ""bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest,"" MEA said in a press release.This will be President Muizzu's second visit to India this year, following the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June.It is notable that while previous Maldivian presidents typically made their first foreign visit to India, President Mohamed Muizzu broke with tradition by choosing to visit Turkey and China first after taking office.Since assuming power, Muizzu has taken several unconventional steps in the context ofIndia-Maldives relations . His presidential campaign was heavily centered around the 'India Out' movement, with a key promise being the removal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.Within hours after taking oath as Maldivian president in November 2023, Muizzu demanded that India replace the defence personnel it had stationed in the Maldives with civilians.Following a diplomatic row in January, when three Maldivian deputy ministers made derogatory comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Lakshadweep when he had called for the Indian island cluster to be developed as a destination for beach tourism and promotion of domestic tourism, the Maldivian government recently adopted a conciliatory tone. The issue escalated into a major diplomatic dispute, with New Delhi summoning the Maldivian envoy and strongly protesting the viral posts. The three deputy ministers were later suspended.Since January, the Muizzu-led government has made many efforts to restore the relationship, including several high-level visits, such as the President himself attending Prime Minister Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony and the Maldivian foreign minister's visit to India.","Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu will travel to India from October 6-10.

The SIT was also halted which was formed by CM. The sanctity of TTD and prasadam was damaged by Chandrababu Naidu's false comments. Even the courts questioned CM Chandrababu Naidu for making allegations on TTD,"" former Andhra Pradesh CM said.""Even after the court order, he (CM Naidu) should feel ashamed for spreading false news... He is spreading blatant lies. I don't understand why he is posting on social media that the Supreme Court expressed anger toward YSRCP. The tankers were sent back 14 times during their regime (2014 to 2019). A robust system has been implemented in TTD for manufacturing prasadam. Tankers are not allowed to enter for utilization without passing quality checks. Three tests are to be conducted before the product is used. If a tanker fails to qualify in even a single test, it will be sent back without being used,"" Reddy added.Earlier, the apex court in a stern remark said that it can not be used as a ""political battleground"" while replacing the state govt SIT formed on September 26 with the court-appointed panel to investigate the sensitive issue.The independent SIT will be composed of two officials each from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Andhra Pradesh Police, as well as a senior official from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The bench, consisting of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan, directed that the investigation should be conducted under the supervision of the CBI Director.The bench, during the hearing, said that they do not want this matter to be turned into a political drama, acknowledging the sentiments of millions of people worldwide.The controversy arose earlier this month when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu claimed that animal fat was used in making Tirupati laddus during the previous Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government in the state.However, the YSR Congress Party accused Naidu of making ""heinous allegations"" for political gains, while the ruling Telugu Desam Party circulated a laboratory report to support its claim.The apex court had earlier questioned Chief Minister Naidu's public statement regarding the alleged use of animal fat in making Tirupati laddus under the previous Reddy-led regime.The court observed that the laboratory test report was unclear and prima facie indicated that ""rejected ghee"" was tested.The bench noted that the Chief Minister's statement was made on September 18, even before the FIR was lodged on September 25 and the SIT was constituted on September 26. The court expressed its prima facie view that it was inappropriate for a high constitutional functionary to make a public statement that could affect the sentiments of millions of people while an investigation was underway.","YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy hits back at Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

Historian and a professor at University of Cincinnati , Shailaja Paik has received a $800,000 ""genius"" grant from Mc Arthur Foundation for writing about challenges faced by the Dalit women in the country. The foundation gives out award every year to people with extraordinary achievements or potential.""Through her focus on the multifaceted experiences of Dalit women, Paik elucidates the enduring nature of caste discrimination and the forces that perpetuate untouchability,"" said the Foundation while announcing the fellowship.A distinguished research professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, Paik is also an affiliate faculty in Women's , Gender and Sexuality Studies and Asian studies.Shailaja's groundbreaking story is an inspiration for many. Hailing from Pune's Yerwada slum, Paik outlawed caste discrimination and made her way from tin slums of Siddharth Nagar in Pune's Yerwada to the distinguished halls of University of Warwick where she completed her doctorate. She got her masters' degree from the Savitribai Phule University in Pune. Paik is only one of 10 MacArthur Fellows to be named in Ohio and the first ever in both the city of Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati since the award began in 1981.She told UC news that she just poured herself into academics — education and employment were the magic wands to escape the slum, she added.""Paik provides new insight into the history of caste domination and traces the ways in which gender and sexuality are used to deny Dalit women dignity and personhood,"" the Foundation said.Paik grew up in the city of Pune with her three sisters in a 20-by-20-foot room. She recalled how her house did not have a regular water supply or a private toilet. She told UC news that she grew up with garbage and dirt around her, and pigs roaming the alleys. She described that she is still traumatized by the memories of the public toilets.She told UC News that she remembered carrying large vessels of water for cleaning and cooking on her head from the city public water tap.She added that all this had a very deep impact — socially, educationally, emotionally, psychologically. She threw light on Dalit lives through her books. The author launched her first book in 2014 titled ""Dalit Women’s Education in Modern India: Double Discrimination,"" which highlights the challenges faced by Dalit women in Maharashtra. Her second book, ""The Vulgarity of Caste: Dalits, Sexuality, and Humanity in Modern India,"" discusses the lives of Maharashtra’s Tamasha artists, many of whom are Dalit women.Deoram F. Paik prioritized an English education for his children to create better opportunities for their future. His wife, Sarita Paik, took measures to protect her children, ensuring that the dangers of their environment did not affect them. She told UC News, “My mother, Sarita Paik, also protected her and her sisters, making sure that the dangers of their environment didn’t interfere.”Professor Paik, a scholar at the University of California, has received several prestigious awards throughout her career. Recently, she was honored as a MacArthur Fellow. Her accolades also include the Frederick Burkhardt Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Stanford Humanities Center Fellowship, the American Institute of Indian Studies Fellowship, and the Luce Foundation Fellowship. She has also received the 2023 John F. Richards Prize and the Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy Prize for her book ""The Vulgarity of Caste: Dalits, Sexuality and Humanity in Modern India,"" published by Stanford University Press in 2022.The funding from these awards will support Paik's ongoing research and writing. She explained, “This funding will allow me to continue my research and writing, helping educate others and creating documentation about the lives of the Dalits and the caste system.”","Indian-American professor Shailaja Paik receives US Genius Grant on Dalit studies.

MANAUS: One of the Amazon River 's main tributaries has dropped to its lowest level ever recorded, Brazil's geological service said on Friday, reflecting a severe drought that has devastated the Amazon rainforest and other parts of the country. The level of the Negro river at the port of Manaus was at 12.66 metres on Friday, as compared with a normal level of about 21 metres.It is the lowest since measurements started 122 years ago. The previous record low level was recorded last year, but toward the end of October.The Negro river's water level might drop even more in coming weeks based on forecasts for low rainfall in upstream regions, according to the geological service's predictions. Andre Martinelli, the agency's hydrology manager in Manaus, was quoted as saying the river was expected to continue receding until the end of the month.Water levels in Brazil's Amazon always rise and fall with its rainy and dry seasons, but the dry portion of this year has been much worse than usual. All of the major rivers in the Amazon basin are at critical levels, including the Madeira River, the Amazon River's longest tributary.The Negro River drains about 10 per cent of the Amazon basin and is the world's sixth-largest by water volume. Manaus, the biggest city in the rainforest, is where the Negro joins the Amazon river.For locals, the drought has made basic daily activities impossible. Gracita Barbosa, 28, works as a cashier on a floating shop on the Negro river. She is out of work because boats that once stopped there can no longer navigate the river due to the low water levels. Barbosa can no longer bathe in the river and now has to travel longer distances to collect drinking water.","The level of the Negro river at the port of Manaus was at 12.66 metres on Friday, as compared with a normal level of about 21 metres.

This Bible is commonly referred to as the Trump Bible as Trump endorsed them. They cost $60 each online, with Trump receiving fees for his endorsement, the report said.In June, Oklahoma state superintendent Ryan Walters announced all classrooms must teach the Bible in its courses. Walters released guidelines in August instructing schools to teach the Bible in its ""historical, cultural, and literary context."" Several local districts said they won't change their curriculum.Trump started selling Bibles during this election cycle in the face of mounting legal bills. “Happy Holy Week! Let’s Make America Pray Again. As we lead into Good Friday and Easter, I encourage you to get a copy of the God Bless the USA Bible,” Trump wrote announcing the sale of Trump Bible for $59.99.""This. Is. Criminal. Requiring religious material in the classroom is unconstitutional, anti-American and illegal. Period. Note the “Trump Bible” only has 10 Amendments. Also, this is literally using taxpayer dollars for a political campaign. This cannot be allowed in America,"" a social media user wrote.""The right-wing christian nationalist OK Schools Chief has devised a scheme to not only force Bible study into public schools, but also to try and purchase 55,000 overpriced Trump Bibles with public education dollars,"" Ron Filipkowski wrote. ""There is literally only one Bible sold in America that meets this criteria & that is Trump’s Bible. So Ryan Walters is trying to send millions in tax dollars intended for school kids into Trump’s pocket. MAGA is an organized crime syndicate where they all kick up to the boss,"" Filipkowski added.","Department of Education Oklahoma bidding for supply of 55,000 Bibles.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Flight slams brakes mid-takeoff to avoid collision with crossing plane: 'Stopped so quickly',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/flight-slams-brakes-mid-takeoff-to-avoid-collision-with-crossing-plane-stopped-so-quickly/articleshow/113953863.cms,"A London-bound flight from John F Kennedy International Airport was forced to abort takeoff and hit breaks mid-way on Thursday to avoid colliding with another plane on the runway, according to a report by The New York Post.Norse Atlantic Airways Flight Z0702 was accelerating for departure when the pilots had to slam on the brakes due to what the airline described as a “potential obstruction on the runway.” According to a Norse steward, the obstruction was another plane preparing for takeoff from an intersecting runway.FlightRadar24 data showed the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner reaching 87 knots (100 mph) before abruptly slowing down and turning left back onto the taxiway.One passenger, Angela Blevins, said the stop was sudden but did not cause panic. ""No one really screamed, except maybe a few sudden utterances because we stopped so quickly,"" Angela told the New York Post. ""It didn’t feel like a crash or that we were in danger.""A Norse Atlantic flight attendant, who spoke anonymously, downplayed the situation, noting that the other plane was at the far end of the crossing runway. ""JFK is very busy, you look both ways before crossing.""In a statement, Norse Atlantic Airways called the incident minor, stressing that the safety of passengers and crew was never in jeopardy. “Our pilots are highly trained for such events,” the airline said.The plane took off again shortly afterward, landing safely at London’s Gatwick Airport six hours later.","Norse Atlantic Airways Flight Z0702 was accelerating for departure when the pilots had to slam on the brakes.
