8th Pay Commission: How much salary hike to expect?

8th Pay Commission: What is the fitment factor?

The fitment factor serves as a multiplication coefficient employed to determine the revised compensation for central government staff and retirees. It represents an essential element of the Pay Commission, utilised when implementing salary and pension increases following new commission guidelines.

The variation in grade pay assessment and irregular spacing between pay bands directly influences the quantum of fitment benefits. This inconsistency led numerous stakeholders to advocate for the implementation of a uniform fitment factor applicable across all employee categories.

The 7th Pay Commission established a standard fitment benefit of 2.57 applicable to all central government employees. This factor resulted in raising the minimum basic pay to ""Rs 18,000"" monthly from the previous ""Rs. 7,000"" (2.57 times the basic remuneration under the 6th Pay Commission).

A practical demonstration helps explain how public sector workers can determine their revised salary using the fitment factor set by the 8th Pay Commission. Consider a scenario where your current basic pay is Rs 40,000 monthly, and let’s assume that the 8th Pay Commission suggests a fitment factor of 2.5. This calculation would raise your basic salary to Rs 1 lakh per month.

Initially, dearness allowance remains excluded, as per typical pay commission guidelines. The dearness allowance component gets incorporated into the salary structure during subsequent years, following pay commission recommendations. Additional allowances might undergo modifications based on the pay commission's directives.

8th Pay Commission latest news : In good news for central government employees, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission. With this, central government employees can look forward to a salary hike.PM Modi shared on X: ""We are all proud of the efforts of all Government employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on the 8th Pay Commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption.""The decision comes months after the dearness allowance for central government employees crossed 50% of central government employees' basic salary. From July 1, 2024, central government staff and pensioners have been receiving 53% of their basic pay as dearness allowance/relief, with the next adjustment scheduled for January 2025.The current salary structure, based on the 7th Pay Commission's guidelines implemented from January 1, 2016, will be updated after the 8th Pay Commission recommendations. ET consulted experts regarding potential salary increases, considering historical pay commission recommendations.Krishnendu Chatterjee, TeamLease Vice President, was quoted as saying, ""The Last Pay Commission was established in 2016, which recommended the minimum pay jump from 7,000 per month to 18,000 per month with a fitment factor of 2.57 times of basic pay. The maximum ceiling is 2.5 lakhs per month. Considering the inflation factor, there are indications that the fitment factor may stay between 2.5- 2.8 times, which will give a significant boost to employee salaries between Rs 40,000 and Rs 45,000. There are also suggestions of Performance based pay hike which are still under deliberation.""Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: Cabinet approves constitution of 8th Pay Commission; central government employees eye pay hike According to Rohitaashv Sinha from King Stubb & Kasiva, ""Pay commissions are in most cases established every 10 years to assess and provide changes to the remunerations of central government employees. The last pay commission, i.e. the 7th pay commission took effect in January 2016 and gave a raise on the minimum basic pay from Rs 7000 to Rs 18000 using the fitment factor 2.57. In the 8th Pay Commission, it is believed that the increase the minimum basic pay will be an astonishing 186%. This may make the minimum basic pay to INR 51,480 per month. It seems that the fitment factor for it is 2.86. The changes are likely to be implemented through the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2025 and may lead to enhanced pension and other retiral benefits such as EPF, Gratuity etc. and recommend changes in salary structures for government employees.""SKV Law Offices' Senior Associate Nihal Bhardwaj explains that historical data suggests central government staff might receive a 25-30% pay rise under the 8th Pay Commission. The 6th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2006, covering the period 2006–2016) utilised a 1.86 fitment factor, delivering a 40% increase in wages, whilst the 7th Pay Commission (Effective from January 1, 2016, covering the period 2016–2026) employed a 2.57 fitment factor, yielding approximately 23-25% higher salaries.Staff associations are currently pushing for a fitment factor between 3.0 and 3.5, which could potentially elevate the minimum basic salary from Rs 18,000 to roughly Rs 25,000–Rs 26,000. Such adjustments would result in substantial improvements across all pay grades, he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has given its nod for the constitution of the 8th Pay Commission.

Fasting farm leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Saturday agreed to take medical aid in what appeared to be a flicker of hope towards a breakthrough in a year-long standoff.Farmer leader Sukhjit Singh Hardojhande confirmed to news agency PTI that Dallewal agreed to take medical aid, even as the central government extended a proposal to protesting farmers.Dallewal, the convener of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political), has lost 20 kg during his fast and is in critical condition. Refusing medical intervention, he has become the symbolic face of the protest, which centres on demands for a legal guarantee of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops.Adding urgency to the situation, 10 more farmers joined the hunger strike on Saturday, raising the total number of fasting protesters to 121. Kotra reported that one of the strikers vomited blood, highlighting the dire state of their health.Earlier, Kaka Singh Kotra, another farm leader, confirmed receiving the proposal, saying, ""Leaders of both forums are discussing it, and we will respond soon."" However, the contents of the proposal remain undisclosed.This development follows a two-hour meeting between Union agriculture ministry officials, led by joint secretary Priya Ranjan, and farmer representatives. Ranjan also visited the ailing farmer leader, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, whose indefinite hunger strike has now entered its 54th day. “We urged him to accept medical aid and break his fast to participate in the February 14 meeting in Chandigarh,” Ranjan told reporters.Farmers under the banners of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha have been camping at the Punjab-Haryana border since February 13, 2023. Denied permission to march to Delhi, they have stood firm, pressing for their demands despite four inconclusive rounds of talks with the Centre last year.","Jagjit Singh Dallewal has lost 20 kg during his fast and is in critical condition.

'Deleting names a bid to fight

caste prejudice

'

NEW DELHI: The Haryana government has asked the Centre to remove certain caste names from the state list of Scheduled Castes because they are “objectionable”, a reference to the caste appellations that are widely viewed as pejorative and also serve as slurs from supremacists.The names sought to be deleted are ‘Chura’ and ‘Bhangi’, which are mentioned at serial no. 2 of the SC list, and ‘Mochi’, which is listed at serial no. 9 of the SC list.Sources said the state, in a letter this month, has argued that the names are “not only objectionable but have lost relevance as well”.The letter states that Haryana reviewed the list of SCs and zeroed in on the three names as worthy of being deleted.It is learnt that Haryana (social justice, empowerment, welfare of SCs and BCs, and Antyodaya department) has claimed that it had sent a similar request in Aug 2013, but its fate is not known. Sources, however, said there is no record of the earlier letter having been received by the ministry of social justice and empowerment . The fresh letter is being examined by the ministry, sources added.From the state’s perspective, the move appears designed to remove from official and public parlance names, which, though rooted in traditional occupations identified with social groups, have turned into convenient instruments of prejudice. When hurled with a negative and derisive connotation, they often form part of caste prejudice complained about under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, that carries stringent provisions of punishment.However, for such a request for deletion to be carried out, the Centre will have to amend the Constitution (SCs) Order, 1950, as is done for inclusion and exclusion of castes from the lists of SCs and STs.","The Haryana government has asked the Centre to remove certain caste names from the state list of Scheduled Castes.

Modi blames earlier governments for people not having land deeds

NEW DELHI: Legal property cards under Svamitva scheme will unleash the economic power of land parcels, sometimes referred to as ‘dead capital’, since these can be monetised to get loans for business and education, and help in poverty alleviation, PM Modi said on Saturday as he virtually distributed over 65 lakh such cards to people.Property cards were distributed to beneficiaries across more than 50,000 villages in 10 states — Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, MP, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, UP and two UTs of J&K, and Ladakh — in a single day. Referring to a famous economist, the PM said that he had referred to property as “dead capital” because people could not monetise them.Property rights is a major challenge across the world. Years ago, United Nations had held a study, which revealed people did not have legal documents for property rights in several countries. UN has said property rights are important for poverty alleviation,” Modi said.The PM said India was also impacted by this challenge and people in villages had property worth lakhs of crores of rupees, but they did not have papers for it. “There were disputes, powerful people would take control illegally, and even banks did not provide loans,” he added.Lashing out at earlier governments, Modi said no sensitive government could leave its villagers in such distress. “Previous governments should have taken steps to do something about it but nothing much was done,” he said.Modi said after receiving legal documents under the Svamitva scheme, which started five years ago, lakhs of people have taken loans from banks based on their properties and started small businesses in their villages. Earlier, the PM had interacted with some of the beneficiaries and all of them had highlighted how getting a loan based on the property document was easy and they could use this for their business and higher education of their children.The PM said many such people are farmers, for whom this property card is a guarantee to financial security. He added that once property cards are issued in all villages, the scheme will unlock economic activities worth over Rs 100 lakh crore. Modi said the digitisation of land records, which is now around 98%, will minimise land disputes and corruption. Later, in a post on X, he said rural land digitisation is “furthering rural empowerment by leveraging the power of technology and good governance”.Panchayati raj minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’ said property rights cards are issued in many states in the name of women as main or co-owners, which is empowering for them.","Property cards were distributed to beneficiaries across more than 50,000 villages in 10 states.

Poll How do you feel about the distribution of property cards under the SVAMITVA Scheme? Advances the Use of Technology in Rural Areas Improves Rural Property Management and Ownership

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday distributed over 65 lakh property cards under the SVAMITVA Scheme to property owners in over 50,000 villages. These villages span more than 230 districts across 10 states and 2 UTs.PM Modi virtually addressed the event held in Ahmedabad and also interacted with the beneficiaries. BJP national president and union minister JP Nadda was also present at the event.The scheme was launched on April 24, 2020 (On National Panchayati Raj Day) by PM Modi, to provide a ""Record of Rights"" to property owners in rural Abadi areas using drone and GIS technology.Addressing the event, PM said, ""Today is a very historic day for the villages of the country and for the rural economy of the country. Around 2.24 crore people in villages will now have Svamitva property cards after 65 lakh cards are distributed today”.Speaking on the importance of the scheme, PM said, “We desire the development and trust of everyone, which is why we launched the SVAMITVA scheme. We decided that with the help of drones, we would map the land of homes in every village. Villagers will receive documents of their properties”.“Today, as we see the benefits of this scheme, it brings satisfaction to know we have been able to serve the villages and the poor...The joy, contentment, and self-confidence seen on the faces of the beneficiaries is truly heartwarming. I consider this a great blessing”, PM further added.PM Modi also highlighted the critical issue of property rights, emphasising its impact on global poverty reduction. Citing a United Nations study, he noted that many countries lack proper legal documentation for land ownership, creating disputes and diminishing the value of properties.He stated that India, too, faced similar challenges, with rural properties often lacking clear legal titles, leading to conflicts and exploitation by influential individuals.PM also underscored the need for robust property rights to unlock economic potential, reduce disputes, and ensure equitable ownership, framing it as a key step toward addressing poverty and fostering development.Under the initiative of SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas), the Government is providing accurate property ownership data, with clear ownership records in hand, thereby, land disputes have been reduced.The program also assists in the monetisation of properties and allows for institutional financing through bank loans. It also aids in minimising property-related conflicts; enhances the evaluation of properties and property taxes in rural regions, and supports thorough planning at the village level.BJP president Nadda also shared his thoughts on the event and said, ""Before discussing the SVAMITVA plan, we should keep one thing in mind in a holistic approach under the leadership of PM Modi, the program of empowerment of the common man has been given great importance. When we talk about empowerment, our focus has been on villages, the poor, the Dalits, the exploited, the afflicted, the deprived, the youth, women, farmers etc... All programmes have been planned to keep all these in mind. Under the leadership of Modi ji, work has been done keeping in mind the mantra of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas',"" he said.The program has achieved complete saturation in the regions of Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tripura, Goa, Uttarakhand, and Haryana. Drone surveys have been finalised in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh, as well as in various Union Territories.","PM Modi virtually addressed the event held in Ahmedabad and also interacted with the beneficiaries.

DEHRADUN: Indian Medical Association (IMA) is against the integration of alternative medicine systems with modern medicine , said Dr Dilip Bhanushali , the newly appointed president of IMA, during the installation ceremony of the medical body’s fresh office bearers in Dehradun on Saturday.Bhanushali described the practice of mixopathy as a “menace”, emphasising that “80% of alternative practitioners continue to prescribe modern medicines despite a Supreme Court directive prohibiting such practices”. He said: “We are not against ayurveda , homeopathy , or other sciences. Let them practice their respective systems. What we oppose is mixing them, as it leads to results that are not helpful.”Bhanushali further warned that promotion of mixopathy would promote quackery . “Practitioners who lack formal training in modern medicine might prescribe harmful treatments, including high-dose steroids and antibiotics, to patients who are unaware of their potential side effects,” he said.Highlighting the rigorous training modern surgeons undergo, spanning eight to 10 years, Bhanushali questioned how short-term training could equip practitioners of ayurveda or homeopathy to perform complex medical procedures. “How can you simply train ayurveda, homeopathy or Unani doctors for one year and allow them to perform duties equivalent to a surgeon? Will they do justice to their patients?” he said.","Indian Medical Association (IMA) is against the integration of alternative medicine systems with modern medicine.

KOLKATA: Former colleagues of a 31-year-old resident doctor, raped and murdered at RG Kar Medical College on Aug 9 last year, expressed deep disappointment with the verdict delivered by the Sealdah trial court Saturday. The court convicted main accused Sanjay Roy , but many felt the investigation and proceedings had not been thorough.Several junior doctors were present at the court. “We are disheartened with this kind of shoddy investigation . We will be rallying behind the parents until complete justice is delivered,” said Arnab Mukhopadhyay, a junior doctor who had participated in hunger strikes demanding justice.Members of Medical Service Centre, Service Doctors’ Forum, and Joint Platform of Doctors gathered near the court, expressing dissatisfaction with the handling of the case. “We knew Roy would be pronounced guilty. We are here to remind the agencies that the investigation has not been done properly,” said Utpal Banerjee, an orthopaedic professor. “The court verdict did not address the involvement of others and those who tampered with evidence,” said Sajal Biswas of Service Doctors’ Forum.West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front (WBJDF) distributed leaflets highlighting 20 unanswered questions about the case. “We will be happy only when complete justice is delivered. We will be considering legal options like moving to a higher court and other forms of protest to remind everyone that justice is not done until all guilty are punished,” said Asfakulla Naiya of WBJDF.Senior resident doctor Snighdha Hazra, who had also participated in a hunger strike, criticised the CBI investigation. “We are still hoping for a supplementary charge sheet by CBI,” she said. Junior doctor Soumyadip Roy added: “The CBI investigation has failed to bring forth the motive behind the crime. How can we consider that justice has been delivered?”Physician Biplab Chandra raised concerns about the pace and thoroughness of the investigation. “Seeing the pace of the CBI investigation, everyone feared that the real culprits might not be caught, and only Roy would be found guilty. This fear was not unfounded,” he said.Back at RG Kar Medical College, doctors kept a close watch on the court proceedings while continuing their duties. Although the protest site was empty as doctors focused on their work, they ensured fresh garlands were placed on the bust of the victim and the “Cry of the Hour” sculpture, symbolising the tragic crime.","Former colleagues of a 31-year-old resident doctor, raped and murdered at RG Kar Medical College on Aug 9 last year, expressed deep disappointment with the verdict delivered by the Sealdah trial court Saturday.

Top trust gave lion's share to BJP

Prudent's corporate donors surged to 83 in 2023-24 from 22 in previous financial year

NEW DELHI: Prudent Electoral Trust , the leading contributor to political parties through the ‘electoral trust’ route, was flooded with corporate donations following the scrapping of the electoral bonds scheme by the Supreme Court on Feb 15, 2024: three-fourths of its Rs 1075.7 crore donations in 2023-24 came between Feb 16 and March 31, 2024.According to Prudent’s contribution report for the last fiscal, now uploaded on the Election Commission website, donations received by it for distribution to political parties nearly tripled to Rs 1075.7 crore from Rs 363 crore in 2022-23. While it is not unusual for political donations to rise ahead of general elections, what is interesting is that while contributions of Rs 278.6 crore came in between April 1, 2023 and Feb 15, 2024, the period between Feb 16, 2024 and March 31, 2024, saw these surge to Rs 797.1 crore.This, in all probability, points to a diversion of corporate donations to the electoral trusts route from the bonds route, closed after Supreme Court clampdown.The number of Prudent’s corporate donors too surged to 83 in 2023-24 from around 22 in the previous financial year. Among the key corporates which contributed to Prudent in 2023-24 were Arcelor group and DLF Ltd (Rs 100 crore each); Maatha Projects LLP (Rs 75 crore); Maruti Suzuki and CESC Ltd (Rs 60 crore each); Hetero Group (Rs 55 crore); TVS Group and Apollo Tyres (Rs 50 crore each); Cipla (Rs 35.2 crore); and GMR group (Rs 26 crore). Megha Engineering and Infrastructure, the second biggest bond buyer, also contributed Rs 25 crore to Prudent, though this was well before the bonds were scrapped.Unlike the anonymity offered by poll bonds, electoral trusts are required to declare each individual contribution received along with the name of the donor. Also, it must declare each contribution disbursed to the political parties while also naming the party.

IMD Transponders: PM Modi’s speech puts focus on transponders on marine fishing boats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-speech-puts-focus-on-imd-gadget-on-boats/articleshow/117363174.cms,"PM Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent reference to timely warnings from the IMD easing worries for families of lakhs of sea-bound fishermen brought into focus a unique system of sharing weather alerts through use of indigenously developed transponders on marine fishing vessels.Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Diu, Goa, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have already installed transponders on over 4,000 vessels under the Centre’s plan to install one lakh such devices in 13 coastal states/UTs by Dec.The ones used in Odisha saved the lives of many fishermen who were out in the high seas during Cyclone Dana in October last year. Besides saving the lives of fishermen by timely sharing of weather alerts, the transponders —wireless tracking devices that use radio frequencies to operate — are also useful from a security point of view as they can be used for monitoring, control, and surveillance of marine fishing vessels.In case fishermen cross maritime boundaries, alerts will be issued to them to avoid unintentional transgression. It'll help Indian fishermen who unintentionally cross into the maritime boundaries of neighbouring countries - Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka - and get detained by security agencies. Such episodes invariably require significant diplomatic efforts to secure their release.There are 66,106 mechanized fishing boats and 1,35,763 motorised fishing boats currently operating throughout the coastal States/UTs. All the mechanised fishing vessels and a part of motorised fishing vessels will be covered by installing transponders under the present phase by December. ""Remaining ones and the new vessels, if any, will be covered in the next phase,"" said an official.The transponder is a two-way communication system enabling the fishermen to send short messages using their Android mobile phone while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast during any emergency to seek rescue operations. Information related to the Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) will also be made available to the fishermen on their mobile with the VCSS.""The system, designed to provide access to all features in the regional languages, also has efficient harbour management tools like token system for entry and exit of fishing vessels, and details of fishing crew on board establishing traceability of fish catch for compliance to international guidelines,"" said the official.The VCSS will help fishermen through Isro’s navigation satellite system, called NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), which can provide accurate real-time positioning information, helping fishermen stay informed about their location relative to national boundaries.""Fishermen will be notified if they approach or cross the national boundaries. If they accidentally cross the boundary, they can report their position and intention. Such reporting will help in negotiating their safe return,"" said the official.Currently, European Union (EU) nations, such as the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Chile, are using transponders on fishing vessels to enhance safety, improve monitoring, and combat illegal fishing.","Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Diu, Goa, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have already installed transponders on over 4,000 vessels.

'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: "" Sab sawaal ahamiyat rakhte hai, jawaab toh banta hai; aadatan kalam band jawaab dete rahe, aaj rubaroo toh banta hain.Kya pata kal ho ya na hon, aaj jawab banta hai ( All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Taylor Swift Surprises Brittany and Patrick Mahomes with a Unique Gift for Their Newborn Daughter, Reports Say



Taylor Swift’s bond with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes continues to deepen, showcasing her genuine warmth and thoughtfulness. Following the arrival of their baby girl, Golden Raye, on Sunday, Swift sent the couple a heartfelt, handmade gift, highlighting her personal touch. Patrick and Brittany, both 29, have built a loving family since their 2022 wedding. They are now proud parents to three children: Sterling Skye, born in 2021; Patrick ""Bronze"" Lavon III, born in 2023; and their newest addition, Golden Raye.It’s been an unforgettable week for Patrick Mahomes, both on and off the field. While the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback gears up for the Divisional Round of the NFL Playoffs against the Houston Texans, he and his wife Brittany celebrated the arrival of their third child. Born on January 12, their second daughter, Golden Raye Mahomes , was met with immense fanfare across social media, as congratulations poured in for one of the most beloved couples in sports.Among the flood of well-wishers was Taylor Swift, who has grown closer to Brittany Mahomes since her relationship with Chiefs star Travis Kelce began in 2023. Swift’s response to the announcement post on Instagram was a simple “like,” but her real gesture went far beyond the digital realm.According to Page Six, Swift took her signature thoughtfulness to a heartfelt level by gifting Golden Raye a handmade baby blanket crafted by her aunt. This sentimental gift carried a deeper significance for Swift, as it echoed a similar gesture she had cherished in her own childhood—a handmade baby blanket from her aunt. A source revealed, “It’s something Taylor loves doing for her close friends, a tradition that can’t be bought and truly comes from the heart.”This isn’t Swift’s first display of generosity toward the Chiefs’ family.

This tradition highlights Swift’s ability to make her gestures personal and meaningful, reinforcing her bond with those around her.For Patrick and Brittany Mahomes, the gesture was a reflection of Swift’s growing involvement with the Chiefs’ circle, despite her relatively new friendship with the Mahomes family.

Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers are two of the NFL's most celebrated quarterbacks, known for their exceptional skills, leadership, and game-winning performances. Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs ’ star, and Rodgers, now with the New York Jets, have both built impressive legacies. This comparison explores their net worth, contracts, career stats, and achievements to uncover how these NFL icons stack up against each other.Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers are not just NFL legends on the field—they’re also powerhouses when it comes to building wealth. As of 2024, Patrick Mahomes’s net worth is estimated at $90 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. This fortune stems from his groundbreaking 10-year, $477 million contract, one of the largest in sports history along with $26 million in bonuses and lucrative endorsement deals.Meanwhile, Aaron Rodgers takes it to another level with a staggering net worth of $200 million, more than double Mahomes’s fortune. Thanks to his high-paying contracts and sharp investment strategies, Rodgers has earned over $300 million from NFL salaries alone. In 2022, he signed a three-year, $150.8 million deal with the Green Bay Packers, including $101.5 million guaranteed.In 2023, his move to the New York Jets brought another impressive contract: $112.5 million over three years, with $75 million guaranteed. On top of that, endorsements with major brands like State Farm, Adidas, and TaylorMade Golf contribute an additional $9-11 million annually, further solidifying Rodgers’s financial legacy.Patrick Mahomes has cemented his legacy as one of the NFL’s elite quarterbacks, leading the Kansas City Chiefs to three Super Bowl victories and four appearances since taking the reins in 2018. With an impressive 15-3 playoff record, Mahomes boasts an 83.3% winning rate, highlighting his dominance in high-pressure games.Not only has Mahomes played in four Super Bowls placing him among just eight quarterbacks in NFL history to achieve this feat but he’s also guided the Chiefs to six consecutive AFC Championship Games, further solidifying his postseason credentials.In contrast, Aaron Rodgers, with just one Super Bowl win to his name, faces a different trajectory. While Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP, his playoff record doesn’t quite measure up to Mahomes’.Despite battling an Achilles injury in his debut season with the Jets, Rodgers is determined to lead New York in 2024. As a four-time NFL MVP, his wealth of experience and leadership are poised to elevate the Jets as they aim for a successful campaign.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes shares glimpse of gorgeous customized nursery for baby Golden Raye Patrick Mahomes has racked up 29,083 passing yards and 224 touchdowns over his career.

Meghan Markle Leadership Style: 'Couldn’t live with myself anymore': Meghan Markle’s leadership style led to staff needing therapy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/couldnt-live-with-myself-anymore-meghan-markles-leadership-style-led-to-staff-needing-therapy/articleshow/117347715.cms,"File photo: Meghan Markle (Picture credit: AP)

Shocking Change In Trump's Inauguration Plans; Americans 'Upset' After Unexpected Shift | Watch

Meghan Markle’s leadership style led some staff members to require therapy or take extended leave after working with her on professional projects, according to reports by Vanity Fair.In a recent profile marking five years since the Sussexes stepped back from royal duties, multiple individuals described their experiences working with the Duchess as emotionally taxing.Staff involved in Meghan’s projects, such as her Archetypes podcast for Spotify, reportedly found the work environment so challenging that they sought extended breaks or long-term counselling.One source likened the experience to being in a high-stress teenage drama, claiming, “It’s talking behind your back. It’s gnawing at your sense of self. Really, like, Mean Girls-teenager.”A former colleague recounted their initial excitement about joining Meghan’s team, only to later feel disillusioned, realising the negative atmosphere was not uncommon.Another said the tension stemmed from undermining behaviours, adding, “You can be yelled at even if somebody doesn’t raise their voice. It’s funny that people don’t differentiate between the energy of being yelled at and literally somebody screaming at you.”The Vanity Fair report alleges that several staff members either left their jobs or required professional help after enduring the demanding environment. One individual who worked on the podcast reportedly took a leave of absence after just three episodes, with others describing the need for extended breaks to escape scrutiny.One source claimed that working under Meghan led them to reevaluate their own principles: “I left because I couldn’t live with myself anymore.”These new claims echo earlier allegations from 2018, when Meghan faced a formal bullying complaint during her time as a working royal. That complaint alleged she had driven two personal assistants out of the household. While Buckingham Palace conducted an internal investigation, the findings were never publicly released.Meghan has consistently denied all bullying allegations.Sources quoted by Vanity Fair also suggested Meghan’s leadership approach involves harsh scrutiny of team members. One insider remarked: “She’s constantly playing checkers, not chess, but she’s very aware of where everybody is on her board. And when you are not in, you are to be thrown to the wolves at any given moment.”Another observer said the Duchess’s approach has damaged perceptions of her: “I think if Meghan acknowledged her own shortcomings or personal contributions to situations rather than staying trapped in a victim narrative, her perception might be better.”While Meghan’s media projects, including her podcast and Netflix collaborations, have drawn significant public interest, insiders suggest the couple has faced challenges navigating the entertainment industry.","Staff involved in Meghan's projects reportedly found the work environment so challenging that they sought extended breaks or long-term counselling.

It is doing so through a generous and non-reciprocal approach, funding and supporting energy, rail and road connectivity. Expanding trade and investment and intensifying exchanges and contacts. In times of crisis, India has served as an insurance for its smaller neighbours. Sri Lanka discovered that in 2023 when India put together a package of more than $4 billion... Political developments may throw up complex situations as we are currently witnessing in Bangladesh... It is the mutuality of interest that should be counted upon to prevail,"" Jaishankar said.""Pakistan remains the exception in our neighbourhood in view of its support for cross-border terrorism. And that cancer is now consuming its own body politic. The entire subcontinent has a shared interest in Pakistan abjuring that approach,"" he added.Speaking about India-China ties, Jaishankar noted that efforts are ongoing to resolve complications stemming from the 2020 border situation, and affirmed the need for strategic long-term planning.""Right now, the relationship (with China) is trying to entangle itself from the complications arising from the post-2020 border situation... More thought needs to be given to the long-term evolution of our ties. India has to prepare for expressions of China's growing capabilities, particularly those that impinge directly on our interests... A more rapid development of India's comprehensive national power is necessary... This is not just about correcting the earlier neglect of the border infrastructure and the oceanic periphery, but also mitigating dependence on sensitive domains... India's approach can be summed up in three mutuals; mutual respect, mutual sensitivity, and mutual interest,"" EAM said.""The emergence of a multipolar Asia is an essential prerequisite for a multipolar world. Changes in the stance of the United States and China are among the key factors contributing to the emergence of the Indo-Pacific as a theatre. For India, this engagement is a logical extrapolation of its active policy that focused on the ASEAN,"" he added.On Indo-Russia relations , the minister noted Russia's significant role in India's national security considerations and highlighted the stabilising effect of their economic cooperation on the global economy.""Russia has long held importance for India's foreign policy. Despite all the ups and downs that the world has seen since 1945, this is one relationship that has largely held steady. For decades, Russia has had a salience in India's national security calculus. As Russia is redirecting its attention towards Asia, there is a further logic that is emerging. Deeper economic cooperation between India and Russia has a stabilising consequence for the global economy,"" Jaishankar said.""The connectivity potential of the collaboration also holds great promise. India's expanding footprint will inevitably meet Russia's influence in many regions. Like the rest of the world, India is not impervious to the implications of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. It has been a persistent advocate of dialogue and diplomacy and is convinced that a solution cannot emerge from the battlefield,"" he added."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar took a jibe at Pakistan.

Roger Goodell highlights challenges of international NFL teams and focuses on global expansion strategies

Roger Goodell has proposed expanding the NFL to 18 regular-season games, cutting preseason to two, increasing international games, and possibly hosting the Super Bowl outside the U.S. to boost the league's global reach.Goodell has put forward a bold proposal to reshape the league. Key points of the plan include expanding the regular season to 18 games while cutting the preseason down to two games. Additionally, Goodell is pushing for more international games, potentially expanding from eight to 16 games per season, with new venues in cities like London, Madrid, and Abu Dhabi. The league has also discussed the possibility of hosting the Super Bowl outside the United States in the future.Talks about prolonging the regular season have been happening for a while speaking to Bloomberg, Goodell highlighted the potential for this expansion, stating,""If we continue to focus on the safety, I think 18 is a potential.” He added that this modification would entail lowering the preseason games to keep the current 20-game setup.""We actually started at 14 games and six preseason,"" Goodell explained. ""We went to 16 and four, and now 17 and three from 2021. So 18 and two is a logical step. But we would only do that with the players in agreement.”Goodell also spoke about the NFL's initiatives to extend its global reach. The league aims to hold a record eight games abroad in the 2025 season, including locations like Madrid and London. Looking to the future, Goodell outlined an ambitious strategy for international growth.“Our hope would be at some stage to get to 16 overseas games in the next few years."" This aligns with the NFL's broader tactic for making American football accessible to a worldwide audience.When discussing the possibility of establishing an NFL team outside the United States, Roger Goodell recognized the challenges that would come with such an expansion. He pointed out that while there is potential for growth beyond the existing 32 teams, creating new divisions in international markets might be a more feasible approach than launching individual overseas teams.This would allow the league to maintain competitive balance while tapping into global markets, without the logistical difficulties of managing teams in different countries.""You have a lot of issues with a team that's in - say Europe - and having to travel over playing - games and teams going back over to Europe to play,"" he noted. ""I think the competitive issues still need to be worked out.""Also Read: The Titans have hired the former Chiefs assistant general manager Mike Borgonzi as their 15th general manager These actions reflect the NFL's strategy to grow its audience and boost income by entering international markets. Still, such modifications must be approved by the NFL Players Association and take player safety into account. Negotiations are ongoing, with the league aiming to roll out these changes in the near future.","Roger Goodell has proposed expanding the NFL to 18 regular-season games, cutting preseason to two, and increasing international games.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
