Beirut airport cancels flights amid fears of Israeli attack; airlines cite 'insurance risks'

Several flights at Beirut airport were disrupted due to rising tensions between Israel and Hezbollah after a rocket strike in Golan Heights killed 12 children. Middle East Airlines cited insurance risks for the disruptions. Airlines including Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, and Ethiopian Air cancelled their flights. Lebanons Beirut-Rafic Hariri Airport has faced similar disruptions in past conflicts.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo and SpiceJet cancelled four flights to Leh Tuesday, as India’s highest airfield witnessed cancellations for the fourth day in a row due to an unprecedented heat wave. The airlines cited “anticipated bad weather” as the reason for the cancellations to AAI, which runs Leh’s Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport.Since July 27, as many as 16 flights have been cancelled due to high temperature in Ladakh.Leh airport sees cancellations when the mercury climbs beyond 32°C. “This is perhaps the first time that an extreme weather event (heat in high altitude) is causing flight cancellations at Leh airport.

NEW DELHI: There is conspiracy to break this society into compartments behind asking questions about how many SC/ST or OBC officials are part of the halwa ceremony and the making of the Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in Lok Sabha on Tuesday during her reply on the 2024 Budget.Sitharaman was reacting to comments made by the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha on Monday.As Rahul cited Mahabharata's 'chakravyuha' (trap) to attack the Modi government 3.0, he pulled out a photo of 'halwa ceremony' which was held at the ministry of finance before the presentation of Union budget as per tradition.""This photo shows budget ka halwa being distributed in this photo.

This seclusion is intended to maintain confidentiality and prevent any leaks or premature disclosures of budgetary proposals, she added.The preparation and sharing of sweets like halwa hold cultural significance in many Indian ceremonies and festivals.

vie for credit for Adani-linked project

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday took a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his ""Double A and A1,A2"" jibes at the BJP-led NDA government as she reminded the Congress leader about the recent milestone reached at Vizhinjam International Seaport in Kerala which welcomed its first mothership, 'San Fernando'.Rahul, who has often attacked the Narendra Modi government for favouring businessmen Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, had referred to the two as ""Double A"" and ""A1"" and ""A2"" during his recent speeches in Lok Sabha after Speaker Om Birla objected to naming individuals in Parliament who are not members of the House.Sitharaman today took digs at Rahul over his remarks and said: ""India's first trans-shipment port, all of us happily celebrated when a very big vessel reached Vizhinjam port. Kerala government, Congress government gave it, and nobody, who were speaking about double As and A1 and A2, questioned the Kerala government when Vizhinjam port was given on invitation to one of these investors.""It was the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) government of Oommen Chandy that had in 2015 inked a deal with Adani Ports and SEZ Private Limited for the mega project.The project was allotted to APSEZ on December 5, 2015, after the Government of Kerala and Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Ltd. (AVPPL) agreed to a concession agreement on August 17, 2015.The state government of Kerala has contributed about Rs 5,595 crore while the central government contributed Rs 818 crore for the port. Built on the public-private partnership, Vizhinjam International Port's construction started in 2016.After the arrival of first mother ship earlier this month, Kerala Congress president K Sudhakaran claimed credit on behalf of grand old party and said the port became reality only because of the “willpower” of Oommen Chandy who died in July 2023. “Vijayan should apologise to the people of Kerala. CPM tried to kill the project. It is ludicrous to see that he is trying to take credit for the port. There is a bid to cover up the role of Chandy in making the port a reality,” Sudhakaran said.The ruling CPM in Kerala, which was then in the opposition, had kept away from the inauguration of the port’s construction alleging that the port project was a “dubious deal”. In the run-up to the 2016 assembly elections, the CPM dubbed the Vizhinjam project “looting of the sea by the Adani group”.Nine years down the line, Vijayan, now the Kerala chief minister, took a U-turn and said “We have to realise that Kerala opens a new chapter in its history of development. It is a moment of pride for Kerala.Vijayan even appreciated Adani Group and said, ""Adani Group, the builders and operators of the port, deserve appreciation for their efforts in ensuring the completion of this project. Vizhinjam Port exemplifies a successful public-private partnership, highlighting the potential of collaborative development. Join us in celebrating this historic achievement that marks a new era of progress and prosperity for Kerala.""Clearly, Sitharaman was targeting this contradiction of stand within the opposition camp, especially vis-à-vis Rahul Gandhi who misses no opportunity to target the government for favouring the two businessmen, even as his party engages with them at the state level.","Nirmala Sitharaman took a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his ""Double A and A1,A2"" jibes at the NDA government.

Quad Meeting in Tokyo: Quad Condemns China's South China Sea Tactics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-raps-china-for-scs-manoeuvres-backs-philippines/articleshow/112117977.cms,"China expectedly loomed over the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo Monday as India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s “dangerous manoeuvres” in the South China Sea ( SCS ) and called for an Indo-Pacific in which no country dominates and no country is dominated.In a first, India also joined others in upholding in a joint statement the 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing’s expansive claims over SCS waters in its maritime dispute with the Philippines as the basis for peacefully resolving such disputes.Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his US, Australia and Japan counterparts - Antony Blinken, Penny Wong and Yoko Kamikawa respectively - called the award a significant milestone and.India had for the first time last year, in a joint statement with the Philippines, unambiguously asked China to adhere to the legally binding tribunal award Beijing has always called null and void. Before that India had restricted itself to only calling for respecting the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal was instituted.As they reassembled in Tokyo after the recent China-Philippines tensions, the ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and for this purpose, to enhance collaboration with regional partners. They also announced initiatives to enhance regional maritime domain awareness in the Pacific through satellite data, training and capacity building. “In line with such efforts, we intend to geographically expand the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) to the Indian Ocean region,” said the joint statement.The ministers also committed to soon having the 2024 Quad summit which PM Narendra Modi is now looking to host on the margins of the UNGA in New York in September, pending the availability of Japanese PM Fumio Kishida. Japan is yet to confirm because the date for ruling LDP election might clash with the General Assembly session, making it difficult for him to travel abroad.In his opening remarks, while talking about the need for Quad to uphold a rules-based order, Jaishankar said it’s only Quad collaboration that can ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains free, remains open, stable, secure and prosperous.“It is therefore essential that our political understanding strengthens, our economic partnerships grow, our technology collaborations expand and our people-to-people comfort intensifies. Our meeting should send a clear message, that the Quad is here to stay, here to do and here to go,” he addedIn their pushback against China, the Quad ministers backed sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also expressing commitment to address debt crises through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. They expressed serious concern about the situation in the East and South China Seas, reiterating their strong opposition to any unilateral action to change the status quo by force or coercion.“We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating manoeuvres in the South China Sea. We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous manoeuvres, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities,” said the joint statement.According to the ministers, Quad is also looking to contribute to the region through capacity building cooperation for enhancing maritime security. “We intend to launch a Quad Maritime Legal Dialogue under the Quad Maritime Security Working Group to focus our expertise on international law of the sea issues in support of our efforts to uphold the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific,” said the statement.","India, US, Australia and Japan expressed serious concern over Beijing’s ‘dangerous manoeuvres’ in the South China Sea ( SCS ) The ministers said they’re determined to contribute to maintaining and developing the free and open maritime order consistent with UNCLOS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112117994,imgsize-1556167,width-400,resizemode-4/112117994.jpg"

What was behind the Wayanad landslide?

Recurring disasters in Kerala

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The devastating landslides that struck the hilly regions near Meppadi in Kerala 's Wayanad district have claimed over 100 lives, while leaving over 128 others injured. The rescue efforts are ongoing, and the death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are recovered from the affected areas.According to official sources, 3,069 people have been relocated to 45 relief camps in Wayanad alone.Five ministers have been assigned to coordinate the relief and rescue operations , ensuring that the affected individuals receive the necessary support and assistance during this challenging time.In response to the incident, the Kerala government has declared a two-day state mourning. An official notification, issued by chief secretary V Venu, has announced the observance of official mourning on July 30 and 31. As a mark of respect, the National Flag will be flown at half-mast, and all public functions and celebrations will be cancelled during this period.Over 250 people have been moved to a safer location, and 300 personnel have been deployed for rescue operations in the wake of a tragic landslide in the Wayanad district of Kerala.While addressing the Rajya Sabha, Nityanand Rai, the minister of home affairs, said, ""Today morning, the Wayanad district of Kerala witnessed a tragic incident of a landslide... two people have been rescued from the debries and around 250 people have been evacuted to safer locations.""The rescue efforts involve two teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), two columns of the Indian Army, and two Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters, with a total of 300 personnel working together.Kerala chief minister assured that the state government has made arrangements for the best possible treatment for those who were injured in the incident. However, many people remain trapped under the debris while the rescue operations are ongoing.Providing details about the relief operations, CM added, ""321 members of the Fire Force have been deployed in Wayanad. The services of the Army have also been made available. An NDRF team of 60 members has reached Wayanad, and an 89-member team from Bengaluru is on the way"".The Wayanad landslide was triggered by extremely heavy rainfall caused by the warming of the Arabian Sea, according to climate experts.S Abhilash, the director of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), explained that the active monsoon offshore trough has been affecting the entire Konkan region for the last two weeks, leading to saturated soil in Kasargod, Kannur, Wayanad, Calicut, and Malappuram districts.On Monday, a deep mesoscale cloud system formed off the coast in the Arabian Sea, resulting in extremely heavy rain in Wayanad, Calicut, Malappuram, and Kannur. ""The clouds were very deep, similar to those seen during the 2019 Kerala floods,"" Abhilash said.Scientists have observed a trend of very deep cloud systems developing over the southeast Arabian Sea, which sometimes intrude into the land, as seen in 2019.The southeast Arabian Sea is becoming warmer, causing atmospheric instability above this region, including Kerala. With climate change , the rain-bearing belt with deep clouds is extending southward, which is the main reason behind such extremely heavy rainfall.In August 2018, Kerala experienced a devastating flood that claimed the lives of 483 people and was considered the state's worst flood in a century. The catastrophe not only resulted in the loss of lives but also caused extensive damage to property and livelihoods, prompting the central government to declare it a ""calamity of severe nature"".As Kerala was recovering from the 2018 floods, another tragedy struck in 2019 when a landslide in Puthumala, Wayanad, approximately 10 km from the currently affected areas, claimed 17 lives. In October 2021, heavy rainfall triggered landslides in Idukki and Kottayam districts, resulting in the death of 35 people. According to data provided by the IMD, heavy rainfall and flood-related incidents in 2021 led to the loss of 53 lives in Kerala.Exactly a year later, in August 2022, landslides and flash floods caused by heavy rains claimed 18 lives, damaged hundreds of properties, and forced thousands of people to seek shelter in relief camps, as reported by the state government.During the 2022 rain-related incidents, over 5,000 individuals were evacuated from disaster-hit and disaster-prone regions of the state and accommodated in 178 relief camps.The ministry of earth sciences has reported that Kerala has experienced the highest number of landslides in the country, with 2,239 out of 3,782 landslides occurring in the state between 2015 and 2022.","Death toll expected to rise as more bodies are recovered from the affected areas. 3,069 people have been relocated to 45 relief camps in Wayanad alone. Kerala government has declared a two-day state mourning. The landslide was triggered by extremely heavy rainfall caused by the warming of the Arabian Sea.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112144791,imgsize-1834772,width-400,resizemode-4/112144791.jpg"

This is why Western Ghats need to be tagged eco-sensitive area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/this-is-why-western-ghats-need-to-be-tagged-eco-sensitive-area/articleshow/112149055.cms,"NEW DELHI: Landslides that hit the ecologically fragile region of Wayanad in Kerala on Tuesday is a stark reminder of the failure of successive govts in notifying the Western Ghats as an eco-sensitive area ( ESA ) - a prerequisite to preserving the terrain by banning environmentally hazardous human activities.Despite five draft notifications by the Union environment ministry since March 2014, the states - initially Kerala but later mainly Karnataka - are still not on board for final notification leaving ecologically sensitive areas unprotected.It is learnt that one more draft notification, the sixth one, is expected to be issued in a day or two as the validity of the fifth notification expired a month ago. The draft will give yet another chance to work towards building consensus that has eluded the region for the last 10 years.The entire Western Ghats, spread over six states including Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, is the second most landslide-prone region of the country after Himalayas. Though Maharashtra and Goa sought a reduction in the extent of ESA within the respective states for allowing development works, the then govt in Karnataka urged the Centre in 2022 to withdraw the draft arguing that it would adversely affect the livelihood of the people in the state.Absence of ESA cover to Western Ghats, meanwhile, resulted in continuation of several environmentally-hazardous human activities, including massive deforestation for mining and construction over the years, leading to loosening of soil and affecting hillside stability -- the main reason of landslides during extremely heavy rainfall like the ones that struck Kerala.IMD data shows that the state received 537% more than normal daily (24 hours) rainfall on July 30. “The landslide was caused by very heavy rainfall over the region during the last two days. Soil conditions were conducive with previous episodes of rains,” Madhavan Rajeevan, former secretary of ministry of earth sciences (MoES), told TOI.He said though the heavy precipitation was predicted by MoES based on scientific models, the question remained how the prior information could translate into landslide warning. “We need a multi-institutional framework for developing robust landslide prediction systems. We know the science of landslides well. We need to convert it into good services,” said Rajeevan, vice-chancellor of Atria University, Bengaluru.Experts also believe that controlled deforestation and adoption of sustainable development models could have prevented such disasters in the region impacted by climate change.“The devastating landslides in Wayanad, fueled by excessive monsoon rains, underscore the urgent need to address the impacts of climate change. Kerala has increasingly suffered from such events, which are closely tied to global warming and climate change, driving irregular and heavy rainfall patterns,” said Anjal Prakash, climate change expert and research director, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business (ISB).Prakash, clinical associate professor at ISB, too believed that implementing robust early warning systems with enhanced weather forecasting technologies can provide timely alerts about heavy rainfall and potential landslides, enabling residents to evacuate and prepare.“Additionally, promoting sustainable land management through reforestation, controlled deforestation, and sustainable agriculture is crucial for maintaining hillside stability and reducing soil erosion, thus lessening the effects of heavy rains,” he said","Landslides that hit the ecologically fragile region of Wayanad in Kerala on Tuesday is a stark reminder of the failure of successive govts in notifying the Western Ghats as an eco-sensitive area.

The safety reviews are complemented with periodic inspections and observation by the resident site observer team. “Board assured itself of the systematic regulatory oversight by the AERB, took cognisance of the detailed submissions presented, safety review outcomes tabled and also visited the plant. Based on the above, the said permission was granted,” he said.“This permission marks a significant step towards operationalisation of PFBR. The 500MWe sodium cooled PFBR being commissioned by BHAVINI at Kalpakkam is a significant milestone in the country's nuclear power programme.In line with the govt’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign, PFBR has been fully designed and constructed indigenously by Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Ltd (BHAVINI)— which was created in 2003 to construct and operate India’s most advanced nuclear reactor-PFBR — with significant contributions from Indian industries.Earlier this year, the core loading activity of PFBR was initiated in a phased manner beginning with insertion of control sub-assemblies followed by blanket sub-assemblies with necessary permissions from AERB.In the final stage of core loading, fuel sub-assemblies would be loaded in the core of the reactor following which the nuclear fission process would commence. On attainment of sustained nuclear fission chain reaction, a phenomenon known as criticality of the reactor, various low power physics experiments would be conducted.","The 500 MWe sodium-cooled prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) located at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu has finally got approval from atomic regulator Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.

Another significant change is that any case pertaining to illegal conversion will have to be heard by a sessions court or higher.The Bill, tabled by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna on behalf of CM Yogi Adityanath, includes two sub-clauses. The first introduces a fine of Rs 10 lakh and imprisonment of up to 14 years if the convict is found associated with ""foreign"" or ""illegal"" agencies. Under the second clause, the convict would be liable for a jail term ranging from 20 years to life if found guilty of unlawful religious conversion ""by luring/provoking a person, essentially a minor girl or women from the SC/ST community"".The convict could also be ordered to pay compensation to the victim to cover livelihood and medication expenses. Khanna said there was ""nothing controversial"" about an amendment to a Bill aiming to ""bring justice to victims subjected to unlawful religious conversions"".The bid to curb forced religious conversion started with an ordinance brought by the Yogi government in Nov 2020. A Bill was passed later by both Houses of the UP legislature. The new law took effect in 2021.Opposition wants the amendment Bill to be referred to a select committee with a mandate to submit its report within a month. LoP Mata Prasad Pandey said since the law could lead to false cases being lodged, a clause such as a year's imprisonment for such a crime should be inserted into the amendment Bill.Khanna responded to opposition's doubts by saying that the amended law safeguards the interests and liberty of every individual.

They will soon receive substantial monthly remuneration from the Global Tiger Forum (GTF) for their enhanced responsibilities, transitioning from previous voluntary roles,” Singh said.The DFO said, “With the Prime Minister's endorsement, we expect the Bagh Mitra programme to be adopted across all tiger reserves in the country. This is crucial as India lost 1,062 tigers between 2012 and 2022, and many reserves face a shortage of field personnel.”Moreover, Singh announced the establishment of a master control room at PTR headquarters by Oct to receive and store conflict-related information for future planning.

In a significant shakeup, Bud Light is no longer the top-selling beer in the United States. This shift follows a turbulent year for the brand, which faced a backlash after collaborating with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney for a social media campaign. The partnership led to a boycott from conservative consumers, causing a significant drop in sales for Bud Light and other brands owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.The company's handling of the controversy also resulted in criticism from the LGBTQ+ community.Currently, Bud Light sales remain down by around 28%. The brand, once dominant, has been overtaken by Modelo Especial , which became the best-selling beer in the U.S. in May of last year and has maintained its lead.

The Mughals' ability to maintain composure despite donning bulky traditional attire and carrying out household chores is something that is rarely discussed, except from their breathtakingly beautiful palaces, graceful dance as depicted in movies, or heartfelt hymns chanted in Allah's honour. But how did the Mughals survive without air conditioning? How did they build cooling architecture? That is the question.In the 21st century.It's as if we continually shatter our own records of hottest days alive. July 22 was the hottest day with the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth. A deadly heat wave across the world and malfunctioning air conditioners claimed many people's lives for a while.Air conditioning in buildings indicates considerable energy use and utility expenditures. Today, while we are developing sustainable heating and cooling technologies to comply with the green construction movement, it is important to note that ecological heating and cooling techniques have been employed for as long as humans have been building homes. Mughal architecture in India provides unique active and passive air conditioning technologies that can be easily incorporated into contemporary buildings.The Mughals employed two elements to regulate the weather around the structure: flora and water. These waterways and fountains were frequently extended into the interiors of structures. The Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element. Large reflecting pools and water channels, referred to as ""rills,"" were frequently included into the architecture of structures and landscapes.Through evaporation, these water elements not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal but also helped to cool the air. The pools' reflecting surfaces also assisted in deflecting sunlight from the structures, which lessened their ability to absorb heat.One common element of Mughal design was jharokhas, or overhanging enclosed balconies. These buildings promoted natural ventilation in addition to their aesthetic appeal. Jharokhas were positioned strategically to allow air to move throughout the building, limiting direct sunlight and offering shade while also facilitating a steady supply of fresh air.Huge courtyards and verdant gardens were frequently incorporated into the architectural designs of Mughal structures. The environment was significantly cooled by these open areas. Cooler air might flow within the buildings and hot air could exit through the courtyards. Gardens, which frequently have pools and other water elements, produced a microclimate that considerably lowered the temperature.The Mughals also employed inventive cooling methods like terraces and roof gardens. By acting as insulation, these raised gardens assisted in lowering the amount of heat that the roofs absorbed. Through transpiration, the flora on the roof gardens had a cooling effect that improved the comfort of the interior spaces below.Buildings with thick walls and lofty ceilings were among the Mughals' most simple yet effective strategies. As insulators, the thick walls limited the amount of heat that could enter from the outside, keeping the interiors cold. The living areas below were significantly cooler due to the hot air rising to the high ceilings. This type of architecture was especially common in palaces and huge public structures.Large domes and chhatris, or elevated dome-shaped pavilions, were useful features in Mughal design in addition to being decorative. These buildings promoted air movement and offered shade. Because of their high ceilings, the domes assisted in keeping the lower rooms cooler by retaining hot air and letting it to leave through ventilation at the top.Mughal architecture was distinguished by its finely carved jaali screens. Similar to contemporary blinds, these perforated stone screens allowed air to travel through while obstructing direct sunlight, producing a cooling effect. The jaali screens made sure the interiors stayed pleasant even on the warmest days by dispersing sunlight and lowering heat buildup.Mughal buildings were orientated with great care to maximise shade and reduce heat gain. Structures were frequently orientated to benefit from the dominant winds, which improved natural ventilation. Living areas were kept cool and shaded by the use of covered pathways and verandas.","Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element. Large reflecting pools and water channels, referred to as ""rills,"" were frequently included into the architecture of structures and landscapes. Thick walls and lofty ceilings were among the Mughals' most simple yet effective strategies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112110831,imgsize-252716,width-400,resizemode-4/112110831.jpg"
"22,920 candidates score full marks across 45 subjects in CUET-UG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/22920-candidates-score-full-marks-across-45-subjects-in-cuet-ug/articleshow/112089968.cms,"Highest full-marks scorers in Business Studies, Political Science next

NEW DELHI: Registering a marginal increase in top scorers, 22,920 candidates scored full marks across 45 subjects in the Common University Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( CUET-UG 2024), the gateway to undergraduate courses across 283 universities in India.However, this year, as earlier announced by National Testing Agency, these top scorers scored perfect 200, while in 2022 and 2023 the agency accorded percentile scores as the papers were conducted in multiple sessions and normalisation method was employed.Bringing relief to lakhs of aspirants, NTA announced the results on Sunday evening. Of the 63 subjects, 200 is the maximum marks for 62 and the General Test paper is of 250 marks.The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520).In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200. Of the 8.2 lakh candidates who took the English test, 1,683 scored 200.Sanskrit and Punjabi were the other two languages where over 50 candidates had perfect scores. A total of 22,836 aspirants scored 100 percentile in 2023 and 21,159 scored 100 percentile in 2022.Though the number of perfect scorers increased marginally from the number of 100 percentile scorers in 2023, the competition for select programmes like commerce is set to get tougher in popular universities like Delhi University (DU). The number of aspirants scoring 100 percentile in Busi- ness Studies was 2,357 in 2023, which has increased to 8,024 this year. However, for sought after honour programmes like economics/business econom- ics, there is likely to be a de- crease in minimum eligible marks as the number of high scorers have come down by 454% from last year. Among the 8,000-plus perfect scorers in Business Studies is Khusali Nahataa from Delhi, who aspires for admission in Shri Ram College of Commerce or Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University.A student of Modern School, Barakhambha Road, she said, “I chose to study BS with a lot of mind maps and charts. I’m aiming for SRCC or LSR. I did not take any coaching and did 8-10 hours of self-study every day.” Anjali Jyoti, a student of DAV Noida, Sector 56, scored 200/200 in three (Geography, Political Science and Psychol- ogy) of the five subjects she appeared. she said, “I want to pursue BA (Political Science H) from one of the best colleg- es of DU. I relied entirely on self-study as maximum syl- labus was from Class 12 so there was no need for extra sources or coaching. Only the deleted portion needed to be covered separately.”On July 7, NTA had released provisional answer keys of CUET-UG 2024. A retest for over 1,000 candidates whose grievances were found genuine by the agency was conducted on July 19. The delay in CUET-UG results comes amid a row over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including in NEET-UG and UGC-NET.Originally, CUET results were scheduled to be released on June 30 but NTA delayed it, grappling with paper leak allegations involving NEETUG, UGC-NET and CSIRUGC-NET. CUET-UG, conducted in hybrid mode for the first time across the country, was cancelled in Delhi a night before the scheduled exam over “logistical reasons”. The exam was conducted in the national capital later.NTA had earlier an- nounced that the third edition of CUET-UG would be com- pleted in seven days and there would be no normalisation of scores as all exams would be conducted in a single shift.For 15 subjects, the tests were in pen-paper mode and for the other 48, the exam was held in CBT mode. Over 13.4 lakh candidates registered for the test for admission to undergraduate courses in 261 central, state, deemed and private universities this year.In the first edition of the exam in 2022, the test was plagued by technical glitches. Also, as a result of tests for a subject being conducted over multiple shifts, the scores had to be normalised during announcement of results.","The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520) In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200.

Natasa Stankovic Gets Trolled For Sharing Videos of Her Happy Moments with Son in Serbia

When you picture the world's richest people in the world, the names of Mukesh Ambani, Elon Musk, Jess Bezos, Bernard Arnault & family, and Mark Zuckerberg come to the mind. But long before, any of them existed a powerful Chinese Empress Wu Zetian of Tang dynasty , boasted of wealth of around 16 trillion USD , which could overshadow combined net worth of the wealthiest people across the globe.Emperess Wu Zetian was someone whose political prowess is comparable to notable women, like Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, and Catherine the Great. Popularly known as Empress Wu, the richest-ever female monarch accumulated the unfathomable fortune, with her astute vision, shrewd techniques, and brutal decisions, that also included killing of her own children, it is said. While she was hailed for some of her decisions like reducing the taxes on peasants that helps in increasing agricultural productivity and thus state revenue, she also took some controversial decisions. The controversy surrounding her life was definitely exaggerated by historians who were prejudiced towards woman with strong ambitions. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence of her cruelty towards the rich and affluent. She also was particularly ruthless towards her enemies real or imagined.As per one of the accounts, her power hunger and paranoia led her to kill one of her own children - her daughter - and depose her sons who were emperors before her. She, however, helped expand the Chinese empire significantly in the 15 years of her reign from 690 C.E. to 705 C.E.Wu Zetian was born in a wealthy family to a timber merchant in 624 AD in Shanxi province. Her father was close to Li Yuan, who eventually ascended to become Emperor Gaozong of Tang and this gave her an opportunity to forge close connections with the royal household.Empress Wu was deeply passionate about literature from a very early age and at the age of 14, she was appointed as a secretary in the Tang Palace, getting an opportunity to work under Emperor Taizong.Subsequently, the emperor's death led her to a Buddhist monastery which was a common practice for all the women associated with the emperor during that time. However her affair with Emperor Gaozong, the deceased emperor’s son and successor, once against brought an unexpected twist in her journey as she once again made her way back to the palace as a concubine.With her cunning ways, she soon ousted Empress Wang and ascended to the throne as an empress in the year 655. A major turning point for her was when Emperor Gaozong entrusted the empress with the governance of his empire after his health took a turn for the worse and he started having debilitating migraine-like headaches and vision loss.Thus, started a historic reign that made her the first and only woman to rule China. Well-educated, visionary, and an excellent public speaker, Empress Wu is credited with a number of welfare measures that also boosted trade like reducing taxation to re-opening of silk road to trade.Did you like this article?

MUMBAI: Sturdy old concrete steps that led the public to one of the two entrances of a Mhada recreation ground (RG) plot in Powai , Rambaug Lane , were suddenly and swiftly demolished in the past two days, much to the shock of local residents , some of whom have intimated the Mhada-Mumbai office.The residents fear that the vast extra space created by the destruction of the 30-year-old stairs can be further encroached by vested interests .Hence, they are demanding that the authorities rebuild the staircase, and also take action against whosoever is responsible for the destruction of public property .""Many locals noticed how these Mhada-built concrete steps, located next to building number 11 (shops) on one side, and boundary of building numbers 5 and 6 on the other, were being destroyed by a drilling machine on July 28 and 29. It is rather strange as to why anyone would have any problem with these steps. Many suspect encroachment of space to be the reason behind this,'' said a Powai resident.Another local of Rambaug Lane, Madhavi Desai, commented: ``Animal feeders used to often climb up these cemented steps in order to feed the dogs and cats since the animals would prefer to sit inside this Mhada ground which has a lot of greenery. However, now that these steps have been demolished, there is no possibility for the dogs to go to the Mhada RG plot. The other, second entrance to this ground has been kept locked by some private party.''Desai added that the Mhada officials must thoroughly investigate such an irregularity and also see how to rebuild this staircase again.The Mhada-Mumbai executive engineer (Kurla division) Rahul Vhatkar said that his staff will inquire into this issue by going to the site. Another official from the same department informed us that Mhada had not given any orders to demolish these steps; hence further inquiry is needed on this serious matter.In the last three to four years, a few more irregularities have come to light from Rambaug Lane. About eight months ago several housing societies had complained to Mhada about a permanent stage being constructed inside a second Mhada ground where children play cricket.In June-July 2021, there were multiple attempts to illegally cut down a tamarind tree inside the Mhada RG plot, in order to create more space. Nature lovers had complained to the BMC and Mhada, leading to the lodging of an FIR against unknown persons then.""It is quite suspicious the way these stairs were broken and removed. The local politicians also encourage such irregularities. The civic authorities should instead provide street lights at Rambaug Lane, which have been defunct ever since the road concretization work had taken place earlier this year,'' said a disturbed resident.",Sturdy old concrete steps that led the public to one of the two entrances of a Mhada recreation ground (RG) plot in Powai were suddenly and swiftly demolished in the past two days.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Hundreds of China merchants join protest against Temu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/hundreds-of-china-merchants-join-protest-against-temu/articleshow/112152420.cms,"What Bloomberg intelligence says

Lingering tensions between PDD’s Temu and merchants using the platform — which have prompted protests in China, according to media reports — may force Temu to offer sellers subsidies to avoid defections to other overseas platforms such as Amazon.com, Alibaba’s AliExpress, Shein and TikTok Shop, where our checks show more flexible business practices. Appeasing merchants would drive up costs and spur steeper-than-expected margin declines for PDD into 2025.

- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts

Hundreds of merchants staged a rally at PDD Holdings Inc ’s offices in southern China this week, protesting what they called unfair penalties that Temu ’s owner is increasingly levying.The suppliers, mainly smaller outfits that sell Chinese goods to Western shoppers via the fast-growing Temu platform, brandished placards and yelled slogans outside a Guangzhou company outpost Monday, according to attendees and videos circulated on social media.Some managed to get into Temu offices though they eventually dispersed without meeting senior executives, according to several witnesses, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.The protest was the culmination of growing frustration among merchants and third-party sellers, who feel PDD is increasingly squeezing them for revenue as it embarks on a costly global expansion. Their complaints center on PDD’s practice of withholding payments to merchants who’re judged to have fallen short on customer expectations, the people said. That includes anything from missing delivery deadlines to mis-matched product listings.Those penalties or fines have risen sharply in recent months, often without clear explanation, they said. PDD or Temu typically either withhold payment for products already sold, or levy a fine of several times the retail prices, the people added. PDD’s shares slid 3.5% in New York, their biggest single-day fall since June.The dispute coincides with an aggressive expansion that’s taken the Temu brand around the world. PDD and its Temu platform exploded on the scene in 2023 with an expensive Super-Bowl ad. It’s since begun to challenge fellow Chinese online shopping giant Shein, and even Amazon .com Inc in certain segments. It launched in Thailand just this month.That breakneck global expansion at one point helped US-listed PDD — which stands for Pinduoduo — become China’s most valuablee-commerce company, outstripping longtime leaders Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc.This week’s protest cap at least two rallies since May, according to the people, some of which have been described by local media including Yicai. A Temu representative acknowledged that it’s locked in a dispute with roughly a dozen sellers about “after-sales issues” related to the quality and compliance of their products. The disagreement involved several million yuan, the representative said.The spokesperson said several of those merchants recently gathered outside the site of a Temu logistics affiliate, but did not provide further details on Monday’s action.“These merchants have declined to resolve the disputes through the normal arbitration and legal channels stated in the seller agreements,” the company said in a statement. “The situation is stable, and the company is actively working with the merchants to find a solution.”Temu is driving abroad in part because domestic Chinese consumption is flagging, struggling to recover from years of Covid-era malaise. But many others, including Shein, ByteDance Ltd’s TikTok Shop and Alibaba’s own AliExpress have the same idea. That’s threatening to squeeze margins and drive up costs.Beijing on various occasions has openly expressed support for what they call cross-border e-commerce, or the sale of Chinese goods abroad — the driving force behind Shein’s and Temu’s meteoric ascent in the US. But this year, reports began circulating about growing dissatisfaction among Temu’s merchants in China, who supply the bulk of the cheap, fast-moving goods that consumers abroad are hoovering up.Some analysts say loss-making Temu won’t be able to sustain its mix of low prices and quick delivery for long — the key is whether it can get shoppers to return. Others say the company could become a major global player in coming years.It’s unclear whether PDD is making moves to assuage merchants. For Temu, the danger is that suppliers and sellers may migrate to other platforms, disrupting the flow of goods vital for supporting the fledgling platform’s growth.PDD more than doubled revenue in the March quarter. It has expanded to more than 60 countries but that growing profile has raised the risk of regulatory scrutiny in key markets like the US, which barred ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok over data security concerns.European consumer groups filed a complaint this year with the European Commission that accused Temu of failing to protect consumers and employing manipulative practices.",PDD’s Temu and merchants using the platform may force Temu to offer sellers subsidies to avoid defections to other overseas platforms. Appeasing merchants would drive up costs and spur steeper-than-expected margin declines for PDD into 2025.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152480,imgsize-347158,width-400,resizemode-4/112152480.jpg"

This career shift brought her significant income and numerous gifts from her fans.Despite her family's concerns about the impact of her profession on her health, Pan continued to push herself to extreme limits. She rented a separate studio for her streaming sessions to ensure a more professional setup. However, her dedication came at a high cost. She often consumed up to 10 kg of food in a single session and spent up to 10 hours a day eating. These extreme eating habits led to multiple hospitalisations, including one due to gastric bleeding.At the time of her death, Pan weighed 300 kg. Although the official cause of death was not disclosed, reports indicate that her stomach was filled with undigested food, and the lower part was deformed. An autopsy confirmed the severe damage caused by her excessive eating.According to Creaders.net, her parents were concerned about her dangerous eating habits, urging her to stop.

The Olympic Games have stood for harmony, superiority, and the unwavering quest of greatness by the human spirit for a very long time. As the 2024 Summer Olympics get underway in Paris, the city of lights gets ready to host this historic event for the third time in its illustrious history. It looks as though the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris will be a wonderful festival of culture, athletics, and global friendship.Modern facilities and iconic sites will provide breathtaking settings for athletes from more than 200 countries to participate in a variety of sports, exhibiting their incredible talent, tenacity, and dedication.But, according to the reports, there have been some countries that have been exempted from the Olympics since the past due to its issues between the countries. Let’s have a look at the countries that have been banned from competing in the Olympics for a variety of reasons.Five nations were left out of the invitation list for the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium, following World War I: Austria, Hungary, Germany, Turkey, and Bulgaria. In the same way, the Axis nations of World War II—Japan and Germany—were not invited to the 1948 London Olympics.An Olympic rival first appeared in the 1960s. Indonesia organised the Games of the New Emerging Forces. Athletes who competed in those events were banned by the IOC.Due to the Apartheid system, South Africa was barred from competing in the Tokyo Games in 1964. Nearly 30 years passed during the ban.Rhodesia was prohibited from competing in the Olympics due to its formation as a government exclusively for White people. The IOC banned them from the Munich Games in 1972 as a result of their racist policies. Before they could compete once more, the nation was later abolished and recreated as Zimbabwe.Afghanistan was not allowed to participate in the Sydney Games in 2000 because of its Taliban-era discrimination against women and ban on all forms of sports.Because of government intervention, the Kuwaiti Olympic Committee has been suspended since October 2015. In 2010, they were also suspended; however, the suspension was revoked prior to the 2012 Olympic Games. Nine Kuwaiti athletes participated in the competition after that under the Olympic flag.Due to drug infractions, the IOC disqualified numerous Russian competitors from the 2016 Rio Olympics. This restriction was expanded to include the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where Russian competitors would have to compete flying the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) flag instead of the Russian flag.Due to their role in the conflict in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus are not allowed to compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Russia broke the Olympic Truce in 2022 when it invaded Ukraine, a UN-backed resolution meant to foster peace during the Olympics.","The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris will be a wonderful festival of culture, athletics, and global friendship.

Pakistan to launch new messaging app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-launch-new-messaging-app/articleshow/112152439.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has said it would “soon” launch a new messaging application , “Beep Pakistan”, which will initially be used for communication by govt employees and later made available to the general public.The announcement came as Pakistani users have been facing problems with WhatsApp , especially when sending and receiving media files. Digital rights advocates suspect that the country’s testing and deployment of an internet firewall , intended to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech, may be the cause of the disruption.“Beep Pakistan”, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication which says it will be launched “soon” among other government departments.“The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and telecommunication.When the plan was announced last year, the then IT minister, Syed Aminul Haque, described it as Pakistan’s alternative to WhatsApp.Now, govt is distancing itself from that comparison. “Any comparison to WhatsApp is misplaced as there is no intention to compete with any third-party platform,” Khwaja said, adding the purpose of this app is to protect privacy and data.Haque, who currently heads the National Assembly’s standing committee on IT, said govt plans to roll out the application to all its employees within the next 45 days. “Then we will see the situation and launch it for the public too,” he said. Unlike WhatsApp, the former IT minister said, “Beep’s data centre will be in Pakistan, ensuring 100% safety and security. Just as China has WeChat and America has WhatsApp, Pakistan now has its own app.”Pakistani authorities have long been concerned about WhatsApp’s security features, particularly after reports in Dec 2019 that at least two dozen senior officials were targeted by Pegasus, a spyware developed by an Israeli cybersecurity firm. At that time the Pakistan govt instructed all officials to avoid sharing sensitive and confidential documents over WhatsApp.When asked if WhatsApp would be banned in the country following Beep Pakistan’s public launch, Khwaja, the IT minister, denied any plans to block WhatsApp in the country. Haque said he was not in favour of a ban. “But since Beep Pakistan is safe and secure we wish it to be used in Pakistan and those who want to use WhatsApp can continue to use it,” he said.","“Beep Pakistan’, described as a local alternative to WhatsApp, has been currently undergoing trial runs within the ministry of information technology and telecommunication. “The design of the application is robust enough to offer it to the general citizens of Pakistan at later stages, if desired,” said Shaza Fatima Khwaja, state minister for IT and tele communication.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112152447,imgsize-401505,width-400,resizemode-4/112152447.jpg"
Pakistan seeks reprofiling of over $27 billion debt with friendly nations: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-seeks-reprofiling-of-over-27-billion-debt-with-friendly-nations-finance-minister/articleshow/112099105.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF, according to a media report on Monday. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund last month announced that it signed a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to provide a $7 billion loan which would be disbursed for 37 months.However, it attached stringent conditions with it, requiring Pakistan prior action before the fund's board accords final approval for the loan.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb after returning from Beijing told the media on Sunday that talks have been going on with China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a re-profiling of $27 billion.Aurangzeb said Pakistan had already asked the friendly bilateral trio of lenders to roll over its more than $12 billion annual debt portfolio by three to five years to secure the IMF board's approval, which is expected next month.This is on top of Islamabad's request to Beijing to convert imported coal-based projects to local coal and re-profile more than $15 billion in energy sector liabilities to create fiscal space amid difficulties in timely repayments.Pakistan has a peculiar financial arrangement with these three countries in the shape of commercial loans and SAFE deposits that are rolled over every year and form a major part of the IMF programme in terms of external financing needs.Pakistan has now requested the maturity period of these loans - $5 billion from China, $4 billion from Saudi Arabia, and $3 billion from the UAE - to be extended to at least three years, offering greater predictability under the IMF programme.Aurangzeb said the Chinese side acknowledged Pakistan's foreign exchange difficulties and wanted to help in new business ventures and the re-profiling of energy sector payments besides playing its role in supporting Pakistan's case at the IMF board as one of the major stakeholders.He said the process of debt and equity rescheduling had been started and would now go to the working groups with relevant financial institutions and sponsors of Chinese projects for which Pakistan hired local Chinese consultants.""Between now and the IMF board meeting (on the 37-month bailout package), we have to ensure confirmation of external financing"" from friendly bilateral partners, the minister said.However, he explained that the Chinese energy sector debt reprofiling had nothing to do with the IMF programme as other prior actions had been completed and structural benchmarks were under implementation.Aurangzeb said he was in contact with the Chinese, Saudi and UAE finance ministers for an extension in debt rollover for three years and they had assured their support that would place Pakistan in a very comfortable position in terms of external financing gap.""I can assure you we are at a very good place on external financing for the next three years, including year one, year two and year three,"" he said.He said the IMF had worked out a financing needs assessment for three years that also included its own $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. After rollovers from friendly countries, the remaining external financing gap would become very manageable, he said.Responding to a question, the minister said Pakistan was not seeking any incremental financing from friendly countries. ""The only incremental thing is an extension in the maturity period for three years instead of yearly rollovers,"" he said.Aurangzeb said that the issue of energy sector repayments was initially taken up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing and followed it up with formal letters to Prime Minister Li Keqiang.As part of the process, Aurangzeb, along with Power Minister Awais Leghari, held meetings with Chinese finance and energy ministers and the governor of the Chinese central bank to understand the context of Pakistan's ability to pay, economic stability and relief in energy tariffs.He said the two sides discussed conversions of Chinese power projects to local coal and how to take their technical, logistical and financial parameters forward.Secondly, financial re-profiling would also need to be discussed with banks and project sponsors one by one. ""They have recognised this and the process would now move forward on that basis,"" Aurangzeb said.He said the re-profiling of CPEC debt was also discussed with the governor of the Chinese central bank and ""we would need to go project by project given the CPEC structure"".""Very positive discussions have taken place from my perspective,"" he said, adding the debt of Chinese independent power producers (IPPs) was manageable as their legal payments were being made, but the issue pertained to return on equity to project sponsors mainly because of foreign exchange which required to be rescheduled to create fiscal space.The minister, however, clarified that Pakistan was seeking the re-profiling of payments and not ""haircuts"" - debt waiver or interest rate cuts.",Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund last month announced that it signed a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to provide a $7 billion loan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112099263,imgsize-856776,width-400,resizemode-4/112099263.jpg"
