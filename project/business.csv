"Inclusive measure falls short, 5-day window for home voting registration leaves seniors shortchanged",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inclusive-measure-falls-short-5-day-window-for-home-voting-regn-leaves-seniors-shortchanged/articleshow/114831913.cms,"MUMBAI :

Jimmy Dordi (85) was thrilled at the prospect of voting from home, a new EC initiative allowing seniors with limited mobility to participate in the democratic process without leaving their homes. But by the time he learned of the facility, the fiveday registration window slipped by, leaving him frustrated and unable to arrange for the paperwork in time. “The announcement came so suddenly. By the time I knew of it, I had no time to make arrangements,” Dordi shared from his Borivli room, where he’s largely confined to the bed and relies on a caregiver.The sentiment is shared by many seniors for whom voting remains a cherished duty but find themselves cut off by circumstance rather than choice. “Last time, my son took me but now I can’t walk. Even an auto ride is impossible,” said Dordi.For the first time, EC announced an at-home voting facility for citizens aged 85 and above for the LS polls this year, allowing them to cast a postal ballot . Many who long gave up hope of voting due to health issues took advantage of the opportunity. Officials visited their homes ahead of polling day to collect their votes. However, for the assembly polls, the short registration window—announced on Oct 22, with seniors and people with disabilities asked to register by October 27—left many struggling to complete the process for the inclusive measure in time.As of October 15, the state has 9.6 crore registered voters, including 13.15 lakh aged 85 and above, with 56.3 per cent of them female and 43.8 per cent male. The aim, according to officials, is to boost voter turnout in the state and encourage every eligible voter to cast their ballot, with the hope that the voting percentage in Maharashtra will exceed 70 per cent.When Yashwant Bagve (88), from Goregaon West, found out about the initiative, he was keen on using it but was frustrated by the tight dead line. “They only gave us five days. That’s not enough,” said Bagve, who lives alone and found that applying for the service was particularly challenging for seniors his age, who often struggle with mobility and other health issues.As for his voting plans now, Bagve, who has osteoarthritis, isn’t certain. “I might still go out to vote if the polling station is accessible. But if it’s on an upper floor, it will be very tough,” he said. “See, we want to participate but they need to make it a bit easier for us,” said Bagve, hopeful that more seniors will be accommodated in future elections.Andheri’s resident Chandrakant Doshi (89) plans to head to the polling station himself. “It’s close by, so I’ll manage,” he said confidently. But the at-home voting option, aservice his wife, Rama, has come to rely on, is more than a convenience or a civic duty; it’s about belonging to the community and a chance for seniors to stay engaged.“She’s 88, largely bedridden and doesn’t leave the house much anymore, but her right to vote is important to her, and she insisted on exercising it even if it had to be done right at home,” said Doshi, who is also working to spread the word to others in the community as head of a senior citizen activity centre in Andheri, where he regularly updates everyone on election facilities. “We’ve seen turnout drop over the years. So, facilities like this really help, especially for those who struggle to leave their homes.”A key challenge with the rollout, said Prakash Borgaonkar, CEO of Aaji Care Sevak Foundation and veteran advocate for elderly welfare for nearly four decades, was lack of awareness and communication channels. “When I reached out to many senior citizens , some didn’t even know about this option. And those who did, struggled with the process,” he said, pointing at a common concern among seniors today—proper implementation of govt schemes.“These are great ideas, but they need to materialize in real ways. For instance, a govt resolution was recently passed for Jestha Nagarik Mahamandal, a state senior citizens’ corporation, but when we followed up, it felt like just a pre-election formality. Nothing concrete on the ground,” said Borgaonkar, who is part of Maharashtra’s Joint Action Committee (JAC) comprising 26 organizations representing NGOs, researchers and gerontology experts. JAC has laid out an ambitious manifesto to reshape policies and programmes for senior citizens, who now make up nearly 12 per cent of Maharashtra’s population, and is proposing ‘councils’ at district and state levels with a mix of NGO members, academics and legal experts as well as seniors to keep these initiatives accountable.","For the first time, EC announced an at-home voting facility for citizens aged 85 and above for the LS polls this year.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a huge shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol.

'Zero tolerance on border compromise'

'In league of world's most modern military forces'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asserted that India will not compromise on even an inch of its borders. Celebrating Diwali with soldiers in Gujarat's Kutch region, the PM said that national policy aligns with the resolve of its armed forces. “We trust the determination of our soldiers, not the words of our enemies,” PM Modi said, adding that the people of India place their faith in the military’s strength to defend the country.PM Modi also emphasized his trust in their resolve over diplomatic assurances from adversaries.

Silver outshines gold for first time in festive season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silver-outshines-gold-for-first-time-in-festive-season/articleshow/114795481.cms,"HYDERABAD/MUMBAI: For the first time in the history of the Indian jewellery market , silver glittered more than gold this Dhanteras . As gold prices continued their record-breaking run, it dampened consumer demand. Shoppers instead rushed to buy silver."" Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras,"" Surendra Mehta, national secretary at Indian Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA), said. ""We are collating data for silver because this is the first time we are seeing such a huge demand,"" Mehta told TOI.For one, the high price of gold dissuaded many buyers and prompted them to look at silver instead. In addition to the demand for silver jewellery, the expected high industrial demand for the white metal - mainly from booming EV manufacturers - is making it the most sought-after precious metal now. ""People have now begun to understand that there is a real opportunity in investing in silver,"" Mehta added.While demand for silver during Dhanteras this year surged 30-35%, sales of gold were 15% lower at around 35-36 tonne as compared to 42 tonne last festive season. However, thanks to about a 30% rise in average price of the yellow metal, sales (in value terms) were higher at nearly Rs 28,000 crore from about Rs 24,000-25,000 crore last year.The World Gold Council too has projected that India's gold demand could hit a four-year low in 2024 due to the unprecedented record-breaking rally in prices. In Wednesday's mid-session, gold prices on NYMEX went above the $2,800-per-ounce mark for the first time in history on the back of global uncertainties relating to geopolitical issues, the US election, as well as continuing demand from central banks and the solar energy industry.Gold demand in India - the world's secon-biggest consumer of the precious metal - could stand between 700 tonne and 750 tonne in 2024, the lowest since 2020 and down from last year's 761 tonne, Sachin Jain, regional CEO (India) at WGC, was quoted as saying by Reuters.In the local market and commodities exchange, gold price was hovering above the Rs 80,000 per 10 gram level, while silver prices stayed above the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark.Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst (commodities) at HDFC Securities, said that gold's record on Wednesday came after the US treasury yields and the dollar fell following mixed US macro data.",Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras.

This tradition, aimed at fostering goodwill between the neighboring nations, came just one day after a crucial disengagement process was completed at two long standing friction points, Demchok and Depsang Plains, in eastern Ladakh.The Diwali exchanges took place at five Border Personnel Meeting (BPM) points along the LAC. “Sweets were exchanged between Indian and Chinese troops along several border points along the LAC on the occasion of Diwali,” an army source told PTI.This latest disengagement at Demchok and Depsang Plains follows months of high-level diplomatic and military talks aimed at de-escalating tensions that began in 2020. During these discussions, officials from both nations sought to restore the ground situation through equitable security measures, leading to this latest consensus.Speaking at an event in Assam’s Tezpur earlier today, defence minister Rajnath Singh expressed optimism regarding the de-escalation efforts. “Based on this consensus, the disengagement process is nearly complete. We will strive to move beyond just disengagement, but for that, we will need to wait a little longer,” he said.Chinese ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, shared similar sentiments, highlighting the importance of managing and resolving differences constructively. “It is natural for neighboring countries like India and China to have differences, but the focus should be on how we handle these,” Xu remarked, adding that the successful disengagement at Demchok and Depsang sets a positive tone for future cooperation in politics, business, and education.After the de-escalation, Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a formal meeting, their first structured discussion in five years, on the sidelines of Brics summit in Russia.The leaders reaffirmed the importance of maintaining stable relations, citing the benefits to both Indian and Chinese citizens as well as to regional and global peace.","Indian and Chinese troops exchanged sweets at several points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to mark festival of Diwali.

Airfares on flights between India and the US are typically high this time of the year, but with the cancellations, fares are set to jump further. This increase will affect fares not only on non-stop flights between these two countries but also on flights that involve a transit halt in a third country.Among the flights cancelled are those from Delhi to destinations such as Washington, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, and then from Mumbai to New York, said sources. At present, AI is the only Indian carrier that operates flights between India and the US. In a statement, AI said the cancellations were made “due to the delayed return of some aircraft from heavy maintenance and supply chain constraints resulting in a temporary reduction in operating fleet”.“Air India regrets that a small number of flights have been cancelled between now and the end of December. Affected customers have been informed and offered flights on other Air India group services operating on the same or adjacent days, a free change to any other date, or a full refund. Air India sincerely regrets the inconvenience caused by this constraint beyond our control,” said an AI spokesperson.","Tata Group-owned Air India has cancelled about 60 US flights scheduled for the peak travel season of Nov and Dec.

India may face 25% GDP loss by '70 due to climate change: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-may-face-25-gdp-loss-by-70-due-to-climate-change-study/articleshow/114829518.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: Climate change under a high-end emissions scenario could lead to a 16.9% loss in GDP by 2070 across the Asia and Pacific region, with India projected to suffer a 24.7% GDP loss , according to a new report. Rising sea levels and decreasing labour productivity would drive the most significant losses, with lower-income and fragile economies being hit the hardest, it said. The new research, presented in the inaugural issue of ADB 's "" Asia-Pacific Climate Report"", details a series of damaging impacts threatening the region.It says that if the climate crisis continues to accelerate, up to 300 million people in the region could be at risk from coastal inundation, and trillions of dollars' worth of coastal assets could face annual damage by 2070.""Climate change has supercharged the devastation from tropical storms, heat waves, and floods in the region, contributing to unprecedented economic challenges and human suffering,"" said ADB president Masatsugu Asakawa.Urgent, well-coordinated climate action addressing these impacts is necessary before it is too late, he said.This climate report provides insights into financing urgent adaptation needs and offers promising policy recommendations to governments in our developing member countries on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest cost, he added. ""By 2070, climate change under a high-end emissions scenario could cause a total loss of 16.9% of GDP across the Asia and Pacific region. Most of the region would face more than 20%. The report said that developing Asia has accounted for most of the increase in global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions since 2000. While advanced economies were major GHG emitters throughout the 20th century, emissions from Asia have risen more rapidly than those from any other region in the first two decades of the 21st century.""Consequently, the region's share of global emissions rose from 29.4% in 2000 to 45.9% in 2021... Emissions from Asia continue to rise, driven primarily by China, which contributed about 30 per cent of global emissions in 2021,"" the ADB report said.The report pointed out that the region is home to 60 per cent of the world's population, with per capita emissions still below the global average.Intensified and more variable rainfall, along with increasingly extreme storms, will lead to more frequent landslides and floods in the region, it said. ""This will be most pronounced in mountainous and steeply sloped areas, such as the border area of India and China, where landslides may increase by 30%-70% under 4.7 degrees Celsius of mean global warming,"" it said.","Climate change under a high-end emissions scenario could lead to a 16.9% loss in GDP by 2070 across the Asia and Pacific region.

KOLKATA: History sheets , voluminous registers kept at police stations, profiling criminals and their aides, will now have to wipe out names of minors, random inclusions of innocent people just because they are socially and economically backward. The pre-Independence Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, will now be amended after Supreme Court spelt out five-point guidelines in a case involving Delhi Police to maintain history sheets, and asked states to replicate ""Delhi model"".It has also stressed that these will be internal police documents which can never be made public.Pursuant to a May 7 order by the SC, the Bengal Police on October 24 issued guidelines on ""disclosing identities of individuals connected with the offender in the history sheet"". The new guidelines stop random inclusion of names in the history sheet and make it clear only those people will be named in the history sheets who can aid and shelter a criminal on the run. Names of minors have to be wiped out, even if they are in conflict with law or child witnesses.Importantly, the new guidelines bar police from ""mechanical entries"" of innocents just because they are poor, uneducated and happen to belong from backwards classes, SCs or STs. It also makes it clear that the history sheet is an ""internal police document"" and not a ""publicly accessible report"".According to the regulation 401 (a) PRB 1943, the history sheet is defined as: ""History sheets shall contain a short account of the life of the person to whom they relate and all facts likely to have a bearing on his criminal history. They shall be opened only for persons who are, or are likely to become, habitual criminals or the aiders or abettors of such criminals.""The SC directions were made in a case titled Amanatullah Khan versus Commissioner of Police, Delhi. Khan had moved court asking his history sheet to be deleted. Prodded by the SC, the Delhi Police submitted its revised rules on maintaining history sheets.","The pre-Independence Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, will now be amended.

Initial Contact: Scammers first send an SMS, email, or a WhatsApp text. The message states that the recipient's name or phone number is linked to criminal acts like pornography, drug peddling or money laundering . They are instructed to call a specific number to avoid ' digital arrest '.Impersonation via video calls: Once the victim responds, scammers initiate a video call over platforms like Skype or WhatsApp, posing as officials from agencies like Maharashtra police, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), or Customs. Scammers use appropriate uniforms, background props like govt flags, logos, or VHF radio sounds to make the video call look legitimate.False accusations: During the call, scammers accuse the victim of serious crimes such as money laundering, involvement in illegal drug distribution, or receiving contraband goods. Sometimes, fraudsters posing as cops claim that a family member is under arrest or has been implicated.Continuous surveillance and intimidation: Scammers maintain a constant presence on the call, demanding the victim stays on video as a form of 'monitoring' or 'verification'. The modus operandi is to keep the victim in a heightened state of fear and pressure, restricting them from consulting with others or thinking clearly.Extortion for resolution: Once the victim is sufficiently intimidated, the scammers demand money to 'clear' the charges. Cyber fraudsters instruct the victim to transfer large sums of money to accounts provided by them, which are generally mule accounts.Be Skeptical: Legitimate govt agencies will not conduct investigations or arrests via video call.Safeguard personal information: Avoid sharing sensitive data that can be exploited.Never transfer money: Law enforcement agencies do not demand payments for case dismissal.Report suspicious calls: Immediately report any suspicious interaction to local police or use cybercrime helplines like 1930 or report the matter at cybercrime.gov.in.Gather evidence: People who receive these calls should record or take screenshots of suspicious conversations as potential evidence.Retired consultant loses Rs 2 crore: Hyderabad resident AV Mohan Rao, a 79-year-old retired consultant, lost Rs 2 crore to scammers posing as officers from Mumbai Police.

KOLHAPUR: Many villages in the state have been celebrating Diwali without bursting firecrackers, a practice they have been following for over a decade at least. Residents in many villages refrain from bursting crackers even during marriage functions and public festivities. Borade, a village in Dhule district, Manyachiwadi village in Satara district, and Langarpeth and Padali villages in Sangli district have banned firecrackers.Manyachiwadi in Satara district is the first “solar village” in Maharashtra. “Our village was among the first to ban firecrackers not just during Diwali but also during other festivities and private functions nearly 20 years ago. We hold other events to mark Diwali, and we ensure that the festival is celebrated without air and noise pollution. We come together and light diyas. The awareness about side effects of firecrackers has been passed down from one generation to another, owing to which we do not have to make any further effort to achieve the goal of cracker-free Diwali,” said Ravindra Mane, the sarpanch of Manyachiwadi.Since last year, Satara Zilla Parishad has appealed to village panchayats to celebrate cracker-free Diwali. A programme based on the five elements of life — earth, water, air, fire, and sky — has been designed, and those villages that undertake such initiatives are given points. Based on the points, additional grants are provided to gram panchayats for development works.Jaysing Pawara, a resident of Boradi village in Dhule, said, “Around 15 years ago, we passed a resolution to avoid use of firecrackers. We have enough awareness that water and air should not be polluted, and nature is sacrosanct for us. We have a fine for violators. We hold competitions and games to engage youths during Diwali.” Langarpeth grampanchayat has fixed a fine of Rs 2,000 for every violation of firecracker ban .","Residents in many villages refrain from bursting crackers even during marriage functions and public festivities.

Earlier, only poor and vulnerable families and a few specific categories of workers, like ASHA staff, were eligible for the scheme that offers health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary-care hospitalisation.Anyone aged 70 years or above can apply for the Ayushman Bharat Senior Citizen Scheme on the website, www.beneficiary.nha.gov.in, or by using the Ayushman App (available for Android on the Google Play Store). Beneficiaries simply need to verify their identity and eligibility through Aadhaar e-KYC . Aadhaar serves as the primary document for confirming both the beneficiary’s age and state of residence and is the only document required to complete the registration process.Yes. Family members can register the eligible an beneficiary through beneficiary login option on the mobile app and website. All they must do is to enter their mobile number and put in the OTP that’s generated to initiate the enrolment process. One can also visit the nearest empanelled hospital and get themselves enrolled.AB PM-JAY is a completely cashless scheme, and govt sources said payments are made to hospitals against the treatment provided to eligible beneficiaries. Empanelled hospitals are mandated to offer cashless treatment to beneficiaries. One can lodge grievances on the AB PM-JAY website or through the national call centre ‘14555’, mail, letter, fax etc. Any complaint regarding denial of treatment by an empaneled hospital is to be seen as an SOS grievance and a ‘turn around time’ of 6 hours has been set for resolving it.Such beneficiaries will have to re-initiate their Aadhaar based e-KYC via the website or mobile app to be registered as a beneficiary under the senior citizen scheme.The list of empanelled hospitals for Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme is available on the website www.dashboard.pmjay.gov.in. As of Sept 30, approximately 30,000 hospitals across the country are empanelled to provide benefits under the scheme, which is run overall by the National Health Authority. The list includes 190 leading corporate hospitals like Centre For Sight (Delhi), Medanta-The Medicity (Gurugram), Metro Hospital and Heart Institute (Noida), Fortis Escorts Hospital (Jaipur), Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital & Heart Institute (Ghaziabad), etc.Public health and hospitals being a state subject under the Indian Constitution, state health agencies (SHAs) are mandated to empanel hospitals under Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY.Beneficiaries can visit any empanelled hospital, present either their Ayushman card or their PMJAY ID to receive treatment. Before visiting, the beneficiary should confirm that the hospital is empanelled to treat the specific condition for which they require assistance.Nearly all treatments covered by the scheme cost below Rs 2 lakh and, so, the Rs 5 lakh cover is sufficient to meet beneficiaries’ healthcare needs, govt sources said. Further, under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN), financial assistance up to Rs 15 lakh is provided to patients from poor families — who are eligible for PM-JAY — for availing those treatments that are not covered under PM-JAY. Hence, AB PM-JAY along with other central govt schemes can take care of hospitalisation needs of eligible beneficiaries.No. With these states not implementing the scheme, elderly citizens cannot join or receive the benefits of AB PM-JAY.","Those aged 70 years and above can now benefit from the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.

Let's celebrate by lighting diyas and sharing sweets, but we must avoid crackers to protect the children and elderly at home.""Gopal Rai further emphasized, ""I believe that if the people of Delhi avoid burning crackers, the city will not witness the usual post-Diwali smog . I request everyone to avoid crackers and the pollution they cause, to ensure everyone at home remains safe.""When asked about the sale of crackers in the city, Rai mentioned increased patrolling by Delhi Police to monitor the situation at night. ""The police are actively working to control the sale of crackers. Patrolling will be increased at night for safety. But I still ask, why is it necessary to burn crackers? As human beings, it's our duty not to pollute the city,"" he stated.The Delhi government is closely monitoring the situation, with Rai adding, ""We are addressing incidents of firecracker use, and the police are working on this on the ground. Such activities at night will also be addressed. But more than enforcement, it's our duty to protect our environment. We are monitoring everything, and the Delhi government will take necessary steps as the situation demands.""","A thick smog covered parts of Delhi on Friday, the day after Diwali, leading the city's air quality to deteriorate to the'very poor' category. At around 7am, the AQI readings were 395 in Anand Vihar, 352 in Aya Nagar, 390 in Jahangirpuri, and 376 in Dwarka. Several other cities, including Chennai and Mumbai, reported similar conditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114832604,imgsize-59182,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114832604.jpg"

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

SpaceX gets into spy game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spacex-gets-into-spy-game/articleshow/114831007.cms,"SpaceX ceo Elon Musk

WASHINGTON: The breakthrough came last month, about 600 miles above Earth. For the first time, the Pentagon 's Space Development Agency used lasers to more securely transmit data at light speed between military satellites , making it easier to track enemy missiles and if necessary shoot them down.It was a milestone not only for the Pentagon. This was a defining moment for a certain up-and-coming military contractor that had built key parts of this new system: Elon Musk 's SpaceX. SpaceX over the past year started to move in a big way into the business of building military and spy satellites , an industry that has long been dominated by major contractors like Raytheon and Northrop Grumman as well as smaller players like York Space Systems.This shift comes as the Pentagon and US spy agencies are preparing to spend billions of dollars to build a series of new constellations of low-Earth-orbit satellites, much of it in response to recent moves by China to build its own space-based military systems. SpaceX is poised to capitalize on that, generating a new wave of questions inside the federal govt about the company's growing dominance as a military space contractor and Musk's extensive business operations in China and his relations with foreign government leaders, possibly including Russian President Vladimir Putin.Musk is also unpredictable in a sector in which security is often perceived to be synonymous with predictability. He chafes at many of the processes and rules of government, saying they hold back progress, and wants to make his own calls.""The complication is that you're incredibly dependent on a company that is privately held, meaning we have very little visibility into their finances,"" said Todd Harrison, a former space industry executive who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.","Elon Musk's SpaceX is moving into the business of building military and spy satellites.

Commitment to safety and community



From tech innovator to mayoral candidate



Karthik Naralasetty has long been recognized for his innovative work in technology and social change. From founding Socialblood , a platform that connects blood donors through social media, to advocating for safe communities, Naralasetty’s journey reflects a commitment to making an impact. Now, he’s taking his mission a step further by running for mayor in Texas, hoping to bring his vision to life for the people of The Hills , according to naralasetty.org.Originally from Guntur in Andhra Pradesh , Karthik completed his early education in Delhi before moving to the US to study at Rutgers University. His election would mark a historic moment for The Hills and Texas, as he would be the city’s youngest mayor and the first of Indian descent.Running for office in such a setting has proven challenging. Karthik reports enduring personal attacks and describes the campaign atmosphere as “disheartening and hostile.”“The bullying, personal attacks, and character assassinations I’ve encountered are disappointing, but they strengthen my resolve to focus on what matters: serving the people of The Hills with integrity,” Karthik said.He emphasized his commitment to “bring positive change, listen to all voices, and ensure every resident feels valued.”Karthik’s campaign, he shared, centers around “building an inclusive future where everyone in The Hills feels seen and valued.”“My Indian-American background gives me a unique perspective to bridge cultural gaps and make The Hills a place where diverse voices are celebrated. As mayor, I will preserve our community’s cherished character while embracing progress in safety, technology, and community engagement,” he asserted.Having originally moved from India and lived in fast-paced cities, 35-year-old Naralasetty relocated to The Hills seeking a safer, more connected community for his family. ""Our move wasn’t part of the Covid wave of relocations; it was driven by the terrifying experience of a shootout right outside our home while our two children were inside. That day, we realized that we needed to make a change to ensure the safety and well-being of our family,"" he said.Since settling in The Hills, Naralasetty has become a local advocate, dedicated to enhancing the community’s sense of security and togetherness. His experiences have strengthened his resolve to uphold safety for all residents, a central theme in his mayoral campaign. “We chose The Hills because we wanted a place where our children could grow up free from fear, and I promise to uphold the safety that drew us here every day,” he said.As the founder of Socialblood, Naralasetty demonstrated how technology could serve humanitarian causes. Now, he’s applying that same dedication to his mayoral campaign, aiming to support sustainable growth, safety, and community well-being in The Hills. His vision resonates with residents who seek a leader that values both innovation and the close-knit community spirit The Hills is known for.Karthik Naralasetty’s journey from tech entrepreneur to community advocate to mayoral candidate is driven by a purpose: to create a thriving, safe, and connected community. His campaign is grounded in the values of progress, family, and unity, which he hopes to champion for Texas residents as their future mayor.","Karthik Naralasetty, 35, is running for mayor of The Hills, Texas.

China's unease: Halloween's growing popularity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-unease-halloweens-growing-popularity/articleshow/114761747.cms,"In Shanghai this Halloween, police presence was unmissable and their vigilance palpable. (AI image for representation only).

Driving the news

According to reports, Chinese authorities are targeting revelers in Shanghai who gathered in popular nightlife spots dressed in Halloween costumes.

who gathered in popular nightlife spots dressed in Halloween costumes. Videos circulating on social media show police imposing crowd control and restricting pedestrian flow, in some cases, escorting costumed partygoers—including those dressed as Donald Trump and superheroes like Batman and Superman—away from public spaces, news report said.

The scene contrasts sharply with last year’s festivities, which drew widespread attention and even a nod from the Shanghai municipal government as a symbol of ""cultural tolerance.""

A bar and restaurant owner in the Jing An nightlife district of Shanghai was asked to sign an agreement issued by the local district authorities pledging they would not organise any activities such as costume contests ""to maintain good social order and public image"", he told Reuters.

However, with tightened restrictions this year, social media users have expressed concerns that Halloween, once an opportunity for social commentary, is becoming another casualty in the narrowing space for personal freedom in China.

The news of Shanghai's crackdown on Halloween was a trending topic on Chinese social media sites, including Weibo.

""Even in relatively open Shanghai, the scale of freedom is constantly shrinking,"" one user posted.

Why it matters

Halloween has gained popularity among young Chinese in recent years as a platform for self-expression, a rare outlet in an otherwise tightly controlled society. Since last year's celebrations openly mocked government policies through costumes—like hazmat suits symbolizing strict Covid-19 lockdowns—the Chinese government is likely wary that the festival could ignite further expressions of dissent or even inspire protests akin to the rare, anti-lockdown demonstrations from last year.

Authorities in Shanghai seem determined to prevent any recurrence of last year’s outspoken festivities, which could signal a broader crackdown on public gatherings and, more subtly, on displays of Western cultural influence.

The big picture

China's youth unemployment, currently high, and general economic stagnation have led to widespread frustration, and last year, many used Halloween as a way to express these concerns.

Some students dressed as unemployed graduates, while others donned costumes poking fun at government restrictions.

The mood mirrored a wider, underlying discontent, exacerbated by the pandemic’s lingering economic effects and the government's strict zero-Covid measures, which only lifted last year.

With this year’s tighter restrictions, analysts suggest authorities are aiming to curb any gathering that could serve as a platform for social criticism, particularly after the White Paper Protests in 2022, when young people took to the streets to challenge pandemic policies and highlight issues from economic stagnation to censorship.

The crackdown on Halloween is viewed by many as a preemptive measure to deter similar forms of public expression.

Zoom in: Halloween 2022 vs 2023

Between the lines

The bottom line

While Halloween celebrations were once a sign of Shanghai’s “cultural tolerance,” the restrictions this year suggest that China’s social landscape may be narrowing under tightened controls.

For China’s young people, who once saw the holiday as a chance to voice their frustrations, the crackdown serves as a stark reminder of the limits on public expression in an increasingly monitored society. The question now is whether this Halloween marks the beginning of a new phase in China’s oversight of public gatherings—and what it means for young Chinese eager to express themselves, even within the limited bounds of a Western holiday.

As Michael Luo put it, “It’s obviously a very happy holiday. Even though it’s foreign culture, it’s still quite fun.” For now, however, that fun seems overshadowed by the mounting restrictions shaping life in China’s most cosmopolitan city.

What’s next

The government’s approach raises questions about the future of Halloween—and similar Western-inspired events—in China. Although some official celebrations went ahead at theme parks like Shanghai Disneyland , smaller gatherings at bars and parks faced restrictions, and local authorities discouraged costume-themed gatherings.

, smaller gatherings at bars and parks faced restrictions, and local authorities discouraged costume-themed gatherings. Shanghai Disneyland, however, proceeded with its annual Halloween event, drawing significant attention as one of the few venues spared from restrictions. Still, many wonder if even these authorized events might come under scrutiny if Halloween continues to serve as a platform for social commentary.

The government’s wariness of gatherings perceived as implicitly critical of policies could extend to other Western-inspired events like Christmas, which has also gained traction in Chinese cities.

Chinese authorities have shown unprecedented concern over Halloween celebrations this year, implementing stricter controls and issuing warnings across major cities. This heightened scrutiny stems from several factors affecting the nation's social and cultural landscape.This year, videos posted on Chinese social media show officers actively targeting people in costumes, asking some to remove makeup or refrain from wearing “bizarre” clothing. As per a New York Times report, Shanghai resident Michael Luo, a bar owner, voiced frustration over the crackdown, calling it “a waste of resources.” He added that authorities should focus on ensuring public safety and enjoyment rather than stifling celebrations, which are popular even in non-Westernized settings like China.In contrast, some netizens on Weibo expressed disappointment at the heavy police presence, lamenting the restriction of cultural events. “Shanghai is not supposed to be like this,” one user wrote, criticizing the city’s perceived shift from tolerance to repression, the CNN report said.Last year’s Halloween in Shanghai was notable not just for its turnout but for its tone—many young people used costumes to comment on China’s social and economic landscape. A popular costume last year featured blank sheets of paper, an ironic reference to China’s censorship, while others dressed as Covd testers or stock market crash victims. Revelers created a carnival-like atmosphere that had not been seen since the end of lockdowns, and authorities initially tolerated the display, acknowledging it as a form of “cultural exchange.”This year, however, any form of “edginess” appears off-limits. Barriers were set up on Julu Road, a popular Halloween spot, and police patrols deterred would-be revelers, effectively halting celebrations.Some partygoers reported being escorted to police stations, where they were asked to remove their costumes before being allowed to leave. Videos show that police focused their actions on people wearing costumes, while those in everyday clothing were left unbothered.China’s tightening stance on Halloween can be seen as part of a broader skepticism toward Western cultural traditions, which the government often frames as a potential threat to Chinese social values. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under President Xi Jinping has intensified its focus on promoting Chinese culture, criticizing foreign festivals as “overly passionate” distractions. Chinese state media, in particular, has been vocal in recent years about resisting Western influence, and Halloween, with its American origins, has become a particular target.Some scholars, such as Alfred Wu of the National University of Singapore, argue that the government is attempting to reshape Chinese society by stifling gatherings that may incite social discontent. Wu remarked, “The authorities are far more prepared this year,” citing the likely intention to prevent any repeat of last year’s protest-like festivities.(With inputs from agencies)","Chinese authorities are targeting revelers in Shanghai dressed in Halloween costumes.

'Wisdom of crowds': Could political betting swing the US election?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polymarket-betting-market-musk/articleshow/114817885.cms,"Historically, political betting is impressively accurate.

The problem of reflexivity

Self-fulfilling prophecies

As the 1549 papal conclave dragged on into a second and third month, Venice’s ambassador to the Vatican, Matteo Dandolo, was outraged by insider trading. “It is more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll,” he said, “and that the cardinals’ attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands.”Although the conclave was supposedly secret, Roman traders ran a thriving market in the streets around the Vatican trying to predict the winner. Odds shifted rapidly, and bettors appeared suspiciously well informed and perceptive. Everyone knew the race was wide open, and the original favorite in the crowded field, at 5-to-1 against (or 17% odds), was Cardinal Giovanni Maria del Monte. Ten weeks later, he was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate, but only after opposing cardinals had brought forward a parade of options. Bettors on the streets helped the population understand who was leading, and by spotting early on that Julius might be the inoffensive candidate who would provoke the least opposition, they even guided the cardinals as they tried to break the deadlock.Prediction markets grew so widespread and so disliked that by the end of the 16th century, Pope Gregory XIV had outlawed them. The penalty for betting on the identity of the next pope was excommunication.Five centuries later, the urge to bet on elections has not abated. Neither has the whiff of corruption surrounding them, nor the sense that bettors’ money can move not just markets but election results themselves. For centuries there have been cycles of political betting — in 19th century Pall Mall clubs, and in the early 20th century on the floors of the New York and London stock exchanges — punctuated by moves to ban them. As the 2024 presidential campaign drives towards a bitter conclusion, the cycle is repeating.This time the ultimate authority is not the pope but the US Supreme Court. At present, the US’s biggest political betting markets are offshore. The only legal, regulated entities are nonprofits run as academic experiments with tight limits on how much can be wagered — the best known are the Iowa Electronic Markets and PredictIt.com, which operates in the US under the auspices of Victoria University in New Zealand. Now, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is fighting an attempt to set up a legal onshore political futures market, which would allow Americans to take part without limits on how much they can trade.In the latest round, the for-profit Kalshi futures market won a stay against the CFTC’s ban that cleared the way for a huge experiment. The litigation could go on for years, but Kalshi can run a market on this year’s election, and its odds now appear in huge neon lights above Times Square. This has prompted established brokers to get in on the act; Interactive Brokers also launched political futures trading for the election.The world’s richest man is paying attention. Earlier this month, Elon Musk urged his followers on the online platform X, which he owns, to follow the offshore venue Polymarket (launched by his former colleague Peter Thiel). “More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line,” he wrote. At the time, Polymarket showed Donald Trump ’s chances at 50.1%. Hours later, and with no relevant news, a still-anonymous French investor made the first of a series of giant trades now totaling some $45 million on a Trump win, pushing his odds way up. Ten days later, with Kamala Harris still ahead in polls of polls, Trump’s chances had surged to 62.2%.PredictIt, populated mostly by academics limited to stakes of $850, also raised Trump’s chances, but at a much slower pace. The press was more interested in Polymarket. Since Musk’s tweet it has featured in 10 times more news stories than PredictIt. Polymarket’s odds helped change the narrative in markets where far more money is at stake. Treasury yields and share prices both rose, as traders started pricing in a Trump win and the corporate tax cuts that would come with it.Like all markets, popular prediction markets are prone to what the hedge fund manager George Soros calls “reflexivity.” Rather than just reflecting or reacting to facts on the ground, moves in bonds, stocks or oil markets can actually change that reality. It is this fear that animates opposition to Kalshi. The pressure group Better Markets, an amicus in the CFTC’s suit, asserts that manipulating these markets could shift the facts. Cantrell Dumas, its director of derivatives policy, says that if the markets are taken seriously and show that one candidate is likely to win “people could stay home and not vote for their preferred candidate.”On the other side, Kalshi’s supporters argue that manipulation is a problem for all markets, and the key is regulation. David Mason, general counsel of PredictIt and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission argues, “these manipulation problems are dealt with in regulated markets every day. There are trading exclusions; if they have material non-public information then they are prohibited from trading. Kalshi has a long list of people who aren’t allowed to trade.”But Dumas rejects the comparison. “In a traditional market, if a regulator sees manipulation and takes action, it has remedies. With election manipulation that changes the result, that’s irreparable harm. It’s a fundamental distinction,” he told me.The excitement since Musk’s tweet looks very much like reflexivity in action. And social change has amplified the potential reflexive power of markets. We are now far more inclined to trust in the “wisdom of crowds.” Most importantly, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, developed in the 1950s and the basis for much modern finance, holds that markets continuously incorporate all information, and so they can’t be consistently beaten, except by insiders who know something others don’t. Central to the argument for investing passively in indexes and exchange-traded funds, this idea can transmogrify into a belief that markets can’t be wrong.Historically, political betting is impressively accurate. The academics Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz demonstrated 20 years ago that over history, markets had come closer to getting presidential elections right (with an average error of 1.5%) than the Gallup poll, which was on average off by 2.1%. Market discipline should help experts thrash out a better consensus estimate, and many companies now run internal prediction markets to improve forecasting. Wikipedia and Google have convinced us that crowd-sourcing information can work, and popular culture is saturated with tales of brilliant statisticians, like Michael Lewis’ 2003 book Moneyball on how the Oakland A’s used statistics to spot good players others had missed. Nate Silver, an adviser to Polymarket, made his name as a baseball statistician.Then there’s what Wall Streeters call the Elaine Garzarelli Effect: We tend to place excessive trust in whichever guru made a good call last time. As a Lehman Brothers investment strategist, Garzarelli brilliantly urged clients to get out of the stock market the week before the Black Monday crash in 1987. That made her one of the most widely quoted strategists on the Street; her words would move markets, and she compiled a good track record. But she was fallible — in December 2007, on the eve of the global financial crisis, she proclaimed that stocks were undervalued by 25% — and people lost interest.In politics, the offshore Intrade prediction market developed a Garzarelli effect after calling 49 states correctly in 2008, and then all 50 — amid much attention — in 2012. Then regulators shut it down, but other venues rose to replace it. The market odds on a Donald Trump victory were about 35% on election night in 2016.Betting markets may also have grown more reflexive because the legalization of sports betting has made gambling socially acceptable, while investing looks ever more like gambling. Baseball banned Shoeless Joe Jackson and Pete Rose for life over wagering on the sport. Now, Major League Baseball has its own formal spread-betting partner. Investment apps now resemble video games: Robinhood.com drove the meme stock craze of 2021 as people poured stimulus checks, and a lot of political anger, into bets on companies like GameStop Corp. While papal envoys disdained people betting in the street, our current society has little problem with people trading elections on their phones.Reflexivity is amplified by a constant of human nature; our psychological need for an anchor. We want a number, and once we have one we cling to it, because it gives us an illusion of control. The idea of anchoring has been a staple of behavioral finance since it was first applied to economics by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky 50 years ago. Their experiments showed that people’s answers to numeric questions can be skewed just by showing them a number at random before they answer. In the unmoored climate of a polarized election that appears to be in a dead heat, our desire for an anchor will naturally grow.In the UK’s Brexit referendum, betting markets put the chances that Britons would vote to leave the EU at one in five. Statisticians David Rothschild and Andrew Gelman argued afterwards that there was “a feedback mechanism whereby the betting-market odds reify themselves.” People distrusted polls, they said, but “we do watch the prediction markets, which all sorts of experts have assured us capture the wisdom of crowds.” Pollsters and pundits — and even the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage — were “to some extent anchoring themselves off the prediction odds,” and dismissed polls that showed Brexit in the lead. The clue, Rothschild and Gelman argued, was that a “mature prediction market should show measured, but real, swings in prices in response to news,” but the Brexit odds stayed weirdly stable.Polls closed with the market odds of Brexit at 31%. When they were proved wrong, the pound dropped by more than 10% in a matter of minutes — more than treble its previous worst fall. Brexit looks very much like a classic example of Soros’ reflexivity at work — and on the face of it, suggests that the CFTC is amply justified in trying to keep political betting out of mainstream investment.The CFTC’s problem is that the other markets it regulates exist to help manage risks, from fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates to the possibility of a catastrophic hurricane. Investors wish to insure against political surprises — with the fallout from the Brexit vote showing why they might be sensible. So how to allow that, while limiting the chance of either deliberate manipulation or innocent irrational exuberance which, with reflexivity, could turn markets into a tool for changing election results? There are two plausible solutions.The first, advocated by Kalshi and Polymarket, is to make markets liquid by attracting more money. With billions at stake, no individual can move the market. But for now, while they remain on a smaller scale, whales can make a big splash.The alternative is to limit liquidity. PredictIt’s $850 limit on stakes thwarts whales. A rich person’s views don’t count for more just because they’re rich. But it’s harder to move the price when genuine news happens, and it reduces the market’s usefulness as a place to manage risk. Limited markets might produce the public good of more robust predictions, but a multi-trillion dollar manager like BlackRock cannot hedge a given election result on PredictIt.Recent experiences with opening new markets have shown how difficult this can be. In the decade before the global financial crisis, quants spotted that emerging markets and commodity futures tended to gain over time, with a low correlation to stocks and bonds. That sounded like the holy grail for asset allocators, and big institutions piled in. Once they did so, however, they changed the way these markets behaved and interacted. If money moved into copper as a result of a deliberate decision to move out of bonds, for example, it was inevitable that bonds and copper would grow more correlated, which they did. In 2008, stocks, commodities and emerging markets all crashed together.Similarly, once big financial hedgers and/or wealthy individuals arrive in betting markets, there’s no reason to assume those markets will keep behaving the same way. Treasury bonds, oil or tech stocks are deep markets combining people with many different motivations, and the messages they send should be taken very seriously; Kalshi, Polymarket and others are far from that scale.There’s also the eternal issue of Garbage In, Garbage Out. Markets synthesize information and give participants an incentive to sniff out fake news. But they aren’t a protection against bad information — if the polls are wrong, markets will be wrong.If well regulated, political prediction markets might yet provide probabilities that help guide us in times of uncertainty. But like all markets they will be prone to get things wrong, and while they remain largely unregulated, it behooves us to be careful. The threat of excommunication doesn’t deter miscreants the way it once did.","Historically, political betting is impressively accurate.

The former palace of Bangladesh's ex-leader Sheikh Hasina will be converted into a museum to commemorate the revolution that led to her removal, according to the country's current caretaker government leader, Muhammad Yunus Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, made this announcement during his tour of the Ganabhaban palace , which used to be the prime minister's official residence. ""The museum should preserve memories of her misrule and the people's anger when they removed her from power,"" Yunus said.Sheikh Hasina, who ruled for 15 years, was ousted on August 5 following a student-led uprising. She fled to India via helicopter. Her tenure was marked by human rights abuses, including mass detention and extrajudicial killings. A Bangladeshi court has issued an arrest warrant for her.Prior to Hasina's downfall, over 700 individuals were killed, many in a brutal police crackdown.
