It is with a heavy heart that I write this tribute to Bhaskar Das , a remarkable individual whose life was a shining example of humility, kindness, and boundless curiosity. His passing has left a void that words cannot fill, but his legacy will continue to inspire all those fortunate enough to have known him.Just a few days ago, Malcolm Raphael , my friend and one of BD’s ex-TOI colleagues, and I visited BD’s home to hand over the prasad from a special Mritunjaya Homam that I had arranged at Sri Ayyappa Sangham temple for his well-being.Shoma, his gracious wife, accepted it on his behalf as BD was under heavy sedation due to the pain of his advanced cancer. As much as I wanted to see him, part of me felt relieved. It would have been heartwrenching to see the vibrant, energetic BD I had known for over 25 years in that fragile state.This photo, taken by Impact, 13 years ago, perfectly captures the BD I admired—a man full of life, always eager to learn, and deeply committed to helping others. When I was starting out as a young media planner and buyer, the Times of India was a mighty force in the industry, and BD held a senior position within its ranks. Yet, despite his stature, he was always willing to guide and support me without a second thought about titles or hierarchies. That generosity became the first strategic pillar of our long and meaningful relationship.Even when I ventured into entrepreneurship, BD’s humility and curiosity stood out. I remember a conversation where he expressed a desire to be part of the projects we were working on—not for personal gain, but simply to learn and grow. That was the essence of BD: a man who believed that life’s greatest wealth lay in knowledge, relationships, and contribution.Shoma shared with me that even as recently as January 6th, BD was writing work notes, determined to stay connected to his passion. His ambition to work until his last breath speaks volumes about his dedication and purpose. At 72, BD lived a life that Shoma described as “worthy of celebration.” It’s a sentiment I deeply resonate with.Beyond his professional achievements, what made BD truly extraordinary was his ability to connect with people. He listened intently, shared generously, and left a lasting impression on everyone he met. He showed us that leadership is not about power but about empowering others, and that success is not measured by accolades but by the lives you touch.As I reflect on his life, I’m struck by the profound lessons it holds for all of us. BD reminds us to embrace life with purpose, to remain curious no matter how much we’ve achieved, and to find joy in the journey. His story is a testament to the fact that a life lived with humility, grace, and intention can leave an impact far greater than we can imagine.Though BD is no longer with us, his spirit endures in the memories and hearts of those who loved and respected him. Let us honor his memory by striving to embody the values he stood for: humility, kindness, lifelong learning, and a commitment to uplifting those around us.Rest in peace, Bhaskar Da. You will be deeply missed, but your legacy will live on, inspiring us to live fuller, more meaningful lives.","Bhaskar Das was a remarkable individual whose life was a shining example of humility, kindness, and boundless curiosity.

Cabinet okays Rs 4k cr third launchpad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-okays-rs-4k-cr-third-launchpad/articleshow/117312793.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro said Thursday it received the green light for the construction of a third launch pad (TLP) at its Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, from the Union Cabinet led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The project, estimated to cost Rs 3,984.8 crore, is set to enhance India's space launch capabilities and support future human spaceflight missions.The new facility is designed with versatility in mind, capable of supporting both Next Generation Launch Vehicles (NGLV) and LVM3 vehicles with semicryogenic stages.This strategic expansion comes as India sets its sights on ambitious space goals, including establishing its own space station by 2035 and achieving a crewed lunar landing by 2040.""The TLP will be developed with maximum industry participation, leveraging Isro's extensive experience from previous launch pad establishments,"" a govt statement read. The project is scheduled for completion within 48 months.TOI first reported about the TLP in October 2024. In an exclusive interview with TOI, then Isro chairman S Somanath said: ""We only have the second launch pad now. The first one was created for PSLV, but it can't be used for GSLV as it cannot handle the cryogenic stage. When LVM-3 came, we re-engineered the second launch pad. Now, LVM-3 will also have a semi-cryo stage, and the human spaceflight initially has to happen there.""Pointing out that the second launch pad has been undergoing several improvements in the past two decades, Somanath said in case something happens to the second launch pad - an explosion, for instance - there won't be a launch pad available for GSLV, and every programme will come to a standstill.""The primary objective of the third launch pad is to serve as a redundancy. Next is that we are moving to a new philosophy with the NGLV (New Generation Launch Vehicle); it is going to be integrated horizontally and tilted, not vertically. The launch pad must support this aspect. NGLV will be more liquid engine booster-based than solid engine, so the entire launch pad jet deflector design will change. Also, the entire stage testing will happen here and not at Mahendragiri. The launch pad will cater to all of this,"" Somanath said.","The third launch pad will be built at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.

Isro's SpaDeX op success stepping stone for India’s ambitious space missions: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isros-spadex-op-success-stepping-stone-for-indias-ambitious-space-missions-pm-modi/articleshow/117312695.cms,"NEW DELHI: The successful docking of two Isro spacecraft in space on Thursday has paved the way for future space and outer space missions as India desperately needs a permanent station in space for parking its spacecraft before pursuing a long space journey.The docking mission is a very challenging task as it involves reducing the inter-spacecraft distance between two fast-moving satellites till they unite.Though Chaser and Target satellites have been moving at a speed of 28,800 kmph or 10 times the speed of a bullet in space, they appear to be stationary due to zero relative velocity. Chaser then approached Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5 km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking.Only three countries — the US, Russia and China — have mastered this technology until now. India has now entered this elite club, becoming the fourth country to achieve this remarkable feat.Isro scientists started work on the space docking experiment (SpaDeX) in 2016 with preliminary studies and hastened the work on the technology when PM Narendra Modi in 2023 had set deadlines for the indigenous space station by 2035 and manned mission to the Moon by 2040. On Thursday, the scientists were overjoyed when Chaser and Target, both weighing 220kg, docked in space after initial hiccups.Lauding Isro scientists, the PM said the SpaDeX mission is a “significant stepping stone for India’s ambitious space missions in the years to come”.“Congratulations to our scientists at @isro and the entire space fraternity for the successful demonstration of space docking of satellites,” he said on X. President Droupadi Murmu also congratulated Isro for the mission.Space minister Jitendra Singh underscored that SpaDeX establishes India as a global leader in space docking technology. He also highlighted a significant collaboration between the Department of Biotechnology and Isro to explore the application of biology in space.Singh also highlighted the significance of the indigenous ‘ Bharatiya Docking System ’ used for the docking experiment and emphasised that this milestone paved way for smooth conduct of ambitious future missions, including Bharatiya Antriksha Station, Chandrayaan-4 and Gaganyaan .”PM Sh@narendramodi’s continuous patronage keeps the spirits soaring...,” he posted on X.Isro veteran Nambi Narayanan said, “It is something we all have been dreaming of for years. In every future mission, we will need to do docking for outer space missions. We have to perfect it. We have to be a master of the technology. It appears that we have become one since we achieved it gradually.” Former Isro scientist and Chandrayaan-1 project director Mylswamy Annadurai said besides playing a vital role in future missions, the docking technology could play a crucial role in managing space debris.The primary objective of the SpaDeX mission is to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for rendezvous docking and undocking of two small spacecraft in a low-earth circular orbit. The objectives also include demonstration of the transfer of electric power between the docked spacecraft, which is essential for future applications such as in-space robotics, composite spacecraft control and payload operations after undocking.The Indian industry is also upbeat about the mission’s success. “It truly opens doors to many possibilities, from furtherance of our space programs to establishment of our own space station in future. It also brings endless opportunities much closer, especially when our private space industry is moving forward and growing rapidly,” says Lt Gen AK Bhatt, director general, Indian Space Association (ISpA).",The successful docking of two Isro spacecraft in space on Thursday has paved the way for future space and outer space missions. India desperately needs a permanent station in space for parking its spacecraft before pursuing a long space journey. The docking mission is a very challenging task as it involves reducing the inter-spacecraft distance between two fast-moving satellites.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117312694,imgsize-1377252,width-400,resizemode-4/117312694.jpg"

"'God's own country' is shrinking as surging sea, erosion sink shores",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gods-own-country-is-shrinking-as-surging-sea-erosion-sink-shores/articleshow/117277878.cms,"Erosion threatens livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3m across 9 Kerala coastal dists

Paradise to peril

Coastal crisis deepens

Beachcombing was synonymous with Sujith's childhood in the sun-kissed shores of Shankumugham in Thiruvananthapuram. The beach was a magnet for family gatherings for shindigs on a sprawling stretch of ochre sand. The Indian Coffee House was an added bonus.The lapping of waves against Kerala 's sandy shores once promised timeless beauty, often the backdrop of postcards and a favoured retreat for travellers.Fast forward to 2025, and the state's idyllic beaches are under siege, with Shankumugham shrinking to a mere patch in 30 years since Sujith's playtime days.Today, these shores tell a tale of relentless erosion, rising sea levels, the ravages of sand mining, and communities struggling to hold onto their seafront homes. Over 55% of Kerala's 590km coastline is now ""vulnerable to erosion"".Two major studies in recent years, one by the National Centre for Coastal Research and another by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), have painted a stark picture of Kerala's coastal future.According to INCOIS, more than 300km of the state's coastline fall into high and medium vulnerability categories, with some areas experiencing erosion at rates as high as six metres a year. This rapid erosion threatens not only the natural landscape but the livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3 million people spread across nine coastal districts.In regions like Kannur, Kochi, Alappuzha, and Kasaragod, the encroaching sea is a daily reminder of vulnerability. Beaches in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Malappuram, and parts of Thrissur have already vanished or are in the process of disappearing.This accelerating loss is exacerbated by the warming Arabian Sea, which has led to an increase in cyclonic events and sea surges, particularly from May to Aug, with a peak in June and July.The human cost of this environmental crisis is immense. Many coastal communities have been displaced, their homes swallowed by the sea, leaving behind a trail of economic and emotional distress.For as long as anyone can remember, fishing communities along Alappuzha's coast have lived by the saying ""Kadalamma chatikkilla"" - the sea mother won't deceive. But as the shoreline erodes, that ancient faith is faltering. Sand mining, the silent thief, has stripped the beaches, forcing many to abandon their ancestral homes. Over 600 houses have crumbled into the sea's maw, and poverty grips the fisherfolk tighter each day.""I know no life but fishing,"" said Kalesh, a fisherman from near Thottappally harbour, watching the sea that once nurtured his community now gnaw at it. His parents live next door in a house built after the 2004 tsunami swept away their old one, but even this home bears the scars of erosion.""The catch has dwindled,"" Kalesh's mother Sura said. ""And there's no beach left to haul our boat ashore."" Their blue boat rests awkwardly in their yard, a silent testament to the changing tides.K C Sreekumar from Alappad recalled a time when the coastal stretch from Azheekkal to Vellanathuruth spanned 89sq km in 1955. By 2004, it had shrunk to a mere 7sq km. The once-thriving Alappad market, where small ships anchored, is now a shadow of its former self, as the sea continues its relentless advance.Many families have been forced to relocate, some never returning to their original homes. Others, constrained by financial limitations or fear of starting anew elsewhere, have chosen to stay, clinging to what remains of their lives along the coast.Businesses dependent on tourism are struggling to stay afloat. Aneesh, who runs Jeevan Beach Resort in Kovalam, said: ""Earlier, the beach had a width of 30m. Now, it is only 10m and hasn't been restored fully for the past two years. It affected the inflow of tourists, especially foreigners. Now, they come and check out the very next day. Earlier, they used to stay here for three months. Kovalam has lost its glory.""The waves have ""swallowed the walkway"" and tourists are vanishing, leaving local business owners like Senthil K, Jose Franklyn and Biju to struggle with plummeting sales. ""My sales have dropped by 70%,"" souvenir shop owner Senthil said. The once ""vibrant spot"" is now deserted, prompting desperate calls for urgent govt action to ""save the beach and our businesses"".Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) recently highlighted the scale of the crisis. From 2012 to 2021, the state experienced 223 sea surge events, with Alappuzha facing the highest number at 105, followed by Ernakulam (64) and Thrissur (54).Central Kerala, the hub of marine trade and tourism, is particularly vulnerable, experiencing an average of 12 hazard events for every 10km. Areas such as Eriyad, Azhikode, Chellanam, Ambalappuzha, Purakkad, Kuzhupilly, and Vadanapilly are now categorised as high-hazard zones due to a combination of sea surge inundation, sea-level rise, and severe erosion.""South and central Kerala are more susceptible because of their sandy coasts, unlike the rocky shores in the north,"" said Girish Gopinath, head of climate variability and aquatic ecosystems at KUFOS.The primary reasons cited for these changes are inadequate scientific planning of coastal infrastructure and the effects of climate change.More than 50% of Kerala's coastline is lined with artificial structures such as groynes, various types of seawalls and fishing harbours, in addition to ports. Groynes typically consist of wooden or concrete barriers, built perpendicular to a shoreline to prevent erosion, trap sand, and protect beaches from the impact of waves and tides.However, such structures have proved counter-productive, particularly in the south, where sediments are often washed away by littoral currents that flow parallel to a shoreline. According to Gopinath, this structural interference with natural sediment flows has intensified erosion, leaving areas like Cherthala and Ponnani exposed to the sea's relentless encroachment.""There is a phenomenon where seawater overtops into the shore, bringing with it large amounts of sediment. Unfortunately, due to choked and encroached canals, there is no way for the water and mud to flow back, exacerbating the problem,"" he said.Kerala University geology professor E Shaji pointed to the acute shortage of sediment supply from rivers, exacerbated by dredging, sand mining and sediment trapping by dams, as a major contributor to the problem. ""It would take at least five years to revive a beach,"" he said.As Kerala battles against nature and neglect, experts agree that an aggressive coastal management plan is critical. Without swift and coordinated action, the state's once-pristine beaches could be lost to history.Senior scientist K K Ramachandran emphasised the need for precise and up-to-date data to guide coastal development and conservation, ensuring that interventions are based on accurate tracking of erosion and accretion. ""Only a handful of projects use the latest data. We require a year's worth of data before proceeding with building any structures,"" said consultant at National Centre for Earth Science Studies.(Inputs from M K Sunil Kumar, T C Sreemol, Jaikrishnan Nair, Krishnachand K)","Erosion threatens livelihoods and homes of more than 9.3m across 9 Kerala coastal dists.

NEW DELHI: Three weeks before Delhi votes, Modi government announced on Thursday the setting up of the eighth pay commission , a move that will benefit not only 1.1 crore central govt employees and pensioners, including defence personnel, but also those working in the NCT administration and other states and UTs.The decision, which had been pending for several months, is also expected to buoy sentiments amid sagging consumption demand, with the award to be implemented from 2026.""We are all proud of the efforts of all govt employees, who work to build a Viksit Bharat. The Cabinet's decision on pay commission will improve quality of life and give a boost to consumption,"" PM Modi posted on X hours after I&B minister Ashwani Vaishnaw announced getting the green light from him.Modi opted to announce the new panel on the eve of the polls in Delhi, which has around four lakh govt employees. In 2014, Manmohan Singh had announced the seventh pay commission at the end of Feb, weeks before general elections were announced.The seventh pay commission saw additional expenditure of Rs 1 lakh crore during 2016-17. Effective July, the Centre is offering a dearness allowance of 53% of the basic pay or pension.While the last panel had recommended a fitment factor of 2.57 times - increasing the salary in pay band 1 from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 a month, this time govt is looking at the possibility of a further hike, sources indicated. In 2008, around the time of the global financial crisis, the UPA had opted for a fitment factor of 1.86 against the recommended 1.74, arguing that it would provide a fillip to consumption.However, it is still early days given that Thursday's announcement will be followed by the constitution of the pay panel, which is typically headed by a retired Supreme Court judge with retired secretaries and economists as members.The implementation of the panel's award is typically backed by an increase in demand for white goods, automobiles and real estate, and govt employees use the arrears and higher monthly income to indulge in purchases they often delay.For Delhi assembly polls, especially in constituencies in central and south Delhi, govt employees are a crucial vote bank. Just a few months ago, the Centre had also tweaked the National Pension System, which requires every employee who joined from 2004 to contribute, to guarantee a pension of 50% of the last pay drawn. The Centre will make good any shortfall in case the market return is lower and has also decided to provide for inflation adjustment for those who opt for what is now called the Unified Pension Scheme from April.","The decision had been pending for several months.

Supreme Court to study 'major' question on age in child marriage law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-study-major-question-on-age-in-child-marriage-law/articleshow/117309785.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prohibition of Child Marriage Act does not make a child marriage void but prescribes that any minor spouse can seek annulment of marriage within two years of becoming major. Under the law, a minor girl or any of her well-wishers, if they so choose, can challenge her marriage up to the age of 20. She is considered to be a major and marriageable after turning 18.But a serious problem arises in the case of a male minor because of the discrepancy between the ages when he is deemed to turn a major; that is 18, and when he is legally eligible to marry, that is 21. Supreme Court has decided to examine the issue and issued notice on a plea filed by a woman against an Allahabad HC order which had held that the age of becoming major for males under the Act was 21 years and annulled her marriage on her husband's plea who was around 23 years of age at the time.Section 3 of the Act says every child marriage shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of marriage and a petition may be filed at any time but before the child filing the petition completes two years of attaining majority.A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Ahsanuddin Amanullah agreed to hear the woman's plea and issued notice to her spouse. In her plea, the woman contended that the HC committed an error in annulling the marriage which was solemnised in 2004 when she was nine years old and her husband was 12.""Interpretation and application of Section 3 of the PCM Act as rendered by the HC in its judgment extends the limitation period for filing a suit to void a child marriage up to the age of 23 for a male. This is in direct conflict with the legislative purpose, constitutional principles and the protective ethos of the PCM Act,"" she said in her petition filed through advocate Saurabh Ajay Gupta.In this case, the marriage was solemnised by their parents and the husband became major (18 years) in 2010 and she in 2013. The husband thereafter filed a divorce petition in 2013. Four years later, he invoked Section 3 of the Act for annulment of marriage and amended the suit. But his plea was dismissed on the ground that he had first filed a divorce plea which meant that he implicitly confirmed and ratified the validity of the child marriage. The husband then moved the HC in 2018 and in Oct last year, the court allowed his plea for annulment of marriage. While the marriage was declared void, the HC ordered payment of permanent alimony of Rs 25 lakh to the wife.""The respondent, having attained majority on Aug 7, 2010, filed the annulment petition on July 5, 2013, well beyond the limitation period prescribed under PCM Act. The HC failed to appreciate the distinction between the age of legal capacity to marry and the age of legal capacity to institute legal proceedings,"" the woman said in her petition.","Prohibition of Child Marriage Act does not make a child marriage void but prescribes that any minor spouse can seek annulment of marriage within two years of becoming major.

Motivated bid to undermine secularism: Congress' plea to shield places of worship law

NEW DELHI: Congress has moved Supreme Court in support of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, saying the law was ""essential to safeguard secularism in India "" which is a basic feature of the Constitution and was needed to ensure communal harmony .Seeking to intervene in the litigation initiated by Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay , now with BJP, former MP Subramanian Swamy and other Hindu organisations who challenged the validity of the 1991 law, Congress sought outright dismissal of their petitions.Relying on the apex court's earlier verdicts, including its Ayodhya judgment, it said the court has on multiple occasions held that the focus of the nation must be towards the future and not at attempting to rectify atrocities of the past.""...The present challenge appears to be a motivated and malicious attempt to undermine established principles of secularism. The applicant seeks to intervene in this matter to emphasise the constitutional and societal significance of the POW Act , as it apprehends that any alterations to it could jeopardise India's communal harmony and secular fabric, thereby threatening the sovereignty and integrity of the nation,"" Congress said in its plea.The application, filed through advocate Abishek Jebaraj, said the petitions against the Act appeared to have been filed with oblique and questionable motives. ""The applicant seeks to oppose the present challenge to Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Act, on the grounds that the POW Act plays a pivotal role in furthering the right to freedom of religion and protects secularism, which is an established basic feature of the Constitution. The instant petition challenges a legislation that both in form and substance safeguards fundamental rights and the basic features of the Constitution of India, including but not limited to secularism and fraternity,"" it said.The law's validity has been challenged on multiple grounds, including that it is discriminatory and violative of fundamental rights and the petitioners have sought that Sections 3 and 4 of the Act be declared void and unconstitutional for being violative of Articles 14, 15, 21, 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution in so far as it seeks to validate 'places of worship' illegally made by ""barbaric invaders"".Section 3 of the Act puts a bar on conversion of places of worship and Section 4 prohibits courts from entertaining appeals and challenges to the religious character of certain places of worship and says the religious character of a place of worship as existing on Aug 15, 1947, shall continue to be the same.Countering the petitioner, Congress said their contention was patently flawed and POW Act was not in contravention of any fundamental rights .","Congress has moved Supreme Court in support of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act.

Ruidas, a resident of Garbeta in West Midnapore, had breathed her last on Jan 10 - a month since the stop-manufacture order had been issued.The bench was hearing two PILs that sought court intervention on the issue, claiming that the death was directly due to the use of the suspect saline solution. The lawyer for one of the petitioners, Phiroze Edulji, told the court that the company was banned for three years by another state govt last March, and that Bengal govt had been informed about this. The Siliguri regional office of Directorate of Drugs Control, a govt arm, had sent out the stop-manufacture order to the pharma company on Dec 10.Advocate general Kishore Datta informed the bench that the remaining stock had been withdrawn. The company's lawyer also said that they had stopped manufacturing the particular solution after the suspension notice was issued.The CJ said the health department should have frozen all stocks of the medicine the moment the order had been issued. The AG replied that the difficulty was over how to replace 30,000 units, which were already sent to state facilities, overnight.The court noted that action was taken by the Directorate of Health Service, Central Medical Store, on Jan 14, 2025 - by which a direction, banning all drugs manufactured by the company, had been issued to all medical colleges and hospitals. The CJ said both PILs had flagged the important issue of safety and health of Bengal's citizens, particularly those who use govt-run medical hospitals.The bench directed the chief secretary to file a report on the incident.

NEW DELHI: In a season of making annual declarations on investments and deduction, the income tax department has put employees and employers on notice after it came across lakhs of instances of individuals making bogus claims related to donations to political parties and charitable organisations as well as false investment and interest payment claims.It all goes back to searches and surveys conducted by the tax department in the last few years, which showed individuals claiming deductions for donations to unrecognised political parties that enjoy certain tax exemptions.Authorities found several instances of money being returned to the donors. In a large number of cases, it was found that actual donations were not made.""For political donations, there is no third-party verification, and individuals have been taking a chance, expecting they would not be caught. We have seen instances of employees of some companies indulging in fraudulent claims like these, there are thousands of such cases ,"" said a tax officer.A deeper analysis revealed that there were instances of bogus donations even to charities with some individuals claiming interest payment on loans for higher education when no loan had even been taken. There have also been cases where PAN numbers of individuals have been shared to claim tax free house rent allowance when no property has even been taken on rent.From investments (section 80C of the I-T Act) to health insurance premiums (section 80D), education loans (80E), specified charities (80G), political parties and electoral trusts (80GGB and 80 GGC) violations were observed, prompting a standard operating procedure being developed by the investigation wing to develop a standard operating procedure and approach employees and employers and individuals to revise their tax returns, or face action.Till Dec 2024, around 90,000 taxpayers have withdrawn incorrect deduction claims, which add up to Rs 1,070 crores, and have also paid additional taxes.Officials said the actual cases are nearly three times higher than the number of returns that have been updated and a drive is being launched to focus on employers to educate their employees, especially when there are certain clusters of companies where such violations are more rampant.","Till Dec 2024, around 90,000 taxpayers have withdrawn incorrect deduction claims, which add up to Rs 1,070 crores.

NEW DELHI: Observing that absence of adequate washroom facilities in court premises undermines equality and poses a barrier to the fair administration of justice, Supreme Court has directed states and all high courts to ensure the construction of separate toilet facilities for males, females, transgender and persons with disability in all court premises and tribunals across the country.A bench of J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan directed HCs to form a committee headed by its judge and comprising the chief secretary, the PWD secretary and the finance secretary of the state, a representative of the Bar Association to undertake the task.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

ISRO achieves milestone with successful satellite docking

From a shocking stabbing attack on Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan in his Mumbai residence to US President Joe Biden's farewell address to the nation, the news cycle remained eventful on Thursday. Hindenburg Research, the US-based investment research firm that made headlines with its explosive reports on companies like Adani Group and Block Inc., announced its unexpected closure.While on the geopolitical front, Israel and Hamas reached a significant milestone with their phase one ceasefire agreement after 15 months of devastating conflict.This and more. Here's everything that happened overnight.Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed multiple times in an attempted burglary at his flat in Bandra (West) on Thursday. The 54-year-old was attacked by an intruder who entered his 11th-floor apartment between 2 am and 2:30 am. Khan, who was woken up by a noise, had a scuffle with the assailant. During the altercation, the intruder fled after stabbing the actor six times, including a deep wound near his spine. The actor's family, including his son Ibrahim, rushed him to Lilavati Hospital, where he was undergoing surgery to treat the injuries, which also included damage to his left wrist.

Tom Brady experienced a breakdown following allegations of cheating in an NFL scandal that resulted in significant rule changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-experienced-a-breakdown-following-allegations-of-cheating-in-an-nfl-scandal-that-resulted-in-significant-rule-changes/articleshow/117284280.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Tom Brady was accused of cheating in an NFL scandal

Tom Brady 's first season as lead color commentator for Fox Sports was heavily criticized as sounding too robotic and having a bad cadence. There are those clamoring for Greg Olsen to get back into his old role of being Fox's No.1 commentator, but that won't happen since Fox paid Brady an enormous sum of money for the job.Even with his hefty salary, Brady has invested in the Las Vegas Raiders as a part-owner, which makes him less able to speak on other franchises.However, according to recent reports, Brady is also personally recruiting Detroit Lions OC Ben Johnson to be the Raiders' next head coach, meaning he is not toeing the line between his two jobs.Tom Brady, although very calm and collected on the field, once let his emotions out in the locker room, especially when he was accused of cheating. In 2015, Brady was accused of ordering the deliberate deflation of footballs used in the New England Patriots' 2014 AFC Championship Game victory against the Indianapolis Colts.Despite his protest of innocence, scandal led to his suspension from four games into the 2016 NFL season as well as fines of a $1 million fee for the Patriots and a couple of lost draft picks. The NFL believed Brady was aware of the scheme, but a documentary reveals his emotional state during a team meeting, describing him as an 'emotional wreck', highlighting the severity of the accusations against him.""When Deflategate happened and Tom was the headliner of the whole situation, he addressed us as a team,” Hall of Famer Darrelle Revis said, during an episode of the Apple TV+ series The Dynasty that aired last year. “You could tell he was distraught… He said this is something I wouldn’t do. I would not ruin the season for us; the allegations are false. He was actually bawling his eyes out in front of us.”Deflategate led to the change of some rules in the NFL, which included increased preparation of footballs for each game, random testing, and change in ball oversight. The properties of the football were not changed, and they were supposed to be inflated between 12 1/2 and 13 1/2 pounds per square inch (PSI). This emotional impact on New England's star and the NFL's rules remained unchanged.The NFL rules mandate each team to provide 24 footballs to officials' locker rooms two hours and 30 minutes before a game. Prior to 2015, home teams had to submit 24 footballs, while visitors had to submit 12. An additional 12 were available for outdoor stadiums. The referee designates two crew members to conduct pregame inspections to ensure all footballs meet specifications.Also Read: Tom Brady’s Luxury Car Obsession Started Humble with Sister’s Hand-Me-Down Ride In 2015, the officials started ball numbering and measuring PSI of each numbered ball. Balls falling within the allowed range of 12.5 to 13.5 PSI are accepted. Those above 13.5 or below 12.5 PSI will be deflated to 12.5 PSI or inflated to 13.0 PSI. Even air pressure spot-checks may be done at halftime of the games. However, quarterback Tom Brady, accused of cheating through Deflategate, has since shut it up with jokes.","Tom Brady's first season as lead color commentator for Fox Sports was heavily criticized as sounding too robotic and having a bad cadence.

Shedeur Sanders emerges as top draft prospect

The New York Giants have expressed considerable interest in quarterback Shedeur Sanders , especially in the lead-up to the 2024 NFL Draft. Reports suggest that the Giants had a finalized scouting dossier on Sanders prepared for the 2024 draft, viewing him as a potential pick in the second or third round. Sanders’ skill and the reality that this draft class isn’t as strong as last year’s loaded class make the Giants ‘ obsession with him understandable.Shedeur Sanders, who played at Jackson State before transferring to Colorado, has been a standout quarterback, captivating scouts with his performances and versatility.His talent for reading defenses, making swift decisions, and executing plays under pressure has attracted considerable attention.Alongside his strong leadership and high football acumen, Sanders has emerged as a top prospect. Consequently, teams like the New York Giants have shown interest, with some considering him as a potential cornerstone for their future as a franchise quarterback. This growing buzz around Sanders has ignited debates over how early he could be selected in the draft.In a mailbag for SNY, NFL reporter Connor Hughes mentions that the franchise is probably more focused on Sanders than on the other quarterback projected to be taken near the top of April's draft, Miami's Cam Ward . In fact, New York would have likely considered Sanders on the second day of the 2024 draft, had he entered the draft a year ago.""The talk around league circles has been Sanders,” Hughes said. “It’s been that way since before the season ended. The Giants actually had a completed report on Sanders ready if he declared for last year’s draft. He would have been a target in the second or third round.”Shedeur Sanders, after a standout second season at Colorado, has boosted his draft stock significantly. He threw for over 4,100 yards, leading Colorado to a 9–4 record, and finished eighth in Heisman voting. Now, instead of being a day two pick, he's in the running for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.If he falls past the Titans and Browns, the New York Giants are expected to show strong interest in selecting him as their potential future franchise quarterback.

The Custodian Witness



The Role of Ilya Sutskever



What his mother says:



Blood Evidence: A wig covered in blood was found at the scene, raising suspicions of a staged crime.

Missing Surveillance Footage: Two key entrances to Balaji's apartment were not under surveillance.

The Custodian Witness Role: Balaji’s possession of damning documents may have been a motive for silencing him.

Role: Balaji’s possession of damning documents may have been a motive for silencing him. Ilya Sutskever’s Security Detail: The heightened security around Sutskever suggests a climate of fear within the AI community.

Questions of Industry Corruption: Balaji’s mother hinted at deeper misconduct, beyond copyright violations, potentially implicating major AI companies like OpenAI and its affiliates.

A Call for Answers



Mother of Likely Murdered OpenAI Whistleblower Reveals All, Calls for Investigation of Sam Altman

What Suchir Balaji told NYT:



Legal and Ethical Concerns Over Data Usage: Balaji raised doubts about the legality and ethics of OpenAI’s use of copyrighted internet data to train AI models like ChatGPT. He believed such practices could constitute copyright infringement .

. Impact on Original Content Creators: He argued that AI-generated content was undermining the commercial viability of original creators, potentially replacing authentic works and affecting livelihoods.

Immediate Threats Posed by AI: Balaji emphasized that AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, were already causing harm by displacing existing internet services and generating false or fabricated information, commonly referred to as ""hallucinations.""

Skepticism Towards 'Fair Use' Defense: He was skeptical of the ""fair use"" argument often used by AI companies to justify their data practices. Balaji believed that the outputs of generative AI models might not meet the criteria for fair use, raising serious legal concerns.

Advocacy for Regulation: Balaji called for regulatory intervention, arguing that the challenges posed by generative AI could only be addressed through updated laws to govern the rapidly evolving technology.

The mysterious death of Suchir Balaji , a former OpenAI whistleblower, has taken a sinister turn following explosive revelations from his mother during an interview with Tucker Carlson. Balaji, who had been vocal about alleged misconduct within the AI industry, was found dead under circumstances that have left more questions than answers.Balaji's mother expressed doubts about the official narrative surrounding her son's death.""If Suchir was so brave to go to the news media and be a witness, how does someone so courageous do a cowardly act?"" she asked, referring to the possibility of foul play in her son's death.Tucker Carlson highlighted suspicious evidence: ""There's blood all over the apartment and a piece of a wig covered in blood—it's not his wig. You don't need to be a detective to imagine that someone committing a murder might wear a wig."" Adding to the intrigue, two of the apartment’s entrances lacked surveillance cameras. ""Wow,"" Carlson remarked, signaling the gaps in the investigation.Balaji’s role as a ""Custodian Witness"" was brought to light by The New York Times just days before his death. According to his mother, he possessed critical documents implicating OpenAI and other AI companies in wrongdoing. She suggested that her son's testimony might have uncovered far more than copyright violations. ""We need the FBI to investigate thoroughly. Was there any criminal activity? Why would they silence him?"" she urged.Balaji's mother also pointed to the curious case of Ilya Sutskever , a prominent AI figure, who appeared at a conference shortly after Balaji’s death surrounded by armed security guards. ""He was so scared for his life,"" she claimed. ""We're seeing the mafia behind all these things.""The case has raised significant alarm about transparency and accountability in the AI sector. As the family demands a thorough investigation, the world watches closely to see whether the FBI will uncover the truth about Suchir Balaji's untimely death. For now, the questions linger: What did Suchir Balaji know? And who wanted him silenced?","The mysterious death of Suchir Balaji has taken a sinister turn following explosive revelations from his mother during an interview with Tucker Carlson.

What prompted Albanian PM Edi Rama to drop to one knee for Italy's Giorgia Meloni at Abu Dhabi Summit?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/albanian-pm-edi-rama-goes-down-on-one-knee-for-italys-giorgia-meloni-diplomacy-or-drama/articleshow/117304655.cms,"Rama went full Romeo, dropping to one knee and serenading Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

Il compleanno di Giorgia Meloni ad Abu Dhabi, il regalo di Edi Rama

At the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama managed to turn what could have been a routine political encounter into a moment straight out of a rom-com. In a move no one saw coming, Rama went full Romeo, dropping to one knee and serenading Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni with ""Tanti Auguri"" on her 48th birthday.If that wasn’t enough, he capped it off with a beautifully designed scarf—a nod to Italian craftsmanship, albeit with a twist. The scarf, it turns out, was crafted by an Italian designer who now calls Albania home. Talk about dolce vita diplomacy.The unexpected gesture was a hit, showcasing the unlikely camaraderie between the leaders of two nations that, despite differing politics, seem to get along like an odd-couple sitcom.Meloni, a hard-right nationalist leading the Brothers of Italy, and Rama, a Socialist with a penchant for flair, have found common ground before. Last year, they brokered a deal to house migrants from Italy in Albania, though legal tangles have kept the plan in limbo.But birthday theatrics aside, the summit wasn’t all fun and games. Rama and Meloni joined forces with the UAE to sign a billion-euro ($1 billion) deal to build a subsea interconnection for renewable energy across the Adriatic. This ambitious project promises to boost green energy infrastructure in the region, cutting carbon emissions while tying the nations together more tightly than ever.In true Rama style, the scarf wasn’t just a gift—it was a symbol. A whisper of shared history, a splash of diplomacy, and, perhaps, a hint that politics doesn’t always have to be so serious. As for Meloni, who managed to keep her cool during the serenade, she might just be rethinking what her next diplomatic birthday party should look like.","Edi Rama serenaded Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni with ""Tanti Auguri"" on her 48th birthday.

This policy ensures that players remain connected to the domestic cricket ecosystem, fostering talent development, maintaining match fitness, and strengthening the overall domestic structure. It also inspires emerging players by providing them opportunities to compete alongside top cricketers, ensuring continuity in talent progression. Any exceptions to this mandate will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances and will require formal notification and approval from the Chairman of the Selection Committee, ensuring fairness and transparency in the process.Players Traveling Separately with Families All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. Separate travel arrangements with families are discouraged to maintain discipline and team cohesion. Exceptions, if any, must be pre-approved by the Head Coach and Chairman of the Selection Committee.Excess Baggage Limit Players are required to adhere to the specified baggage limits shared with the team. Any excess baggage costs will need to be borne by the individual player. This policy helps streamline logistics and avoid unnecessary expenses.Players - 5 pieces (3 suitcases + 2 kit bags) OR upto 150 kgs.

This ensures that the focus remains on team operations and minimizes logistical challenges. – this has to be done away with.Sending Bags Separately to the Centre of Excellence Players must coordinate with team management regarding equipment and personal items being sent to the Centre of Excellence, Bengaluru. Any additional costs incurred due to separate arrangements will be the player’s responsibility.Leaving Practice Sessions Early All players are required to stay for the entire duration of scheduled practice sessions and travel together to and from the venue. This rule ensures commitment and fosters a strong work ethic within the team.Personal Shoots During Series/Tour Players are not permitted to engage in personal shoots or endorsements during an ongoing series or tour. This avoids distractions and ensures that the players’ focus remains on cricket and team responsibilities.Family Travel Policy The family travel policy ensures a balance between players’ personal well-being and team commitments:Players absent from India for more than 45 days during overseas tours can be joined by their partners and children (under 18) for one visit per series (format-wise) of up to a two-week period.The BCCI will cover shared accommodation with the player for the Visitors’ Period. All other expenses are to be borne by the player.Visits must be scheduled at a single time during dates agreed upon by the Coach, Captain, and GM Operations.Any deviation from this policy must be pre-approved by the Coach, Captain and GM Operations. Additional expenses outside the visitors’ period will not be covered by the BCCI.Participation in BCCI’s Official Shoots and Functions Players are required to be available for BCCI’s official shoots, promotional activities, and functions. These engagements are essential for maintaining the BCCI’s commitments to stakeholders and promoting the game effectively.Players Returning Home if Matches End Early Players are required to stay with the team until the scheduled end of the match series or tour, regardless of whether matches conclude earlier than planned. This ensures unity, fosters team bonding, and avoids disruption to team dynamics.3All players are expected to adhere strictly to the above guidelines. Any exceptions or deviations must be pre-approved by the Chairman of the Selection Committee and Head Coach. Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action as deemed appropriate by the BCCI.Additionally, the BCCI reserves the right to take disciplinary action against a player which may include (i) sanction against the concerned player from participating in all BCCI conducted tournaments including the Indian Premier League; and (ii) deduction from retainer amount / match fees under the BCCI Player contract. This measure ensures accountability and reinforces the importance of adhering to established policies and prioritising Indian cricket.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced strict new norms for players.

Kelce’s Bold Claim: “I’m the No. 1 Swiftie”



""Is it all right for us to call you a Swiftie?""

""Yeah, I'm the No. 1 Swiftie.""

""No. 1, right? Even more than Mama?""

A Friendly Rivalry with Mama Swift



“I’m right there. We’re neck and neck. We’re tied at the top.”

The Swift’s and Kelce’s Bond



The Swiftie Showdown Continues



Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has embraced his status as one of Taylor Swift’s biggest fans—and he’s not shy about it. In a recent interview, Kelce jokingly crowned himself Taylor’s "" No. 1 Swiftie ,"" though he admitted that he isn’t the only one who stands in line to claim this title. Standing in his way is none other than Taylor’s mom, Andrea Swift , who since day 1 has been the biggest Taylor Swift supporter, through thick and thin.During his appearance on ESPN with Stephen A. Smith, Kelce was not hesitant when asked about his Swiftie status. When the question was presented to him by Smith,Kelce responded confidently by saying,His enthusiasm then prompted a challenge from Smith. He said,referring to Taylor's mother, Andrea Swift.Laughing off the question, Kelce responded,It’s a tall order to compete with Andrea Swift, who has been Taylor’s biggest cheerleader since her early career.Andrea has been there for Taylor, from her country music beginnings to her current global superstardom. But that hasn't stopped Kelce from making his case for the coveted title, especially since he's now a fixture in Taylor's orbit.Taylor and Travis’s mother also share a friendly bond. Interestingly, Andrea Swift is also a Kelce fan. She has attended several Kansas City Chiefs games and has been photographed sitting next to Kelce's mom, Donna. The two mothers have been seen cheering on Travis together, so the competition between Travis Kelce and Andrea for ""Top Swiftie"" is all in good fun.While Travis Kelce might be jokingly trying to take the title of Taylor's No. 1 fan, it's clear he's got tough competition in Andrea Swift. The friendly banter adds another layer of charm to Kelce's high-profile romance with Taylor, and fans are loving every moment. Whether or not he can truly surpass Mama Swift's dedication remains to be seen—but it's clear Kelce is having a blast trying.

Ashwini Vaishnaw fact-checks Meta CEO

Here’s the post shared by Ashwini Vaishnaw

Zuckerberg’s claim is factually incorrect: Ashwini Vaishnaw

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's recent claim that most incumbent governments, including the BJP-led NDA, lost power post-Covid-19 has led India’s Parliamentary Committee to summon Meta authorities. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey announced on X (formerly Twitter) that he would send a summon to Meta and demand an apology from the platform to India’s Parliament.He shared a post on X which, roughly translated into English, says: ""My committee will call Meta for this wrong information.Wrong information in any democratic country tarnishes the image of the country. That organization will have to apologize to the Indian Parliament and the people here for this mistake.IT and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared his disappointment over a recent statement by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about India's 2024 elections. During a latest episode of Joe Rogan's podcast, Zuckerberg mentioned that ""incumbents lost every single election in 2024,"" Specifically naming India. He linked this trend to a global loss of trust in governments after the Covid-19 pandemic. Zuckerberg further explained that public trust declined because of issues like inflation, pandemic-related economic policies, and how governments handled Covid-19. He believed this dissatisfaction led to incumbents losing elections worldwide.In response, union minister Vaishnaw took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation, specifically regarding India’s elections. He wrote “As the world’s largest democracy, India conducted the 2024 elections with over 640 million voters. People of India reaffirmed their trust in NDA led by PM @narendramodi Ji’s leadership.”He further added “Mr. Zuckerberg’s claim that most incumbent governments, including India in 2024 elections, lost post-COVID is factually incorrect. From free food for 800 million, 2.2 billion free vaccines, and aid to nations worldwide during COVID, to leading India as the fastest-growing major economy, PM Modi’s decisive 3rd-term victory is a testament to good governance and public trust.”Tagging Meta in the post, Vaishnaw stated “it’s disappointing to see misinformation from Mr. Zuckerberg himself. Let’s uphold facts and credibility.”","IT and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared his disappointment over a recent statement by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about India's 2024 elections.
