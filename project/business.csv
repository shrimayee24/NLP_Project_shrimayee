"'Misplaced concerns': India slams UN Human Rights chief's remark on Kashmir, Manipur",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/misplaced-concerns-india-slams-un-human-rights-chiefs-remark-on-kashmir-manipur/articleshow/118695977.cms,"Arindam Bagchi (File photo/X)

NEW DELHI: India on Monday lashed out at the United Nations' human rights chief for making ""unfounded and baseless"" comments about Kashmir and Manipur.Slamming the UN's human rights body for having a ""misplaced concern,"" India took strong exception to generalised remarks that were ""cherry picking"" of the situation.Arindam Bagchi, Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations, said India ""continues to be a healthy, vibrant and pluralistic society"".""As India was mentioned by name, let me begin by emphasising that the world's largest democracy continues to be a healthy, vibrant and pluralistic society. Unfounded and baseless comments in the update contrast jarringly with ground realities,"" said Bagchi, who is also the International Organisations in Geneva Ambassador.India's strong retort came after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, in his global update to the 58th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, mentioned India and referred to the situation in Manipur and Kashmir.According to news agency PTI, Bagchi said the people of India have ""repeatedly proven wrong such misplaced concerns about us"" and ""we would urge a better understanding of India and our civilizational ethos of diversity and openness, which continue to define our robust and often cacophonous civic space.""Bagchi said nothing illustrates this divergence more than the passing reference to Jammu and Kashmir, which Turk ""erroneously referred to as Kashmir"" in the global update.The Indian envoy further highlighted the irony of the UN human rights chief’s remarks, pointing out that this year had been particularly notable for the region's strides toward peace and inclusive progress. He cited key developments such as high voter participation in provincial elections, a thriving tourism industry, and a rapid pace of development.Pointing out the need for an authentic reassessment, Bagchi criticised the global update for its ""oversimplifications of complex issues, sweeping and generalised remarks, usage of loose terminologies and apparent cherry picking of situations.""He further remarked, ""The High Commissioner has sensed a pervasive unease, but we would submit that a key element to addressing this is a long and hard look in the mirror by the Office of the High Commissioner.""The UN human rights chief, in his global update, called for increased efforts to tackle violence and displacement in Manipur. ""I also call for stepped-up efforts to address violence and displacement in Manipur, based on dialogue, peacebuilding and human rights,"" he stated.Additionally, he expressed concerns about the use of restrictive laws against human rights defenders and independent journalists, which, he noted, has led to arbitrary detentions and a shrinking civic space, ""including in Kashmir.""Turk acknowledged India's democratic framework as a fundamental strength, stating, ""India's democracy and institutions have been its greatest strength, underpinning its diversity and development. Democracy requires constant nurturing of participation and inclusion at all levels of society.""His global update addressed conflicts and human rights issues in various regions, including Ukraine, Gaza, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the United States. However, Pakistan was notably absent from the report.","India slams UN's human rights body for having a ""misplaced concern"" India took strong exception to generalised remarks that were ""cherry picking"" of the situation.

"Shahzadi Khan execution: On death row in UAE, UP woman's last wish was to 'speak to her ammi & abbu'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shahzadi-khan-execution-on-death-row-in-uae-up-womans-last-wish-was-to-speak-to-her-ammi-abbu/articleshow/118692594.cms,"Shahzadi Khan

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars."" But what of the deeper scars - the ones left behind?","Shahzadi Khan was convicted of murdering a four-month-old child in Abu Dhabi.

Kilambakkam Terminal to Replace Tambaram for Mofussil Buses Starting Tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mofussil-buses-to-terminate-at-kilambakkam-from-tomorrow/articleshow/118666282.cms,"Chennai: Starting Tuesday, all govt mofussil buses from the southern districts will terminate at Kalaignar Centenary Bus Terminus (KCBT) in Kilambakkam instead of Tambaram, following a directive aimed at easing congestion on Grand Southern Trunk Road.While the govt has promised to deploy 100 additional MTC buses to improve connectivity between KCBT and key transit hubs in Chennai, passengers remain unconvinced, citing the inconsistency of MTC services. At present, the govt claims to operate 590 buses from KCBT.""We often wait 15 to 20 minutes for a bus in the early hours when returning to Chennai after holidays, only to find overcrowded MTC buses. Those who can't afford to wait are forced to pay higher fares for autos or taxis to reach Tambaram,"" said B Ganesh, a resident-activist from Varadharajapuram. He also criticized the decision to reroute buses to Kilambakkam before completing the Kilambakkam railway station and pedestrian pathway connecting it to the terminus. The govt earlier promised to open the railway station by May.The decision to divert mofussil buses to Kilambakkam is based on recommendations from Tambaram police to decongest GST Road.At present, TNSTC buses halt in front of Tambaram railway station, blocking one or two lanes of the three-lane road, causing daily bottlenecks. The problem is worsened by autos encroaching on the left-most lanes. On the opposite side, govt buses are often forced to stop in the middle of the road to drop passengers, despite a designated bus bay.By shifting mofussil bus operations to Kilambakkam, police expect smoother movement of MTC buses and local vehicles through the area, where traffic delays of 10 to 15 minutes have become routine.","Starting Tuesday, all govt mofussil buses from southern districts will terminate at Kilambakkam instead of Tambaram.

NEW DELHI: A couple arrested by ED from Punjab on Friday, who had masterminded a multi-level marketing fraud by duping investors with promises of handsome rental value on purchase of cloud space & leasing it back, has been remanded in ED custody.On Saturday, a special PMLA court in Jalandhar remanded Sukhvinder Singh Kharour to 10 days and Dimple Kharour to five days in ED custody. They allegedly collected over Rs 3,500 crore in past 2-3 years and siphoned off the ""proceeds of crime"".Look out notices were issued after they went underground. At least 26 luxury cars worth Rs 80 crore (belonging to the couple) were seized by ED last month. ED also attached other assets in Punjab, totalling Rs 178 crore.""The cloud sale and lease back model was found non-existent to cheat the investors. The proceeds of crime of Rs 3,558 crore (ascertained so far) generated out of criminal activities were diverted by VMSL (Vuenow Marketing Services Ltd) and group companies in giving commission to channel partners, purchase of various luxurious vehicles, gold and diamonds, routing of hundreds of crores through shell entities and further investment in properties,"" ED said.The accused created multiple shell entities to siphon off proceeds of crime. Huge funds were also diverted into bank accounts of Dimple and to film production units controlled by her, such as Kharour Films LLP, Fruitchaat Entertainment Pvt and Avni ITInfra Ventures Ltd, in which she is a director. However, these companies do not have any relation with the cloud particle business VMSL that collected huge funds from investors, the agency said.ED was on the lookout for the influential couple who had evaded arrest in Punjab for a long time despite several complaints of cheating and fraud. The central agency finally registered an FIR in Noida and with the help of UP Police issued a look out notice. Officials coordinated with international enforcement agencies that helped in tracing the accused in Nepal from where they were sent to India. ""Sukhvinder, CEO and founder of Vuenow Group is 'mastermind' of the scam who in connivance with his close aides orchestrated the 'Cloud Particle Scam',"" ED said.","Sukhvinder and Dimple Kharour masterminded multi-level marketing fraud.

Legal battle and mercy pleas

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Monday said United Arab Emirates (UAE) officially informed the Indian Embassy on February 28 that ""the sentence of Shahzadi has been carried out in accordance with local laws.""The ministry added that the UAE's highest judicial authority, the Court of Cassation, upheld the death sentence, and all legal appeals and mercy petitions failed to overturn the ruling.Earlier today, MEA told the Delhi high court that Indian national, Shahzadi Khan , was executed in (UAE) on February 15, 2025, after being convicted of murdering an infant under her care.""An Indian national, Shahzadi, was convicted on charges of murder of an infant and sentenced to death in the UAE. The highest court of the UAE, the Court of Cassation, upheld the sentence. The Embassy provided all possible legal assistance to Shahzadi, including sending mercy petitions and pardon requests to the government of the UAE. The UAE authorities intimated to the Embassy on February 28, 2025 that the sentence of Shahzadi has been carried out in accordance with local laws. The family of Shahzadi has been informed of the matter,"" MEA said later in the day.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, representing the MEA, informed the Delhi high court about Shahzadi's execution. He also said that the Indian government was providing support to her family, and her cremation is scheduled for March 5.The heartbroken father, Shabbir said that his daughter was not given justice. ""She was not given justice. I tried my best. I have been trying since last year. I don't have enough money to go there (Abu Dhabi) and hire a lawyer. Government did not support us,"" he said.Shabbir Khan had approached the Delhi high court, urging the MEA to intervene in his daughter's case and seek clarity on her legal status. However, with confirmation of her execution, the court disposed of his plea.Shahzadi, a 33-year-old woman from Banda district in Uttar Pradesh, had been working in Abu Dhabi since December 2021 as a caregiver for an Emirati family. The case stemmed from the death of an infant under her care in December 2022, allegedly following routine vaccinations. Initially, the child's parents waived further investigation, but in February 2023, a video surfaced allegedly showing Shahzadi confessing to the murder, a confession her family claimed was obtained through coercion.She was arrested on February 10, 2023, and sentenced to death on July 31, 2023. Her appeals were dismissed, and the death sentence was reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation on February 28, 2024.Shahzadi's family contested the conviction, alleging that she was forced into confessing and denied fair representation. Despite legal assistance provided by the Indian Embassy, her clemency plea faced significant hurdles. Her father, Shabbir Khan, submitted multiple petitions, including one to the Indian Embassy in May 2024, but received no favourable response.On February 14, 2025, Shahzadi reportedly made a distress call to her father, hinting at her imminent execution. Desperate, Shabbir filed an urgent plea with the MEA on February 20, seeking an update on her legal status. However, before any intervention could be secured, the execution was carried out.MEA officials assured that they are extending all necessary assistance to the family, and Shahzadi's last rites are set for March 5. The Indian Embassy has also provided a dedicated contact number for the family to coordinate further arrangements.","Shahzadi Khan, 33, was convicted of murdering an infant under her care.

Israel presses India for a ban on Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-presses-india-for-a-ban-on-hamas/articleshow/118692235.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid its ongoing effort to clear out the Gaza Strip of Hamas, Israel continues to press India for the group's designation as a terrorist organisation. The immediate provocation on this occasion for seeking its listing as a terror group is the presence of several Hamas leaders in POK last month on "" Kashmir Solidarity Day "".This was possibly the first time that Hamas leaders, who were joined by members of UN proscribed terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), travelled to POK. Israel is learnt to have discussed this with the Indian authorities. Despite its unqualified support for Israel on terrorism, and strong condemnation of the October 7 2023 terror attacks on Israel, India has not banned Hamas, even as many countries, including the US and EU, have designated it as a terrorist organisation.In 2023, Israel had banned Pakistan-based LeT, which carried out the Mumbai attacks. Israel's then ambassador to India Naor Gilon had expressed hope India too would proscribe Hamas, saying information about the group's terrorist activities had been shared with Indian govt.Whether or not there's a proposal to ban Hamas is a question that has also been raised in Indian Parliament, but external affairs ministry has responded so by only saying that designation of an organisation as terrorist is covered under UAPA and is considered as per provisions of the Act by relevant govt departments.In a fine balancing act, India, while backing Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, has continued to maintain its ties with Palestinian people, reiterating support for a negotiated two-state solution, and establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognised borders, living side by side in peace with Israel. India also supports Palestine's membership of the UN.","Israel is learnt to have discussed this with the Indian authorities.

NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed on Monday got caught up in a controversy following her remarks wherein she allegedly fat shamed India's men's cricket captain Rohit Sharma.In a social media post on X, the Congress leader described the Indian captain as ""fat"" and a ""mediocre captain"".“Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!” she wrote in a now-deleted post.Later, Mohamed justified her statement and said that the tweet was not body-shaming and she has the right to give her opinion in a democracy.""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that. I have been attacked for no reason,"" she said.""When I compared him with previous captains, I put in a statement. I have the right. What is wrong in saying? It is a democracy,"" she added.Shama hails from Kunnur in Kerala. She was appointed as spokesperson for the Congress in July 2015.According to Shama's LinkedIn profile, she is also a dentist and has worked as a journalist before joining politics.She completed her primary education from an Indian school in Kuwait and graduated as Bachelor of Dental Surgeon from Yenepoya Dental College in Mangaluru.In December 2018, she was given the role of national media panellist for the party.Meanwhile, Congress pulled Shama over her remarks and asked her to delete her social media posts and exercise greater caution in the future.“Dr. Shama Mohammed, National Spokesperson of the Indian National Congress, made certain remarks about a cricketing legend that do not reflect the party's position. She has been asked to delete the concerned social media posts from X and has been advised to exercise greater caution in the future,” Khera said.He also added that the party holds sporting icons in the highest regard and does not endorse any statements undermining their legacy.Congress MP Rajani Patil said that the Congress will seek a response from Mohamed on the issue. ""I personally and the party also will not approve of body shaming anyone. Talking this way about a sportsperson who represents the country is not right.

'Have babies immediately': Stalin amid delimitation row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-babies-immediately-stalin-amid-delimitation-row/articleshow/118692438.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin

TRICHY: Tamil Nadu 's crusade against delimitation took ""baby steps"" towards a full-blown public showdown with the Centre on Monday, with CM M K Stalin calling on newlyweds to ""immediately"" have children for the state to have an upper hand when the exercise is rolled out in over a year.The CM was speaking at a wedding ceremony in Nagapattinam, suggesting that the state's successful population control has now turned out to be a disadvantage. ""With policies such as delimitation that Union govt is planning to implement, we cannot say that (population control is a success). So I would now urge newlyweds to immediately have babies and give them good Tamil names,"" Stalin said.This comes as the governing DMK and the CM have accused the BJP-led Centre of hatching a conspiracy to reduce constituencies in TN under the garb of delimitation. ""It is a danger aimed at reducing our representation and crushing our voice,"" Stalin said at a political event later.Stalin had previously described the proposed delimitation as a ""sword"" hanging over southern states. Congress-governed Karnataka and Telangana have extended support to Stalin on the issue.The CM urged parties, boycotting a March 5 all-party meeting, to set aside political differences and speak in a unified voice against delimitation as well as the Centre's three-language policy under the New Education Policy. The appeal came as BJP , NTK, and TMC opted out of the meeting. ""We (DMK) have invited all parties. Many have agreed to participate, but some are planning to skip. I urge them once again to reconsider and join,"" Stalin said.The CM accused the Centre of imposing the three-language policy and deliberately withholding funds. ""Even children in TN understand this conspiracy. Recently, a girl from Cuddalore donated Rs 10,000, saying, 'If the Union government won't provide funds, I will.' This reflects the prevailing sentiment in the state, which the BJP-NDA fails to grasp,"" Stalin said.","Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin calls on newlyweds to ""immediately"" have children for the state to have an upper hand when the exercise is rolled out in over a year.

Prevalence of excess weight among Indians up nearly five-fold in 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prevalence-of-excess-weight-among-indians-up-nearly-five-fold-in-30-years/articleshow/118692424.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Prevalence of excess weight among people in India has gone up nearly five times in the past 30 years - from approximately 53 million in 1990 to 236 million in 2021, claims a new study published in The Lancet.If action is not taken to curb this growing public health challenge, the study warns, the overweight and obesity prevalence in the country may go up to over 521 million (projected) - the second highest globally, by 2050. China, which was estimated to have approximately 464 million overweight or obese persons in 2021, is likely to have the highest number of persons with the lifestyle disorder at 696 million (projected) in the next 30 years, the study suggests.The study is based on an analysis of 1,350 unique data sources, including all major multi-country and national survey data. For individuals older than 18 years, overweight has been defined as having a BMI of 25 kg/m² to less than 30 kg/m² and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher. For individuals younger than 18 years, the definitions were based on the International Obesity Task Force criteria.Importantly, the authors note that more recent generations are gaining weight faster than previous ones and obesity is occurring earlier, increasing the risk of complications such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and multiple cancers occurring at younger ages.For example, in high-income countries, approximately 7% of men born in the 1960s were living with obesity at the age of 25, but this increased to around 16% for men born in the 1990s and is forecast to reach 25% for men born in 2015.The authors have called for a five-year action plan (2025-30) to curb the rise in obesity globally and help form new goals and targets for the post-2030 Sustainable Development Goal-era. ""Preventing obesity must be at the forefront of policies in low- and middle-income countries,"" said co-lead author Dr Jessica Kerr.""Policy action in these regions must balance the challenges of over-nutrition with under-nutrition and stunting, with interventions ranging from support for nutritional diets and regulating ultra-processed foods to promoting maternal and child health programmes that encourage pregnant women to follow a healthy diet and breastfeed. This is no time for business as usual. Many countries only have a short window of opportunity to stop much greater numbers shifting from overweight to obesity,"" she said.Kerr stressed on the need to transform diets within sustainable global food systems and to support comprehensive strategies that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it is too much processed food or not enough parks.Recently, PM Narendra Modi raised the issue of growing incidence of obesity in the country and suggests ways, including reduction of intake of cooking oil in all households, to curb the problem.","China is likely to have the highest number of persons with the lifestyle disorder at 696 million in the next 30 years.

AHMEDABAD: A 19-year-old UP native living incognito in Faridabad and suspected of preparing for an attack on Ram temple in Ayodhya was arrested in a joint operation Sunday, soon after Gujarat police's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) got wind of the alleged ISI-engineered plot and teamed up with Haryana's Special Task Force (STF) to bust the alleged terror network.The arrest of Abdul Rehman Abu Bakar , who had been lying low in Faridabad under the assumed identity of Shankar, led investigators to a suspected accomplice and a hideout where they found two hand grenades provided by ISI handlers through a network linked to the Islamic State of Khorasan Province.A bomb disposal squad safely defused the explosives in Faridabad, ATS sources said. Rehman is from Milkipur near Faizabad, on the southern bank of Saryu, about 6.5km from Ayodhya. He had been living in Faridabad and working part-time as an autorickshaw driver and an employee at a local family-run eatery.Rehman had been allegedly assigned the task of reconnaissance of sensitive locations, including Ram temple and administrative offices in UP. A pen drive seized during the raid was found to contain what investigators said was ""incriminating material"", including blueprints of the proposed attack, potential targets and instructions from his handlers. Investigators suspect the attack was to happen ""very soon"".Top ATS officials were summoned to Delhi for a security briefing soon after the arrests. Sources in home department said central intelligence agencies have started working with state forces to dismantle any sleeper cells linked to this plot.

NEW DELHI: An Indian woman on death row in Abu Dhabi for the alleged murder of a four-month-old infant was executed on February 15, the Centre informed Shahzadi Khan’s horrified family in Delhi high court on Monday.Indian embassy was informed about execution only on Feb 28. “It is over. She was executed on Feb 15. Her last rites will be held on March 5,” a senior law officer representing Centre told Justice Sachin Datta.HC was hearing the woman’s father’s plea seeking the MEA’s intervention to find out about her well-being. “It is very unfortunate,” the court said, even as additional SG Chetan Sharma assured the court that embassy officials & the petitioner were in touch and arrangements were being made so the family could attend daughter’s last rites in UAE.We did our best to save Shahzadi. We hired a law firm there to represent her in court. But the laws there treat the death of an infant severely, additional SG Chetan Sharma said. MEA said Shahzadi Khan, 33, was convicted and sentenced to death for murder of an infant and Indian embassy was informed about the execution only on Feb 28. Govt sources had said on Feb 17 that a review petition had been filed and the matter was still under a consideration.“The embassy provided all possible legal assistance to Shahzadi, including sending mercy petitions and pardon requests to the govt of UAE. UAE authorities intimated the embassy on Feb 28 that the sentence of Shahzadi has been carried out in accordance with local laws. Family of Shahzadi has been informed of the matter,” the ministry said, adding the highest court of UAE, the court of Cassation, had upheld the sentence.Her father, Shabbir Khan, a resident of UP’s Banda, had approached court saying there was “profound uncertainty” over his daughter’s situation and his repeated applications to MEA for clarification were fruitless.The father’s plea claimed that Shahzadi was inadequately represented before the local courts and she was pressured into confessing, leading to imposition of death penalty. The father alleged that the infant’s parents had refused consent for a postmortem and also signed an agreement to waive further investigation into the death, but still his daughter was arraigned & held guilty.","Indian embassy was informed about execution only on Feb 28.

"Need norms, not censorship: SC to government in Allahbadia case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-norms-not-censorship-sc-to-government-in-allahbadia-case/articleshow/118692098.cms,"NEW DELHI: SC on Monday ruled out censorship of freedom of speech and said it remained sacrosanct if it conformed to reasonable restrictions.However, it clarified that this was not a licence to broadcast on social media platforms filthy words and depraved thoughts that militate against decency and morality. Expanding the scope of the petition of influencer Ranveer Allahbadia seeking protection from arrest for crass comments on a show, SC told the Centre to consider framing guidelines, after carrying out consultations with stakeholders, to regulate the content of shows and podcasts on social media.But these guidelines, whether framed judicially or by Parliament, should not be in the shape of censorship. Framers of our Constitution had the foresight of giving wide latitude to free speech and yet, at the same time, had exemplary wisdom to circumscribe it through reasonable restrictions enumerated in Article 19 (2). The guidelines should not lead to censorship. But to say it is a free for all is also very dangerous,” a bench of Justice Surya Kant and N K Singh said.The Supreme Court had on Feb 18 given Allahbadia a dressing down before staying his arrest in FIRs lodged in Thane and Guwahati.The court allowed Allahbadia to hold his shows on the condition that he would not violate traditional Indian norms on decency and morality.“There should be some element of control so that free speech is not misused but the regulations cannot impinge on freedom of speech,” the bench said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the govt was all for it.“Government is also against any censorship of free speech. But in the name of comedy, one cannot broadcast something which is indecent, vulgar and perverse. Freedom of speech is precious, it must be protected. But perversity cannot be freedom of speech. The young generation must be protected from such shows,” Mehta said.Allahbadia’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud pleaded with the court to stay the arrest and relax its Feb 18 condition — not to hold any show till further orders — and said 280 people worked with Allahbadia and their livelihood would be jeopardised if the petitioner was prevented from running his show.Taking into account the apology and remorse expressed by Allahbadia, the SC agreed to relax the condition but warned that he should not be seen violating traditional Indian societal norms on decency and morality in any of his shows. On his request to allow him to visit foreign countries, the bench said it would be considered after he cooperated with the investigations being carried out by police in Maharashtra and Assam.“We know one of your associates who went to Canada and made all kinds of comments on the court order,” the bench said, inviting an immediate clarification from Chandrachud that his client had nothing to do with the show broadcast from Canada. He said the person concerned was a copanelist with Allahbadia in the controversial show and there was no other connection between the two. “Such was the vulgarity, obscenity and the rotten level of humour and language used by Allahbadia in the show that no family could have sat together and watched that kind of a show,” the SG said.On the warning of ‘adults only’ for the show, Mehta said a child could not be allowed access to such shows under the specious ruse that the producers had sounded the ‘adults only’ warning. “Our standards of morality and decency differ from the western world,” he added.“Government also is against censorship, but there should be some regulation on such use of profanity which militates against the morality and decency of society. There are comedians who are very critical of the govt yet make shows without crossing the limits. They employ good humour, which can be watched by one and all,” Mehta said.The bench told Mehta that the Union govt should discuss with all stakeholders to deliberate what safeguards and measures are needed to regulate free speech, but these must not amount to censorship.","Supreme Court ruled out censorship of freedom of speech and said it remained sacrosanct if it conformed to reasonable restrictions.

SC seeks government’s response on social media blocking rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-seeks-governments-response-on-social-media-blocking-rules/articleshow/118692085.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a PIL that challenged the constitutional validity of a provision of ‘ Blocking Rules, 2009 ’ on the ground that it violated the right of content creators to be heard by authorities, who preferred to direct social media platforms to block content.Appearing for PIL petitioner organisation ‘Software Freedom Law Centre’, senior advocate Indira Jaising told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran that under Rule 9 of Blocking Rules, authorities had the freedom to issue notice either to the content creator or the social media platform which hosted the content. Be it Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other social media platforms, authorities give blocking notices only to them to avoid giving reasons to the content creator for deciding to block certain posts, Jaising said.“The arbitrary use of Rule 9 as an emergency provision to block user content without any prior notification leaves the originator of the content no mechanism of relief due to the lack of a notice, a reasoned order, and an opportunity to be heard. These rights are intrinsic to freedom of speech and expression, and the right to receive information, which can be granted to the originator even as the blocking order is in effect,” she said. Though the bench said it would have been appropriate for any content creator who was aggrieved by non-issuance of notice to him/her prior to blocking of content to move court, it decided to issue notice to Centre and sought its response in six weeks.Jaising said the intermediary, which hosts the content, was under no obligation to seek aresponse or clarification from the content creator when authorities gave it notice for blocking certain content, thus leaving the content creator with no remedy to retrieve the content and repost it. “An intermediary is merely providing a platform for hosting information and has no means to understand or justify the originator’s defence against the blocking order, nor does the intermediary have a vested interest in defending the originator’s content. Such a process thus renders the blocking process inherently unfair and violative of the fundamental rights of the originator,” the petitioner said.","Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a PIL that challenged the constitutional validity of a provision of ‘ Blocking Rules, 2009 ’ The PIL claimed that authorities had the freedom to issue notice to the content creator or the social media platform which hosted the content.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692086,imgsize-303064,width-400,resizemode-4/118692086.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday questioned Gujarat police for lodging an FIR against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi over a social media post with a poem, ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno (those who are bloodthirsty listen to us)’.The piece is about promoting non-violence and is not related to any religion or antinational activity, the court said, noting that there is nothing objectionable about it. “Some sensitivity has to be shown by police. They should have read the poem before taking action”, SC said while disapproving of the FIR. “In 75 years of the existence of the Constitution, freedom of speech and expression has to be at least now understood by police,” it said.At the outset of the hearing on the politician’s plea for quashing of the FIR, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan read out the English translation of the poem, which said, ‘Those who are blood thirsty listen to us. Even if the fight for justice is met with injustice, we will meet that injustice with love’.“This (poem) actually promotes non-violence. It has nothing to do with religion, this has nothing to do with any anti-national activity. Police have shown lack of sensitivity,” SC said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, said people took Pratapgarhi's social media posts in different ways which created the problem. The bench responded, “This is the problem. Now, nobody has any respect for creativity.” At this stage, senior senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Congress MP, intervened and said the apex court should also say something about Gujarat High Court which approved lodging of the FIR. However, this was strongly opposed by Mehta who said the court should not venture in that area.Though the court hinted in no uncertain terms that criminal proceedings against the MP were not required, it reserved its order. “Something needs to be said” in the case which would be reflected in the judgment, it said.The SC had earlier granted interim relief to Pratapgarhi by stopping all steps in pursuance of the FIR. The FIR was registered over an Instagram post featuring a video clip with the poem ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno’ running in the background.The FIR was registered by City A-Division police station, Jamnagar, against him for hurting religious sentiments and promoting enmity between different groups Pratapgarhi had first approached Gujarat HC for quashing of criminal proceedings but the HC on Jan 17 refused to quash the FIR, saying there was a need for further investigation. It had said the poem's tenor indicated something about the throne and that responses to the social media post also suggested a potential disturbance in social harmony.“Looking to the tenor of the poem, it certainly indicates something about the throne. The responses received to the said post by other persons also indicate that message was posted in a manner which certainly create disturbance in social harmony. It is expected from any citizen of India that he should behave in a manner where communal harmony or social harmony should not be disturbed and the petitioner, who is a Member of Parliament, is expected to behave in a more restricted manner as he is expected to know more about the repercussions of such a post,” the HC had said.Immediately after the Gujarat HC order, Pratapgarhi rushed to the apex court which on Jan 21 granted him protection. Noting that he had not been arrested in the case so far, SC had said “no further steps shall be taken in any manner on the basis of the FIR”.","The piece is about promoting non-violence and is not related to any religion or antinational activity, the court said. “Some sensitivity has to be shown by police.

Govt panel chalks out 'glide path' for IAF's capability enhancement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-unveils-glide-path-to-expedite-capability-enhancement/articleshow/118691736.cms,"Defence minister Rajnath Singh with the report

NEW DELHI: A detailed roadmap for the “all-round accelerated capability enhancement” of the Indian Air Force has been chalked out by a high-powered committee to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner, with greater participation from the private sector to complement the ongoing efforts of the DRDO and defence PSUs.The “key thrust areas” identified in the report range from progressively increasing the number of fighter squadrons, which is currently down to just 30 despite a sanctioned strength of 42.5, to induction of additional “force-enablers” like airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft and mid-air refuelers as well as a wide array of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, who chaired the committee, presented the report to defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday evening, in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh, vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar and others.It comes at a time when China is now flaunting even 6th-generation fighter prototypes, and is expected to deliver at least 40 J-35A stealth 5th-generation jets to Pakistan. India, in sharp contrast, is floundering to even produce the home-grown 4th-generation Tejas jet in adequate numbers, which has led the IAF chief to publicly lash out at Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) repeatedly. Noting that IAF is “very badly off in numbers”, ACM Singh on Friday said his force needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.“The committee has made recommendations for implementation of the key thrust areas in the short, medium and long-term so as to achieve the IAF’s desired capability enhancement goals in an optimal manner. The basic aim is to hasten the capability-building process in terms of R&D, production rates and the like,” an official said.Parallelly, a defence secretary-led committee has also been constituted to examine how the planned indigenous 5th-generation fighter called advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA) can be fast-tracked.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the development of the swing-role AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore, but it will be ready for production only by 2035 as of now.The report presented on Monday has detailed a “glide path” to increasing the number of fighter squadrons, which includes a foreign OEM (original equipment manufacturer) tying up with an Indian partner to set up a production line here.“While HAL’s three production lines for the light-weight Tejas will continue, this will be a parallel production line for a different medium-weight fighter,” another official said. This involves the long-pending project to manufacture 114 new 4.5-generation fighters, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration.The report underscores “the need for impetus to enhance ‘Aatmanirbharta’ in the aerospace domain with the private sector complementing the effort of defence PSUs and DRDO”.“The defence minister directed that the recommendations be followed up in a time-bound manner. The committee was formed on his directions to holistically examine all issues and prepare a clear plan of action,” the official said.","A high-powered committee has chalked out a detailed roadmap for the “all-round accelerated capability enhancement’ of the Indian Air Force. The “key thrust areas” identified in the report range from progressively increasing the number of fighter squadrons, to induction of additional “force-enablers” like airborne early-warning and control aircraft.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118695467,imgsize-1311365,width-400,resizemode-4/118695467.jpg"

JAMMU: Amid his perceived closeness with central government despite his party, National Conference, being part of opposition INDIA bloc, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday clarified there are no plans for an alliance with BJP as they had different political visions.“We both have different ideologies. Our thoughts also do not align... If we talk about J&K, our approach is vastly different,” Omar told reporters outside the assembly before the start of the budget session. The CM has repeatedly maintained that having cordial ties with the Centre should not be construed as political alignment with BJP.He also asserted that there was no need to bring a fresh resolution condemning the abrogation of Article 370, as the J&K Assembly had already passed one in its first sitting last year, and the Centre had not rejected it.Speaking in the assembly, Omar showered lavish praise on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , saying India and Pakistan were very close to resolving the Kashmir issue during his tenure. “I don’t think I will ever see it happening again in my lifetime,” he added.He said Singh carried forward the legacy of his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee by keeping the dialogue process alive. “He could have stopped the process of dialogue, but continued shouldering it as a huge responsibility,” the CM said while speaking on obituary references in the House. Singh and former Pakistan president General Pervez Musharraf had made significant progress in talks, he said.Referring to the deteriorating situation in J&K in 2010, Omar said Singh set up working groups to heal the wounds of the people. A similar exercise was needed at present, too, he added.On Kashmiri Pandits, the CM said Manmohan Singh settled the community at the biggest Jagti Township colony in Jammu, and also reserved jobs for them. He also lauded Singh’s contributions to India’s economic growth and key welfare initiatives.Earlier, LG Manoj Sinha, in his address to the assembly, reaffirmed the Omar govt’s commitment to continue its efforts towards restoration of statehood.“One of the foremost aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is the restoration of full statehood. My govt remains steadfast in its commitment to addressing this legitimate desire of the citizens,” he said.Stating that the govt “recognises the emotional and political significance of statehood for the people”, he said it is actively engaging with all stakeholders to facilitate this process “in a manner that ensures peace, stability and progress”.“This budget carries historic significance as it is the first in over seven years to be presented by an elected govt in J&K,” Sinha further said, adding: “This budget is not merely a financial document; it is a testament to the aspirations of the masses, reflecting their hopes for a brighter future.”Unlike past years, when the budget address by the then governors of the erstwhile state of J&K were often disrupted by members, there was just a lone incident of walkout out by an Independent MLA, Sheikh Khursheed Ahmed, seeking justice for the families of two persons recently killed in Kathua and Sopore, and for restoration of statehood.","Omar Abdullah has repeatedly maintained that having cordial ties with the Centre should not be construed as political alignment with BJP. He also asserted that there was no need to bring a fresh resolution condemning the abrogation of Article 370, as the J&K Assembly had already passed one last year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118691308,imgsize-784207,width-400,resizemode-4/118691308.jpg"

The man who claimed to be Hussain was unmasked.

Delhi police arrested him on arrival. He faces multiple serious charges, including cheating by impersonation, and misuse of passport. What stunned Indian immigration officials was the Pakistani passport. Not just any forged document, but an actual lost passport that belonged to Hussain.Cornered, Patel confessed. He had paid an agent in Dubai to forge his identity, swapping his Gujarat roots for a Pakistani character, just to secure a spot on a flight to US.Patel's real passport had expired in 2016 and instead of renewing it, he relied on human traffickers who provided him with fraudulent documents and facilitated his illegal journey via Dubai.""Human smugglers pick passports that are strong for getting a US visa or randomly assign some UAE citizen's passport to sneak into US,"" a source said.","AC Patel, whose real passport had expired in 2016, was arrested on arrival in Delhi for misuse of passport and cheating by impersonation.

DEHRADUN: There was no time to run. One moment, the workers were asleep inside their container homes, the bitter cold pressing in from all sides, the hum of the mountains steady and unbroken.

And before anyone could move, the avalanche was there, like a sudden apparition in a horror movie.Ganesh Kumar, a road construction worker from Pithoragarh, barely had time to open his eyes before the container was ripped from its place it was pegged and sent tumbling into the snow.

""The snow was everywhere - pushing against us, pressing into our chests. We tried shouting, but the sound just died around us.

Footsteps. Voices, muffled through the snow. Hope surged through their bodies like a shock. ""At first, I thought I was imagining it,"" another worker said. ""Then the sound got closer, and suddenly, the snow started shifting."" Hands broke through the ice, pulling them from the wreckage, dragging them into the open air.

Taylor Swift urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate

Taylor Swift is reportedly coming under more pressure to keep her personal life separate from her professional image. Some, according to insiders, think that her very public romance with Travis Kelce might be having a detrimental impact on her reputation. The debate was heightened after she received boos at the Super Bowl—a moment that some waved off as friendly ribbing, while others interpreted it as a sign that her involvement in the NFL universe isn't welcomed by everyone.Taylor Swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate. Sources claim that certain advisers of hers are of the view that her celebrity romance with Travis Kelce might be damaging her carefully crafted persona.Disapproval mounted after she was booed at the Super Bowl, but others interpreted as definitive proof that her growing presence within the NFL community isn't for everyone. Since Swift is arguably one of the most powerful entities in the music industry, a few insiders fret that her visibility with the world of sports would bring unnecessary turmoil to her profession.At the same time, Travis Kelce is also receiving flak, especially from fans of the Kansas City Chiefs questioning if his priorities on football have been diluted. His disappointing outing in the last game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles only added fuel to the fire, with some of them positing that his life outside the football field, including his relationship with Swift, might be affecting his performance.Once regarded as an untouchable leader on the field, Kelce is now under scrutiny for possibly letting distractions interfere with his play.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce might be ready to welcome a new family member soon

Fans have been speculating for years about a Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce engagement, but now anticipation is brewing about whether they will have a family. Since they got together in 2023, the couple has been going strong despite the challenges of grueling careers and media attention. Even though many are waiting to hear a formal engagement announcement, new tarot readings predict that an even more significant milestone—a baby—is on the horizon.Since the beginning of 2025, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been surrounded by engagement rumors, with people guessing when the two would be taking the next huge step in their relationship. A new excitement is brewing now, though, as some feel that they might be getting ready for an even greater milestone—having a family.Their romance has taken center stage ever since rumors of their relationship emerged for the first time during the summer of 2023. Owing to their busy professions and the perils of living under the media's glare, Swift and Kelce have shown that they remain a solid and stable couple. Through emotional public outings to understated gestures signaling the strengthening of their relationship, they keep asserting their devotion to each other.While most fans are waiting with bated breath for an engagement update, recent tarot card predictions have thrown some spice into the pot that the couple's future may be even more life-altering—a baby. If the predictions prove to be true, Swift and Kelce may soon be starting the journey of parenthood, adding a new page to their already historic romance saga.Inbaal Honigman, a tarot card reader, suggests that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may be planning to expand their family soon. Honigman dismissed rumors of Swift being pregnant, but her reading strongly suggests a pregnancy in the near future. ""At the Grammys, Taylor posed on the red carpet head-on, with her arms by her side and, at times, her hand on her waist,"" Honigman explained. ""She wasn't trying to hide her tummy, nor glancing down towards her middle.""She also pointed to Taylor Swift's appearance at the Super Bowl, ""Her back is strong, supporting her powerful stance with no sign of fatigue or tenderness. The singer-songwriter's arms are placed wide, not protecting her tummy in any way.""Honigman's tarot reading indicates that despite no visible signs of pregnancy, a baby may be imminent. ""When asking the deck of cards whether Taylor and Travis are expecting, the answer is not right now, but very, very soon, possibly even this spring,"" she revealed.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift: Were They Together Longer Than Fans Thought?



Wes Bergmann, Uncaged | The Social Game Ep 4

For more than a year and a half, fans have been fascinated by the romance between Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and pop icon Taylor Swift . Their relationship has been chronicled in headlines, stadium appearances, and heartfelt interviews. However, a new revelation from Kelce’s neighbor suggests that their love story might have started much earlier than previously believed.Taylor Swift had openly admitted that she and Kelce began talking in July 2023, shortly after the NFL star expressed his admiration for her on his “New Heights” podcast. Kelce had attended one of Swift’s concerts with the intention of giving her a bracelet with his number on it, but the opportunity never arose. Months later, their relationship became public when Swift attended a Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium, marking the beginning of their highly publicized romance.However, MTV star Wes Bergmann, Kelce’s neighbor in the gated community of Leawood, Kansas, claims that the two had been dating for six months before their public debut. During his appearance on the “RHAP” podcast, Bergmann confidently stated, “I was like the first person to know about any of this stuff,” Bergmann said on the “RHAP” podcast. “And I tried to tell [podcast host Michelle Fitzgerald] a long time ago ‘they are together, just so you know’ and she didn't believe it. She didn't believe it, she was like ‘she only goes for artists.’ I beat the validating of her showing up to games and stuff by six months.”If true, this means Kelce and Swift were a couple much earlier in 2023, possibly overlapping with Swift’s brief romance with Matty Healy of The 1975, which ended in June of that year.While Bergmann’s claims add an intriguing layer to their love story, Swift herself has acknowledged that she and Kelce had more private time together before going public. In her December 2023 TIME magazine interview, she shared details about their early days: “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell. We started hanging out right after that.” She further elaborated, “So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”These statements align with Bergmann’s assertions, strengthening the possibility that their relationship had been blossoming long before Swift’s Arrowhead appearance. Interestingly, even Kelce’s own family was kept in the dark for a while. His sister-in-law Kylie Kelce confirmed on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast that Travis kept the relationship a secret from both her and Jason Kelce for some time before they finally found out. “We were not [told about his relationship with Swift at first],” Kylie revealed. “I will say we knew before everyone else knew, but it was not like [he told us right away]. … Jason and I found out together, but we knew before they hard-launched before going to a game.”As their relationship continues to thrive under intense media scrutiny, Kelce remains focused on his football career. Despite the Chiefs’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the star tight end confirmed last week that retirement is not on the horizon. He is expected to discuss his decision further in an upcoming episode of “New Heights.”Meanwhile, life off the field has had its challenges. Kelce’s $6 million home, located next to Bergmann’s residence, was burglarized last October, resulting in the loss of valuable memorabilia, cash, and watches. Following the incident, he has reportedly heightened security measures, installing advanced surveillance systems and acquiring two guard dogs to safeguard his residence.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce's beau Taylor Swift eyeing Hollywood again? Rumors swirl around her return in a sci-Fi thriller Whether Kelce and Swift’s romance began in July 2023 or earlier, one thing is certain—this love story has captured the hearts of fans worldwide.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
