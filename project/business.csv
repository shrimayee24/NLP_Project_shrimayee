Courts have bolstered India's reputation for arbitration: Justice Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-have-bolstered-indias-reputation-for-arbitration-justice-kohli/articleshow/112237411.cms,"NEW DELHI: The courts in the country have bolstered India's reputation as a favourable destination for arbitration by upholding the sanctity of arbitral awards, Supreme Court judge Justice Hima Kohli has said. She was speaking at a seminar 'Recent Developments in Arbitration to Promote Business' organised by law firms Gibson Dunn Secretariat and UNUM Law, along with the International Arbitration and Mediation Centre (IAMC) and General Counsels' Association of India on Friday.Justice Kohli said the growth of international trade made dispute resolution more complex and to address the challenges, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), especially arbitration, had emerged as a powerful tool for businesses.""In recent years, India has made significant strides in establishing itself as a reliable partner in arbitration and mediation services. India's transformation into a commercial arbitration hub has been driven by the judiciary's unstinting commitment to fast-tracking matters under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and fostering a broadly pro-enforcement regime,"" said Justice Kohli.The apex court judge said various landmark judgments showed that India is committed to upholding the sanctity of arbitral awards.""By limiting judicial intervention and respecting arbitral awards, the effort of the Indian courts has bolstered India's reputation as a favourable destination for (alternative) dispute resolution. This judicial philosophy complements legislative reforms and signifies India's ambition to become a global hub for arbitration,"" she said.Justice Kohli underlined the need to foster a specialised arbitration bar, comprising experts and legal practitioners solely engaged in arbitration, because of the upsurge of institutional arbitration in the country.She said seminars and training sessions would streamline every facet of the arbitration process, from the drafting stage to enforcement of the award, besides boosting confidence in the country as an arbitration hub.""This would also ensure that arbitration gains traction and does not take a back seat compared to litigation in court,"" said the top court judge.Justice Kohli underscored that the recent amendments in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act aligned the laws with the best international practices and promoted a pro-arbitration regime that inspired confidence in the resolution of commercial disputes.""In 2021, the Act underwent further amendments. The 2021 amendment to the arbitration process is aimed at addressing new challenges and improving its effectiveness. These changes are directed towards promoting institutional arbitration, recognising the importance of specialised arbitration institutions, ensuring confidentiality during the proceedings and impartiality in the appointment of arbitrators,"" she said.Regarding the entry of foreign law firms in India in specific areas and on a reciprocal basis, which was permitted by the Bar Council of India in March 2023, Justice Kohli said it would provide the young talent with opportunities to compete with peers in the Western countries, besides enabling Indian law firms to adopt global best practices.""Additionally, these regulations will help address concerns about the influx of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and establish India as a hub for international commercial arbitration,"" she said.Justice Kohli said the country had the potential to establish itself as a preferred choice for international arbitration, particularly for commercial businesses.""It has a progressive legislative framework, a pro-enforcement judiciary and robust institutional support. Through its verdicts and administrative initiatives, the Indian judiciary has consistently demonstrated its commitment to ensuring the finality of the arbitral awards, encouraging mediation and fostering a pro-investment environment,"" she said.""Undoubtedly, India stands as a reservoir of untapped potential, poised to ascend as a premier destination for commercial mediation on the international level,"" she added.","Supreme Court judge Justice Hima Kohli said the growth of international trade made dispute resolution more complex.

SC bins PILs seeking probe into poll bond quid pro quo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bins-pils-seeking-probe-into-poll-bond-quid-pro-quo/articleshow/112236782.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday dismissed PILs seeking a retired SC judge-led SIT probe into allegations of award of contracts to certain corporate entities and termination of probes against others after they donated huge sums to governing political parties through electoral bonds which were held as unconstitutional by the SC on February 15.Refusing to order a roving inquiry into assumptive allegations of petitioners through advocates Prashant Bhushan, Vijay Hansaria and Pranav Sachdeva, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said the petitions were founded on the assumption that there could be an element of quid pro quo given the EB donations' proximity to award of contracts and change of pace of investigations.""Individual grievances of this nature with regard to the presence or absence of quid pro quo would have to be pursued on the basis of the remedies available under law. Likewise, where there is refusal to investigate or a closure report has been filed (on complaints relating to alleged EB quid pro quo), recourse can be taken to appropriate remedies under the law governing criminal procedure, or as the case may be under Article 226 (before high courts),"" the bench said.Bhushan even alleged that some officers of premier investigating agencies were suspected to have been involved in this quid pro quo exercise to force corporate houses to donate to political parties through EBs. ""At the present stage, absent a recourse to the remedies available under the law to pursue such grievances, it would be premature for this court to entertain the PILs,"" the bench said. ""The intervention of SC must be preceded by invocation of normal remedies under the law and contexted upon failure of these remedies. It would also be inappropriate because intervention of this court at this stage would postulate that the normal remedies which are available under the law would not be efficacious,"" it added.The SC said it had entertained challenges to the validity of statutory provisions embodying the EB scheme and consequential amendments to diverse statutes (Representation of the People Act, Companies Act and Income tax Act) because the power of judicial review to test validity of these changes was within its domain.Distinguishing between criminal wrongdoing allegations and constitutional validity challenges, the bench said the former were of a distinct nature where recourse to the SC's jurisdiction under Article 32 should not be taken as a matter of course, particularly when remedies were available under law. ""Moreover, the other reliefs which are sought in this batch of petitions, including a direction to the authorities to make recoveries from political parties on the basis that they (EB donations) are proceeds of crime and for that matter, the reopening of income tax assessments (of political parties from 2018) impinge upon statutory functions of authorities constituted under law to make inquiry in that regard,"" the bench said.Full report on www.toi.in","Supreme Court dismisses PILs seeking a retired SC judge-led SIT probe into allegations of award of contracts to certain corporate entities.

PARIS: World Athletics (WA) president Sebastian Coe on Thursday lauded World and Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra for putting India in the elite company of 100 nations who have won a gold in athletics at the Olympic Games.""At Tokyo we had 22 member federations winning gold medals. And we now have 100 countries winning a gold medal in athletics.

I hope to extend that to all three medals at Los Angeles . It's the right thing to do. We are not the only one funding athletes; over 60% of NOCs have done that. I had conversations with many athletes from other sports. I think we made the right decision.""On the shoe technology taking the human element away more, Coe said: ""I think it's the evolution of technology. We talked to the athletes and coaches and we are not perfect with the regulations. We will continue to monitor that but if we get faster times at stadia we welcome that.""Coe, who won the 1500m gold in the Moscow Games in 1980 and Los Angeles four years later, said he was happy to see 1500m back in the spotlight.The WA president also said that it was a unanimous decision of the WA council to not allow athletes from Russia and Belarus. ""WA is not a political body and we made a tough decision on Russia and Belarus and that was done on the integrity of sport. There is a track and field team coming here and they have some very serious medal chances. It' a very constrained world that the athletes have to operate in.

Centre notifies 6th draft on Western Ghats eco zone as states refuse to play ball,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-notifies-6th-draft-on-western-ghats-eco-zone-as-states-refuse-to-play-ball/articleshow/112233057.cms,"Farming won’t be affected, says Western Ghats eco zone draft

NEW DELHI: Three days after the massive landslides in Kerala 's Wayanad district, Centre on Friday released a sixth draft notification proposing earmarking of 56,825 sq km as ecologically sensitive area (ESA) to prohibit/regulate environmentally hazardous human activities within the fragile Western Ghats , spread over six states.The draft for the first time has a provision enabling the final ESA notification to be taken up ""in a phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification"" - a move that may hasten the process without waiting for all six states to be on board at the same time.The states haven't been keen on the proposal.Within the proposed ESA is 9,993 sq km in Kerala, which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district, including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30.Earmarking of ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs) in Western Ghats, on which Centre issues a sixth draft on Friday, was pending since August 2011, when a central panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, recommended that the government take it up on priority to save the fragile terrain in six states.Environment ministry that notified the sixth draft in official gazette days after the Wayanad tragedy on Wednesday, said the proposal will be “taken into consideration” for publishing the final notification of ESA on or after expiry of a period of 60 days from the date on which copies of the gazette are made available to the public.The ministry sought “objections or suggestions” on the proposals in the draft. Except for provision of notification in a “phased manner”, the sixth draft broadly replicates the fifth one, issued in July 2022, whose validity expired on June 30.Accordingly, it proposed ESA of 20,668 sq km in Karnataka; 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra; 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu; 1,461 sq km in Goa and 449 sq km in Gujarat, and recommended prohibiting or regulating certain human activities in those areas.The draft proposed a complete ban on mining, quarrying, sand mining and high polluting industries. It said all existing mines will be phased out within five years from the date of issue of the final notification or on the expiry of existing mining lease (whichever is earlier).Besides, it also prohibited setting up of any new thermal power projects and expansion of existing power plants within the ESA. Construction of projects of 20,000 sq m and above; and all new and expansion of townships, and development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built up area of 1.5 lakh sq m and above will also be prohibited after the final notification.On the other hand, it proposed regulation of hydro-power projects, essential services and low-polluting industries. The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdictions in Western Ghats. The first draft notification to earmark ESA was issued in March, 2014, but the proposal remains on paper since then. In the meantime, the ministry issued 4 more drafts in 2015, 2017, 2018 & 2022.Centre and an expert panel discussed fifth draft with Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, nine times during July 2022-March 2024 but could not finalise ESA notification due to objections from states — initially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa, and later from Karnataka. The then Karnataka govt even requested Centre to withdraw the draft notification in 2022, arguing that ESA, covering 20,668 sq km of area within the state, would adversely affect livelihood of people.The draft clearly specifies that agriculture, plantation and less polluting activities will not be affected due to the ESA provisions and the actual area will be finalised based on the recommendation of the states.","The draft for the first time has a provision enabling the final ESA notification to be taken up ""in a phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification"" The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdictions in Western Ghats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112233128,imgsize-1544822,width-400,resizemode-4/112233128.jpg"

Review

aims to ensure law is working in practice

NEW DELHI: Stepping beyond constitutional courts ' traditional role limited to testing the constitutionality of legislations and validity of executive decisions and taking on oversight functions, Supreme Court has ruled that it can direct a performance audit of legislations to identify and address infirmities in their implementation on the ground.This ruling came from a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Arvind Kumar, who asked the Bombay HC chief justice to constitute a special bench for a performance audit of Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, which has, over the years, been in the eye of litigation in HC and even in SC.Justice Narasimha said, ""Assessment of the working of the statute to realise if its purpose and objective has been achieved or not is the implied duty of the executive government.""Justice P S Narasimha said, “Reviewing implementation… is an integral part of rule of law. It is in recognition of this obligation of the executive govt that constitutional courts have directed govts to carry out a performance audit...”The purpose of review is to ensure a law is working in practice as it was intended and if it’s not, then to understand why and address it quickly, bench said, while pointing to another reason for such performance audits.“A peculiar feature of how our legislative system works is that an overwhelming majority of legislations are introduced and carried through by govt, with few private member bills being introduced and debated. In such circumstances, judicial role does encompass, in this court’s understanding, the power, nay the duty, to direct the executive branch to review the working ofstatutes and audit the statutory impact,” the bench said.However, SC clarified that before a constitutional court orders performance audit of a legislation, it must assess the litigation history of the operation of the law to arrive at a finding that “statutory schemes and procedures (under that legislation) are gridlocked in bureaucratic or judicial quagmires that impede or delay statutory objectives”.“One can only state that this direction must be predicated on a finding that the statute has, through demonstrable judicial data or other cogent material, failed to ameliorate the conditions of the beneficiaries.”","Supreme Court has ruled that it can direct a performance audit of legislations.

It is well established that misleading the House by a Minister or a Member constitutes a breach of privilege and contempt of the House,"" the Congress MP wrote.""Under these circumstances, we submit that privilege proceedings may be initiated against the Union Home Minister in this matter,"" the letter read.Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, meanwhile, provided ""additional facts"" to both Houses of the Parliament on the Wayanad landslide incident with ""fact copies of India Meteorological Department's early alerts issued from July 23 to July 29"".The facts mentioned that such heavy rainfall, in hilly areas like Wayanad, could also lead to other rainfall-induced disasters, such as landslides.""As per the National Policy on Disaster Management, the primary responsibility for disaster management, adequate preparedness measures, rests with the State Governments concerned,"" mentioned the additional facts furnished in both the Houses of the Parliament.""In its daily heavy rainfall warning issued by IMD five days before the occurrence of the sad event, it predicted continuously the occurrence of heavy to very heavy rainfall over Kerala during 0830 IST of 29th to 0830 IST of 30th July 2024 based on 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th. On 29th midday IMD issued an Orange colour warning with prediction of heavy to very heavy rainfall (upto 20 cm) valid upto 0830 IST of 30th July. IMD issued impact based forecast in colour codes and suggested actions alongwith the heavy rainfall warning. The impact based forecast included possibility of landslide and localized inundation and damage to vulnerable structures,"" it said.Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday blamed the Kerala government for its delayed response to early warning systems regarding potential landslides in state, attributing the major losses to their lack of prompt action. Shah highlighted that on July 23, nine teams from the National Disaster Response Force were dispatched to Kerala following the early warning.""""An early warning was given to Kerala govt on July 23 and again on July 24. Earlier, several states, including Odisha and Gujarat used the Centre's early warning system to limit damages,"" he said in Rajya Sabha.""Under this early warning system, on July 23, at my direction, 9 NDRF teams were sent to Kerala considering that there could be landslides... What did the Kerala government do? Were the people shifted? And if they were shifted then how did they die?"" he asked.""Wayanad losses could have been minimised had Kerala govt become alert following arrival of NDRF teams,"" he said.Over 300 people have lost their lives in the deadly landslides as rescue operations continue.In response to Amit Shah's remark, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan hit out at Centre, saying it was not the time for blame game.Kerala CM further stated that the media provides accurate warnings and that weather notifications are always taken seriously in the state.""Media provides accurate warnings, and weather alerts are always taken seriously in the state. This is not the time for mutual accusations. The facts are clear to everyone. An orange alert was in place in the area where the disaster occurred. In the first 24 hours, 200 millimetres of rain fell. In the next 24 hours, 372 millimetres of rain fell. A total of 572 millimetres of rain was recorded over 48 hours exceeding the warning levels,"" the CM said.Vijayan also highlighted that no red alert was issued for the area prior to the disaster. ""A red alert was only issued at 6 am on the day of the disaster. The red alert was issued only after the landslide occurred. The severe weather warning and red alert were given on the morning of July 30, after the landslide. The Central Water Commission did not issue any flood warnings for the Punnappra River or Chaliyar River from July 23-29. This is the fact, the statements made in Parliament were factually incorrect,"" the Kerala chief minister said.","Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Friday moved a privilege motion against Union home minister Amit Shah for his ""gave prior warning to Kerala"" remark. The Centre, however, jumped in to defend the remark. Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai provided ""additional facts"" to both Houses of the Parliament on the Wayanad landslide incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112227038,imgsize-1160268,width-400,resizemode-4/112227038.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In the wake of Supreme Court recommending stricter procedures for verifying candidate identities for examinations, a recent case has come to light where an alert technical organisation under central govt averted a dozen possible impersonators from joining after they had been selected by a government recruitment agency .In some cases, major discrepancies were detected in their documents and in several cases photographs of the candidates in the files sent by the recruitment entity did not match with their actual physical appearance.Officials said the ""successful"" candidates were selected for appointment as multi-tasking staff (technical). ""When their credentials were checked, officials detected discrepancies, such as mismatch of handwriting . A committee was then set up to verify all details and their joining was put on hold till the process was complete,"" said a source.""Subsequently, when we sent communications to authenticate the credentials, none of them turned up. So, the process of joining couldn't be completed,"" added the source.As per sources, during first stage of verification , some of the candidates who were confronted with mismatch with photographs in the files came up with strange excuses of how they had long hair and gained weight just before the exam. Their claims were not convincing and there was a possibility that someone else appeared for the candidate in the test.The organisation has sent the dossiers of the candidates to the recruitment agency for necessary action.Talking to TOI, senior govt officials said proper checking of details and other credentials of candidates at the time of joining any organisation can prevent people coming to the system using unfair means. “Exam centres should have CCTV cameras & recruitment agencies must use good cameras (at least 6 MP) and click colour photographs for more clarity. Best way to prevent any such fraud is to go for biometric attendance at the time of exam so that their authenticity can be verified when they join any office,” an official said.","Officials said the ""successful"" candidates were selected for appointment as multi-tasking staff (technical) When credentials were checked, officials detected discrepancies, such as mismatch of handwriting.

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Friday brought closure to the controversy over NEET UG- 2024 by holding that there was no systemic failure in this year's exam for admission to medical colleges across the country and that the paper leak was limited to centres in Hazaribag and Patna. This brings finality to the results and ranks of the test.Besides, it expanded the remit of the Centre-appointed panel headed by Isro ex-chairman K Radhakrishnan to enable it to recommend measures to ensure security, sanctity and integrity of pan-India exams.It asked for the report be submitted by Sept 30. The SC criticised National Testing Agency for its laxity and flip-flops. ""By identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, such a panel will help restore trust in the exam system and implement robust safeguards,"" it said.Pronouncing a 63-page judgment detailing reasons for its refusal on July 23 to cancel NEET-UG, a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, “By identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, such a committee will help restore trust in the examination system and implement robust safeguards to prevent future malpractice.” It faulted NTA for failing to communicate in time to designated banks for release of a particular set of question papers, resulting in candidates getting a wrong set.“A body such as NTA, which is entrusted with immense responsibility in relation to highly important competitive exams, cannot afford to misstep, take an incorrect decision and amend it at a later stage. All decisions must be well considered, with due regard to the importance of the decision. Flip-flops are an anathema to fairness,” the CJI said.Though the bench spared 23.3 lakh students having to take NEET-UG afresh, as demanded by petitioners, it faulted NTA for failing to communicate in time to designated banks for release of a particular set of question papers, resulting in candidates getting a wrong set.The apex court also held NTA responsible for awarding full marks for two options to an atomic theory question when it was clear that only one of the options was correct, as was later reaffirmed by IIT-Delhi. Further, it criticised NTA’s decision to award grace marks resulting in over 60 candidates scoring perfect 720/720 marks.Authoring the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said the Radhakrishnan committee must evaluate and recommend reforms in the mechanism of administration of exams, which must include rigorous checks and balances at every stage, from setting question papers to declaring results. It extended the panel’s tenure from Aug 22 to Sept 30, by when it must submit its recommendations to education ministry.SC said the Dharmendra Pradhan-headed ministry shall take a decision on the committee’s recommendations within a month of receiving the report.The bench said the committee would also formulate SOPs which set out the timelines for registration, changes to preferred cities, sealing of OMR sheets once candidates submit them to the invigilator, and other processes related to conduct of the exam. “Once adopted by NTA, the SOPs must be adhered to, to maintain the integrity of the exam,” it said.","Supreme Court: No systemic failure in this year's exam for admission to medical colleges.

"1,500 estate workers stare at uncertainty as Manjolai estates return to woods",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1500-estate-workers-stare-at-uncertainty-as-manjolai-estates-return-to-woods/articleshow/112231416.cms,"Set deep in the dense woods of Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in Tirunelveli district, Manjolai is a breathtaking hill station. It is also home to 2,500 people, including estate workers, who have been living here for generations. But of late, this small community of estate workers have been losing sleep. The town, which comes under the reserve forest category, is about to be handed back to the government following the end of a 99-year lease on the land.This means all the workers will be deprived of a livelihood.The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd (BBTCL) leased 8,374 acres of land from the then Singampatti Zamindar on Feb 12, 1929. The land was developed to grow cash crops, including tea, coffee, cardamom and pepper for which labourers were brought from Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and neighbouring Kerala. Nestled in the scenic setting, Manjolai, Kakkachi, Nalumukku, Oothu and Kuthiraivetti are all wards in the BBTCL estate.As time went by, workers got houses, civil supplies shops, high schools, govt-aided elementary schools as well as hospital creches and a guesthouse, which belonged to the factory. Temples, churches and mosques were also constructed, besides a biodiversity museum and a conservation centre for lion-tailed macaques.On Feb 28, 2018, the first bombshell dropped, with Tamil Nadu govt declaring the 23,000 acres of land, including the 8,374 acres of the Manjolai estate, as reserve forest. With the courts striking down the BBTCL’s request to grant pattas for the land, it has to hand back the land to the govt by 2028, after bringing down all the buildings within the forest.There are about 3,000 voters in the estate, a majority of whom are dalits, belonging to the scheduled caste community. The workers say caste is not a major factor here, and that they live in harmony, celebrating festivals together.Robert Chandra Kumar was among the first of the youngsters to leave the village for higher studies and is a practising advocate at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. “We have lived here (Manjolai) for five generations, and though my parents have told me about the birthplaces of my grandparents (elsewhere in Tirunelveli district), I have no connection to my ancestral villages,” he says.The BBTCL has offered voluntary retirement to its workers for pensions ranging from 1.45lakh to 3lakh, but if the workers reach 60 years of age, they are not eligible for any compensation, says Robert. “A few lakhs of rupees mean a lot to these workers as their daily wage is 450.”Ward councillor S Stalin says the people know no other livelihood. “They have lived in the cool climate of Manjolai for nearly 95 years. Living in warmer climes in the plains could prove detrimental to them.”For the youngsters who have now completed their higher education and moved to cities, the tea estates provide nostalgia, not a livelihood. But for the older generation, it is their bread and butter. “Who will be willing to welcome or take care of those above 70? How can people like them start a new life in the plains?” asks John Kennady, a worker from Nalumukku.M Jayashree, 46, a tea factory worker, says she has worked as a permanent employee for 16 years, and has 13 more years of service. “They are asking us to find employment elsewhere but where will we go? Manjolai is our mainstay, our identity, what job will a tea factory worker like me get?” she asks. Jayashree adds that many of her co-workers have started losing sleep as they don’t have any other roots, don’t own houses, and have children to fend for. “What can one do with 3 lakhs?’ she asks.The residents have just one request to the government - to allow these estates to remain undisturbed and bring Manjolai under the Tamilnadu Tea Plantation Corporation Limited ( Tantea ), like it did with the estates in Nilgiris and Coimbatore districts to protect the resettled Sri Lankan tea estate workers .“We don’t claim rights to the land, we just want it protected,” they say. “Unlike tea estates, where the estate owners have started promoting tourism, Manjolai remains unspoilt. It is a well-preserved ecosystem, which can remain so, if real estate does not ruin it,” says Robert.The workers have been the guardians of the forest for nearly a century, and almost all the trees have been protected, Robert adds. “Some of Tamil Nadu’s oldest trees in the area are in the Manjolai estate. Unlike other estate regions like Valparai, no major incidents of man-animal conflict have been reported here.”The only untoward incident occurred on July 23, 1999, when hundreds of workers marched towards the Tirunelveli collectorate demanding higher wages from the meagre 70 that they were receiving. Police lathi-charged the protesting workers and as the crowds ran helter-skelter, 17 workers drowned in the Thamirabarani river that flows through the district in the plains.Some of the female workers say that all the political parties had campaigned in their region during the Lok Sabha elections, but did not comment on their livelihood. “We still believe that the govt should at least keep the company running. The future of our children studying in Class X at the Manjolai high school remains uncertain,” they say.When contacted, Tirunelveli district collector K P Karthikeyan said they were waiting for the workers and the factory administration to come to a consensus. “I have spoken to them. The sub collector of Cheranmadevi and joint commissioner for labour are also in regular contact with the labourers,” he said. The estate administration is said to be offering alternative employment to workers in some of their other estates in Tamil Nadu, including in Valparai and Ooty in addition to the VRS offer. “As the model code of conduct is in effect we cannot make any major decision, and it will be decided after the workers and their employer agree on something,” said Karthikeyan.“The government will take its decision based on the outcome of the talks.” A meeting between the factory administration and workers scheduled on May 18, was called off.","Manjolai, in Tirunelveli district, is home to 2,500 people, including estate workers.

"INDIA bloc likely to demand withdrawal of 18% GST on life, medical insurance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bloc-likely-to-demand-withdrawal-of-18-gst-on-life-medical-insurance/articleshow/112231300.cms,"NEW DELHI: The INDIA parties are likely to take up the demand for withdrawal of 18% GST on life and medical insurance premiums in a big way.The demand, first raised by opposition Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) in Rajya Sabha on July 29, saw the party leading a walkout from over it on Friday, with INDIA bloc partner DMK joining the protest by walking out and Shiv Sena (UBT) member joining the chorus for roll back in Lok Sabha.The issue that affects middle class across the country, could snowball into a big issue against the government, with opposition parties threatening to take it up in the streets if the government fails to roll back the tax of insurance premiums.Interestingly, the issue initiated by the opposition, got a new dimension when road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari wrote to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 31, urging her to consider withdrawing the tax on insurance premiums or “uncertainties of life,” as he put it, two days after TMC MP Saket Gokhale raised it in Rajya Sabha.A day after Gadkari’s letter, West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee threatened to take to the streets if the government did not roll back the GST on insurance premiums. “Our demand to Government of India is to roll back GST from life and medical insurance premium on the grounds of people’s health imperatives. This GST is bad because it adversely affects the people’s ability to take care of their basic vital needs. If the Government of India does not roll back the anti-people GST, we will be bound to hit the roads,” Banerjee posted on X on Thursday.On Friday she also wrote a letter to Sitharaman, expressing “deep anguish” while highlighting how the GST on insurance premiums “increases the financial burden on the common man.”On Friday, TMC leader in Lok Sabha, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, urged the government to withdraw the GST on life and medical insurance premiums. Soon after Question Hour in the lower House, Bandyopadhyay raised the issue, saying “the 18 % GST charged over life insurance premiums and medical insurance should be withdrawn. This GST is anti-people, it is adversely affecting the people of India,"" with several INDIA bloc members -- DMK and Shiv Sena -- backing him in Lok Sabha. TMC MP Sharmila Sarkar also spoke on the same lines.While TMC and DMK walked out, alleging that there was no clarification from the government on the issue, Sena (UBT) MP Rajabhau Waje also demanded rol back of GST from insurance premiums.Gadkari’s letter to the FM said, ""Levying GST on life insurance premium amounts to levying tax on the uncertainties of life. The (LIC, Nagpur) Union feels that the person who covers the risk of life's uncertainties to give some protection to the family should not be levied tax on the premium to purchase cover against this risk. Similarly, the 18% GST on medical insurance premium is proving to be a deterrent for the growth of this segment of business which is socially necessary.""","The demand, first raised by opposition Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) in Rajya Sabha on July 29, saw the party leading a walkout from over it on Friday. INDIA bloc partner DMK joined the protest by walking out and Shiv Sena (UBT) member joined the chorus for roll back in Lok Sabha.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112231312,imgsize-1284718,width-400,resizemode-4/112231312.jpg"
"After Wayanad landslides, Centre issues 6th draft notification proposing over 56k sq km of Western Ghats eco sensitive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-wayanad-landslides-centre-issues-6th-draft-notification-proposing-over-56k-sq-km-of-western-ghats-eco-sensitive/articleshow/112231199.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three days after the massive landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, the Centre on Friday released a sixth draft notification proposing earmarking of 56,825 sq km as ecologically sensitive area ( ESA ) to prohibit/regulate environmentally hazardous human activities within the fragile Western Ghats , spread over six states.The draft for the first time proposed a provision where the final ESA notification can be taken up “in a phased manner either state-wise or through a combined single notification” - a move which may speed up the process without waiting for all six states to be on board at the same time.The proposed ESA includes Kerala’s 9,993 sq km which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30. The ESA issue has been pending since August 2011 when a central panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, recommended the govt to take it up on priority to save the fragile terrain in six states.The environment ministry that notified the sixth draft in official gazette a day after the tragedy on Wednesday said the proposal would be “taken into consideration” for publishing final notification of ESA on or after the expiry of a period of sixty days from the date on which copies of the gazette are made available to the public.The ministry, meanwhile, sought “objections or suggestions” on the proposals contained in the draft. Except for the provision of notification in a “phased manner”, the sixth draft broadly replicates the fifth one, issued in July 2022, whose validity expired on June 30.Accordingly, it proposed the ESA of 20,668 sq km in Karnataka; 17,340 sq km in Maharashtra; 6,914 sq km in Tamil Nadu; 1,461 sq km in Goa and 449 sq km in Gujarat, and recommended prohibiting or regulating certain human activities in those areas.The draft proposed complete ban on mining, quarrying, sand mining and high polluting (Red category) industries. It said all existing mines will be phased out within five years from the date of issue of the final notification or on the expiry of the existing mining lease (whichever is earlier).Besides, it also prohibited setting up any new thermal power projects and expansion of existing power plants within the ESA. Construction of projects of 20,000 sq m and above; and all new and expansion of townships, and development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built up area of 1.5 lakh sq m and above will also be prohibited after final notification.On the other hand, it proposed regulation of hydro-power projects, essential services and low-polluting (Orange & White categories) industries.The need for a sixth draft arose as states failed to come on board for earmarking ESA within their respective jurisdiction in the Western Ghats. The first draft notification to earmark ESA was issued in March, 2014 but the proposal remains on paper since then. In the meantime, the ministry had issued four more drafts in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.The central govt and an expert committee had discussed the fifth draft with states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu - nine times during July, 2022-March, 2024 but it could not finalise the ESA notification due to objection from states - initially from Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa and later mainly from Karnataka.The then Karnataka govt even requested the Centre to withdraw the draft notification in 2022, arguing that ESA, covering 20,668 sq km of area within the state, would adversely affect the livelihood of people due to ban on certain activities.The draft, however, clearly specifies that agriculture, plantation and less polluting activities will not be affected due to the ESA provisions and the actual area will be finalised based on the recommendation of the states.","The proposed ESA includes Kerala’s 9,993 sq km which includes 13 villages in two talukas of Wayanad district including Noolpuzha that was hit by landslides on July 30.

In the 21st century, a new 'Chakravyuh' has been formed - that too in the form of a Lotus. The Prime Minister wears its symbol on his chest.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday conducted first ever raids in the Union Territory of Ladakh as part of its money laundering probe linked to a cryptocurrency fraud case in which it is alleged that 2,508 investors lost more than Rs 7 crore worth of deposits, officials said.The searches, carried out by the agency's zonal office, targeted at least six locations across Leh town in Ladakh, Jammu in Jammu and Kashmir , and Sonipat in Haryana in the case against A R Mir and others.The case of money laundering originated from an FIR lodged in Leh in March 2020, along with several other complaints filed within the Jammu and Kashmir against individuals named Mir and Ajay Kumar Choudhary.A fraudulent cryptocurrency venture operating under the name ""Emollient Coin Limited"" allegedly duped 2,508 investors who invested Rs 7,34,36,267 in the investment plan offered by Mir and the company, Emollient, which was incorporated in September 2017 with its registered office in London. The company's director was a man named Henry Maxwell, residing in the UK capital.The investors never received any returns or currency back, as the funds were misappropriated by the company's promoters to buy land assets in Jammu.According to the FIR filed by the Leh police, a committee established by the local district magistrate conducted an investigation into Mir and his agents who were operating the fraudulent cryptocurrency business called Emollient Coin Limited from an office situated at the Anjuman Moin-Ul-complex, opposite SNM Hospital, in Leh.The committee sealed the office during the inquiry, alleging that they were ""cheating many innocent individuals by assuring them to double their investment.""As per ED officials, the accused enticed individuals from the UT of Ladakh and other regions to invest in ""Emollient Coin"" using cash or bank transfers. The depositors were also deceived with the promise of returns up to 40 percent with a lock-in period of 10 months, in the name of ""Bitcoins"".The ED discovered that investors were offered a commission of up to 7 per cent of the investment made by people they referred to the business, creating a multi-level marketing scheme.Naresh Gullia and Channi Singh were the company's two promoters in India. In March 2019, the company was ""deliberately"" dissolved, and Mir, along with Choudhary, ventured into the real estate business, acquiring lands in Jammu using the funds generated from the fraudulent cryptocurrency trade.","The Enforcement Directorate conducted first ever raids in the Union Territory of Ladakh as part of its money laundering probe linked to a cryptocurrency fraud case.

Explained: What 'high levels of testosterone' means amid gender row in boxing at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/explained-what-high-levels-of-testosterone-means-amid-gender-row-in-boxing-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112205038.cms,"(With inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Algerian boxer Imane Khelif 's shock 46-second win over her Italian opponent at the Paris Olympics on Thursday sparked a row, as she was previously disqualified due to reportedly high testosterone levels.Far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was among the critics, questioning Khelif's participation in the Games.The controversy has highlighted broader discussions about the role of testosterone in sports.Testosterone is a sex hormone produced by both men and women. However men produce up to 20 times more testosterone -- primarily in the testicles.Women make far less, in the ovaries and adrenal glands.A normal level of testosterone for men is estimated to be 10 to 35 nanomoles per litre in blood, according to the US Mount Sinai hospital.For women, it is between 0.5 to 2.4 nmol per litre.Testosterone levels can also vary widely by age and time of year.When people naturally produce an excess of sex hormones such as testosterone, it is called hyperandrogenism.The condition affects an estimated five percent of women, with around 70 percent of cases caused by polycystic ovary syndrome, research has found.Symptoms include acne, body hair growth and scalp hair loss.Testosterone can promote bone and muscle mass -- deliberately boosting levels is a common form of doping and is banned.Research has suggested that people with an excess of testosterone are over-represented in elite sport.But just how much the hormone boosts performance remains a matter of debate.The International Olympic Committee's head of human rights Magali Martowicz said in 2021 that there no was no ""scientific consensus"" on how testosterone affects athletic performance.At the 2021 Tokyo Games, New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender woman to take part in an Olympic event.To qualify, she had to keep her testosterone levels below 10 nmol per litre for at least 12 months.In spite of meeting the requirements, Hubbard's participation was widely criticised.At the end of 2021, the IOC gave up on establishing uniform guidelines for this kind of participation criteria, leaving it to the separate international sport federations.Khelif was disqualified during the boxing world championships last year after ""elevated levels of testosterone failed to meet the eligibility criteria,"" according to the IOC's website.Khelif and boxer Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting were both disqualified from the New Delhi event by the International Boxing Association (IBA) under Russian oligarch Umar Kremlev.However because of governance, financial and ethical issues at the IBA, it was effectively expelled from the Olympic movement last year. The IOC has taken responsibility for organising the boxing at the Paris Games.In a statement on Wednesday, the IBA said the two boxers ""did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential"".IOC spokesman Mark Adams said everyone taking part in the women's event was ""complying with competition eligibility rules"".""These athletes have competed many times before for many years, they haven't just arrived, they competed in Tokyo,"" he said.""Testosterone is not a perfect test. Many women can have testosterone which is in what would be called 'male levels' and still be women, still compete as women,"" he said.""This idea that suddenly you do one test for testosterone and that sorts everything out -- not the case, I'm afraid,"" he added.""I hope we're all agreed that we're not calling for people to go back to the bad old days of sex testing, which was a terrible thing to do.""",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's shock 46-second win over her Italian opponent sparks row.

PATNA: Power outages still haunt Bihar but residents of a village in Samastipur believed a frequently tripping transformer was ""haunted"" and promptly switched to sorcery as a cure. Locals in Rahtoli said the transformer had been tripping and catching fire several times in over a month, leaving the Dalit-majority village in Shivaji Nagar area in darkness.On Thursday, an unnamed exorcist , clad in red, chanted mantras and had aides dance to drum-beats in front of the transformer, conjuring up a surreal scene in an era of technology leaps. Videos went viral soon after. The raucous rituals, with incense sticks and invocations, below the transformer lasted over 30 minutes as curious villagers looked on.""At the end of it all, the exorcist told us that the transformer was not haunted by evil spirits but rather by the ghost of corruption ,"" a villager, Saroj Kumar, said, adding the exorcist had advised them to consult the electricity department instead.According to the villagers, they had called in the exorcist after a local mechanic failed to fix the problem. ""The mechanic tried but said the problem was beyond his control and that the transformer was under an evil spirit's influence. We decided to then get the exorcist, but the problem remains unsolved,"" said Sanjay Kumar, another villager.Power officials took a dim view of the episode. Anand Kumar, executive engineer of the North Bihar Power Distribution Company Ltd in Samastipur, dismissed the rituals as nonsense. ""There are many reasons for a transformer tripping, such as faulty electrical connections and overload,"" Kumar told TOI. According to him, the bizarre attempt was ""aimed at creating sensation and nothing else"".","Locals in Rahtoli, Bihar, sought exorcist after transformer tripped several times in a month.

Controversy over the sex of athletes is not new to competitive sports. The question of whether a male athlete has ended up competing in the female category arose again in the boxing ring at the Paris Games.So, why is Algerian boxer Imane Khelif facing allegations of being a male competing as a female?It all boils down to how much testosterone one is exposed to while growing up. Experts have concluded that biological males have ""higher levels of testosterone during growth, development, and throughout the athletic career"". Why is testosterone important? It determines muscle size, bone growth and strength. All this means that women are ""on average, unable to compete effectively against men in power-based or endurance-based sports"".Experts note that while there is no difference in testosterone levels and physical performance before the onset of puberty, major changes kick in thereafter. After males enter puberty, their testosterone levels rise by up to 30 times. That means men can have ""15to 20-fold greater circulating testosterone than children or women at any age"". In fact, women's categories exist in most sports in recognition of the clear advantage that going through male puberty gives an athlete.Women can have high levels of testosterone owing to 'differences of sexual development', or DSD, which are a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs. Some people with DSDs are raised as female but have XY sex chromosomes, blood testosterone levels in the male range and the ability to use testosterone circulating within their bodies. What are chromosomes? They are DNA molecules that contain genetic information of an organism. Women have two X chromosomes, while men have one X and one Y chromosome.Persons displaying XY DSD, that is, male hormonal characteristics, can experience higher levels of testosterone than women athletes. Carole Hooven , a former Harvard University faculty member, said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that such athletes are ""often described as females with 'hyperandrogenism', i.e., abnormally high levels of testosterone"". She argues that they ""experience physical benefits of this high testosterone during puberty, which translate into athletic advantages over females"". She explains that such persons ""are usually born with female-appearing genitalia, which can lead to being sexed as female"".But the issue of physical advantage is not without debate. For instance, an endocrinologist argued on X that even if Khelif has XY DSD, ""there's no convincing evidence that Y chromosome/ part of Y chromosome alone gives her an unassailable competitive edge"". Karthik Balachandran adds that the fact that Khelif has been beaten many times before by women boxers should lay to rest any controversy regarding her participation as a woman.Asked about the Khelif episode, a spokesman for International Olympic Committee (IOC) said that it is the sports federations that are mandated to make rules regarding classification and fairness.IOC may not itself conduct sex tests, but at the Paris Games it was in charge of the boxing competition. That's because the sport's global body, International Boxing Association (IBA), was derecognised by IOC last year over governance, finance and ethical issues.IOC defended its decision to allow Khelif to compete, with its spokesman saying, ""I would just say that everyone competing in the women's category is complying with the competition eligibility rules. They are women in their passports and it is stated that is the case."" Social media commentators said that Khelif's medical records are not in the public domain and, hence, it's unfair to say DSD is involved in this case. Though some have pointed to her disqualification last year at an event.At last year's world championships in New Delhi, Khelif was disqualified hours before her gold medal match for falling foul of IBA eligibility rules preventing athletes with XY chromosomes from competing in women's events. Taiwan's double world champion Lin Yu-ting - also taking part in Paris - lost her bronze medal after she too failed to meet the criteria.Over the past couple of years, the governing bodies of athletics, cycling, swimming and rugby union have been tightening their regulations to exclude those with the advantage of going through male puberty.The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) introduced new eligibility rules in 2019 for female or intersex athletes with XY sex chromosomes, testes instead of ovaries, a blood testosterone level ""in the male range"", and androgen-sensitivity. To compete in track events between 400m and one mile, such individuals should ""lower their blood testosterone levels to under 5 nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) 'because that is the highest level that a healthy woman with ovaries would have'. Athletes have to do this for at least six months to become eligible and maintain that level continuously in and out of competition to remain eligible.The South African runner came under scrutiny in 2009 when questions were raised about her sex. Later, it was found she has an intersex condition and natural testosterone levels in the typical male range. Semenya is barred from competing in any distance between 400m and a mile (1.6 km) since 2018 unless she maintains lower testosterone levels, which requires medication.Soundarajan won the 800m silver at the 2006 Asian Games in Qatar. Subsequently, the Indian athlete failed a gender test and was stripped of her medal after being ruled as not possessing sexual characteristics of a woman.The 100m sprinter won the 200m bronze at the 2013 Asian Championships in Pune. But she was dropped from the Indian squad before the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014 because she failed a hormone test. She was found to have a condition called hyperandrogenism with her body producing natural levels of testosterone that are high enough to place her in the male range.Retired American gymnast Aly Raisman has spoken about being bullied for her muscular arms. In an Instagram post in 2016, she wrote: ""Shoutout to all the boys from 5th-9th grade who made fun of me for being 'too strong'... My muscular arms that were considered weird and gross when I was younger have made me one of the best gymnasts on the planet…""","Algerian boxer Imane Khelif accused of being a male competing as a female. Women's categories exist in most sports in recognition of the clear advantage that going through male puberty gives an athlete.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
H1B Scam: What is H-1B lottery scam? Who is Indian-American Kandi Srinivasa Reddy allegedly behind this?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-h-1b-lottery-scam-who-is-indian-american-kandi-srinivasa-reddy-behind-this/articleshow/112205692.cms,"10 things you need to know about Reddy and H-1B scam

The scam is based on a process called 'multiple registrations'. If one individual submits many applications under different company names, chances of getting selected in the lottery that takes place every April increases. Srinivasa Reddy controlled several companies which had shared addresses -- like Cloud Big Data Technologies LLC, Machine Learning Technologies LLC through which he rigged the system and got hundreds of H-1B visas. Those who applied for H-1B visa through Reddy's companies were assured of the visa. The system created disadvantage for companies that follow rules. Reddy created what Bloomberg called ""the Amazon of staffing"". A Telugu NRI, Reddy studied masters in the US and worked as a tech consultant as he settled there. After Reddy got a worker a visa, it used to take 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the worker's pay -- which is around $15,000 or more each year. In the 2020 lottery, Reddy's Cloud Big Data submitted some 288 names. At the same time, other companies under Reddy submitted the same names. His companies in 2020 entered the lottery more than 3,000 times. Reddy told Bloomberg that he is just a registered agent for the companies and has no involvement in them but official documents say otherwise. In his election data, he said he is the owner of all the staffing companies. Reddy has a foundation to help farmers in his hometown in India. He also has his own television and online news operation. Reddy told TOI that there is nothing illegal in what he did. ""When multiple visa entries are filed, the choice is up to the employees to choose which company they would like. From 20924, changes were made, and passport numbers need to be entered. Now, if multiple entries are filled, it will reflect everywhere,"" he said.

A major H-1B lottery scam has surfaced in which multiple companies submitted multiple applications for the same individuals rigging the system of getting American visas. Kandi Srinivasa Reddy, an Indian-American businessman, has been named behind the fraud. Interestingly, Reddy was a candidate of the Congress, now the ruling party in Telangana in the recent local election -- and lost.An investigation by Bloomberg has unearthed the scam going on for some years and now many other firms are doing the same.","Scam is based on a process called'multiple registrations' If one individual submits many applications under different company names, chances of getting selected in the lottery increases.

Our planet is home to billions of people, each navigating the complexities of daily life through work, thought, play, and planning. In the midst of this chaos, some individuals manage to stay focused and disciplined, creating entirely new perspectives on life, the universe, and its meaning. Among these exceptional individuals are those who receive Nobel Prizes.The Nobel Prizes are far from ordinary awards.Established in 1895 by Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel, they honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine. Laureates receive a diploma, a gold medal, and a monetary award, which usually exceeds $1 million. While most prizes are awarded to individuals, the Peace Prize can also go to organisations. Occasionally, multiple recipients share a prize, but no more than three people can share one award.Since their inception in 1901, Nobel Prizes have been awarded 573 times to 900 recipients and organisations. Some have won more than once. Although prizes are generally awarded annually, there may be years when no prize is given if no achievement meets the high standards set.The significance of these awards lies not just in the accolades themselves but in the groundbreaking work they recognize. Nobel laureates are trailblazers who dedicate their lives to uncovering the mysteries of our existence, thereby advancing human knowledge and understanding. This article highlights ten such transformative figures who have made a profound impact on our world.Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, made significant contributions to science with her research on radioactivity. Born in 1867, Curie and her husband Pierre, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for their studies on radiation. She later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her discoveries of radium and polonium, becoming the first individual to receive Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. During World War I, Curie applied her knowledge to develop mobile X-ray units, enhancing battlefield medical care. Her groundbreaking work continues to impact medicine and technology, and her daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935.Albert Einstein transformed our understanding of physics and the universe. Awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which showed that light consists of particles, Einstein’s work laid the foundation for technologies such as television and motion pictures. His theories of relativity further revolutionised physics, reshaping our perception of time, space, and the fundamental nature of reality. Einstein's contributions advanced both quantum theory and technological innovations.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times: in 1917, 1944, and 1963. Founded in Geneva in 1863, the ICRC is committed to providing aid to the wounded and sick in wartime, regardless of nationality. It plays a vital role in upholding the Geneva Conventions, documenting violations, and assisting prisoners of war and civilians. The ICRC’s efforts exemplify humanitarian principles amidst global conflicts.Alexander Fleming, Ernst Chain, and Howard Florey were honoured with the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of penicillin. Fleming discovered that mould (Penicillium notatum) produced an antibacterial substance, leading to the development of penicillin-based antibiotics. These antibiotics revolutionised medicine by effectively treating diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, and syphilis, thereby saving countless lives.Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her extensive charitable work. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Catholic organisation dedicated to helping the poor, sick, and orphaned in India. The organisation expanded its mission to assist those affected by AIDS, war, and famine. Mother Teresa’s lifelong commitment to humanitarian work continues through her organisation, which operates in over 130 countries and supports thousands of people in need.Ivan Pavlov, awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology, is renowned for his research on conditioned reflexes. His experiments with dogs demonstrated that they could be conditioned to salivate in response to a stimulus, such as a bell, when it was repeatedly associated with feeding. Pavlov’s work had a profound impact on psychology and behaviourism, shaping our understanding of learned behaviours. His influential research also led to significant advancements in behavioural science.Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his leadership in the American civil rights movement. King advocated for racial equality and freedom through non-violent protests and activism, notably leading the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955. His extensive efforts to combat racial discrimination and his influential speeches made a lasting impact on American society. Despite his assassination in 1968, his legacy endures as a symbol of non-violent resistance and social justice.James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the molecular structure of DNA. Their discovery of the double-helix structure was crucial in understanding genetic information transmission within organisms. Their achievements were greatly aided by Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray photographs of DNA, though her contributions were overshadowed by her male counterparts. Franklin passed away before the Nobel committee could consider her for the prize, as posthumous awards are not allowed.Hermann Muller received the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the effects of X-rays, demonstrating that they cause genetic mutations. His studies in the 1920s showed that X-rays caused genetic damage in Drosophila flies, leading him to conclude similar effects in humans. Although he struggled to publicise his findings, the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II highlighted the dangers of radiation, leading to the recognition of his work. Muller’s discoveries and his anti-nuclear stance provided a crucial counterbalance to technological advancements of the Atomic Age.Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 but1, but was unable to accept it until 2012 due to her detention by Myanmar’s oppressive military regime. Her advocacy for democracy and human rights led to her house arrest starting in 1990, which lasted intermittently until 2010. After her release, Suu Kyi led her party, the National League for Democracy, to a major electoral victory in 2015. Although she was barred from the presidency due to her sons' foreign citizenship, she served as state counsellor. However, her reputation has been marred by criticism over her handling of the Rohingya crisis, with some arguing that her power was limited by the military’s control.","The Nobel Prizes honour significant contributions in six fields: literature, peace, economics, chemistry, physics, and medicine.

Baba Vanga’s background and legacy

Baba Vanga , a blind Bulgarian mystic who died in 1996 at the age of 85, continues to captivate people worldwide with her enigmatic prophecies. Often referred to as the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans,' Vanga claimed that she gained the gift of prophecy after losing her sight at the age of twelve. Among her most famous predictions was the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in New York.One of Baba Vanga's most striking predictions was regarding the 9/11 attacks.According to Marca.com, she foresaw this tragic event, stating, ""Two metal birds will crash into our American brothers, wolves will howl from the bushes, and the blood of the innocent will flow in the rivers."" This uncannily precise prediction has kept people intrigued by her other forecasts.Baba Vanga foresaw a major conflict breaking out in Europe in 2025, resulting in a substantial decrease in the continent's population. This prediction has sparked considerable debate and concern, particularly given the current geopolitical tensions.Her most startling prediction is the world's end in 5079, caused by a cosmic event of extraordinary scale. This apocalyptic vision has intrigued and terrified many, reflecting the deep human fascination with the ultimate fate of the world.In 2028, humanity will attempt to reach Venus in search of new energy sources. She predicted that by 2033, the polar ice caps would melt, leading to a considerable rise in sea levels. This prediction aligns with contemporary concerns about climate change and its impact on global sea levels.Vanga foresaw that the Earth would meet its destruction in the year 3797. However, she claimed that by then, humanity would be capable of relocating to another planet within the solar system, ensuring the survival of the species.Baba Vanga foresaw that by 2130, humanity would establish contact with extraterrestrial civilizations.
