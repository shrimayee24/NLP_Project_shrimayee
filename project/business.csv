"Eye on China, India inks SL deal for energy hub in Trincomalee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-india-inks-sl-deal-for-energy-hub-in-trincomalee/articleshow/120027773.cms,"Poll What is your overall opinion on India’s involvement in Sri Lanka's energy sector? Negative Neutral Somewhat Positive Very Positive

Among the important takeaways from Narendra Modi's fourth visit to Sri Lanka as prime minister was a tripartite agreement - also involving the UAE - to develop the coastal district of Trincomalee in the country's northeastern part as an energy hub. Announcing the project in the traditionally Tamil-majority area, which will include a multi-product pipeline, Modi said all Sri Lankans will benefit from it.With its natural harbour and energy facilities, Trincomalee is of great strategic value for India as a strong presence there will also allow it to ramp up influence in the northeast Indian Ocean. The announcement follows Sri Lanka's securing of investments worth $3.7 billion from China's oil giant Sinopec, the largest foreign direct investment to date in the country, for an oil refinery in the southern Hambantota region during Lankan President Anura Dissanayake's visit to Beijing earlier this year. For India, it's imperative that China, which has in the past explored energy projects in islands off the Jaffna peninsula, is not allowed to make inroads into northern and eastern parts of the country.India already has an agreement with Sri Lanka for developing some of the Trincomalee oil tank farms and India could develop more under the new MoU. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the proposed energy hub is an initiative designed to ensure Sri Lanka's energy security, provisioning of energy at affordable rates, and also to possibly contribute revenue for the country through export of energy. As a major strategic and energy partner, the UAE was an ideal partner for the first of its kind project in the region.In line with their growing strategic convergence, India and the UAE had agreed in 2018 to jointly work on development projects in third countries.Also read: Modi assures Sri Lanka help in dealing with Trump tariff fallout ""And what the exact contours of the UAE role will be is something that is going to be elaborated once the B2B discussions kick off under this MoU,"" said Misri.""The immediate next step that will be enabled by this framework MoU is the identification and the nomination of specific agencies and entities that could be govt entities or private sector entities or could be entities related to the govts themselves that will try and realise the business-to-business part of this agreement,"" added the official.","India and the UAE signed a tripartite agreement to develop the coastal district of Trincomalee in the country's northeastern part as an energy hub.

The Lok Sabha had passed the legislation earlier this week after a 13-hour marathon debate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the move as a “watershed moment,” saying that the waqf system had long suffered from a lack of transparency and accountability. “This legislation will boost transparency and safeguard people’s rights,” he posted on X.The Act aims to reform the governance of waqf properties, enhance transparency in dealings, and ensure representation from different Muslim sects in waqf boards. It also includes provisions to safeguard heritage sites, improve social welfare, and support the economic inclusion of marginalized groups, including Muslim widows and divorcees.Minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, who piloted the Bill, said it would benefit millions of poor Muslims and asserted it does not interfere with waqf properties. “This legislation is based on extensive stakeholder consultation and incorporates recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee,” he said. He clarified that the Central Waqf Council would comprise 22 members, with no more than four non-Muslims, ensuring the body remains secular yet representative.Opposition leaders, however, accused the government of pushing a divisive agenda. Congress MP Dr Syed Naseer Hussain said the Bill was misleading and intended for communal polarisation. DMK’s Tiruchi Siva called it anti-secular and unconstitutional, while TMC’s Mohammad Nadimul Haque said it violates fundamental rights. AAP’s Sanjay Singh urged the government to withdraw the Bill.Union home minister Amit Shah countered that the opposition was misguiding people. BJP’s JP Nadda emphasised that the Bill aligns with UMEED — Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development — to modernise property administration.Supporting the Bill, JD(S) chief and former PM HD Devegowda said waqf properties had long been misused by elites. BJP MP Radha Mohan Das said previous governments had neglected the upliftment of poor Muslims, and the Modi government is working to bring them into the mainstream.Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a withdrawal of the Bill, citing constitutional concerns. AIADMK’s Dr M Thambidurai supported changes in board composition, while Minister Ramdas Athawale claimed the Bill integrates all minority communities.Alongside this legislation, parliament also approved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, which repeals the century-old Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923, aiming to eliminate outdated provisions.As the new law comes into force, political debate continues over its long-term impact — whether it will empower marginalised communities or, as critics claim, centralise control and erode minority autonomy.","President Droupadi Murmu has given her assent to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025.

We have said what we had to say and made our decision. This file is closed for us now.”His remarks come a day after he sharply criticised the Bill, alleging that it was less about protecting Muslim interests and more about facilitating a business-like acquisition of Waqf land and property by the government. Raut had claimed the move was driven by an interest in Waqf assets worth an estimated Rs 2 lakh crore.While the Shiv Sena (UBT) is stepping back, several other leaders have already taken the matter to the Supreme Court.

Why PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka matters now

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake ’s assurance that the island nation “will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India,” calling the gesture a reaffirmation of the deep trust between the two neighbours and a statement that appeared to assuage concerns about China's growing influence over neighbours.“Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar said—what could be bigger protection against the enemy if not the shield of a true friend and his friendship?” PM Modi said, adding, “President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had chosen India for his first foreign visit. Today, I am his first foreign guest here in Sri Lanka. It shows the depths of our special relationship. Sri Lanka has a special place in our neighbourhood first policy and mission SAGAR.”Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri added context to the growing strategic partnership: “The President of Sri Lanka stated very clearly that Sri Lankan territory will not be used or be allowed to be used in any manner that is inimical or detrimental to India’s interests. During discussions today, he said that neither Sri Lanka's land nor the oceans around it will be allowed to be used in any manner inimical to India’s security.”He said the remarks set the stage for a milestone development. “This is the background of the signature of the Defence MoU between the two countries for the first time, and the MoU is in itself an umbrella framework document that will make existing defence cooperation initiatives more structured.”President Dissanayake also acknowledged India’s regional role and sought its support in key bilateral issues. “I reaffirmed Sri Lanka's stand that it will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India as well as towards regional stability,” he said. “I requested Prime Minister Modi's intervention in convening early bilateral technical discussions pertaining to Sri Lanka's claim to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for the establishment of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone.”He also highlighted the countries’ collaboration in technology and digital transformation . “Sri Lanka recognizes the importance of developing a digital economy to drive growth, innovation and efficiency. Furthering this policy initiative, Prime Minister Modi and I discussed possible collaboration in digitalization in multiple domains,” he said. “I thank the Government of India for the financial grant of Indian Rupees 300 crores to implement Sri Lanka's unique Digital Identity Project.”Chinese investments and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka to develop its economy have raised concerns ranging from sovereignty and security issues.Beijing’s control of the Hambantota Port—secured on a 99-year lease after Colombo defaulted on loan repayments—has enabled Chinese surveillance vessels, such as the Yuan Wang 5, to operate near India’s southern coast. Despite protests from New Delhi in 2022, Sri Lanka allowed Chinese ships to dock at Hambantota for “replenishment,” a practice that continues.China has also pledged a record $3.7 billion investment in Sri Lanka following President Dissanayake’s recent visit to Beijing. The funds will be used to build a new oil refinery at Hambantota as part of an upgraded Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) agreement.PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka is more than a goodwill gesture—it marks a pivotal step in deepening defence and strategic cooperation between the two nations at a time of growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean region.The visit is expected to culminate in the signing of a key defence cooperation agreement, signalling a reset in India-Sri Lanka military ties that have remained cautious since the withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) from the island nearly 35 years ago.PM Modi arrived in Colombo on Friday evening and was welcomed at the Bandaranaike International Airport by five senior Sri Lankan ministers, including Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Health Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, and Fisheries Minister Ramalingam Chandrasekar.On Saturday morning, he received a ceremonial welcome at Independence Square by President Dissanayake, underlining the importance both nations attach to their long-standing ties.",PM Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka is more than a goodwill gesture.

Some opposition parties and political figures are likely to knock Supreme Court's doors against the proposed law on various grounds.They alleged that the sweeping changes brought under Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act ""curtailed religious and cultural autonomy of Muslims, enabled arbitrary executive interference, and undermined minority rights to manage their religious and charitable institutions"".The petitions, filed by advocate Adeel Ahmed, questioned introduction of non-Muslim members in waqf boards and Central Waqf Council. ""Principle of equality before the law demands that any classification must be based on intelligible differentia and bear a rational nexus to objective of the law. However, this amendment arbitrarily interferes with religious affairs of Muslim minority, while similar restrictions do not apply to non-Muslim religious institutions, thereby failing the test of fairness, reasonableness, and non-discrimination. Inclusion of non-Muslims in religious affairs of the Muslim minority is not a step toward 'inclusivity' rather, it dilutes the autonomy of an already under-represented community in India's institutional framework,"" his petition said.""In contrast, non-Muslim charitable institutions actively prohibit Muslim participation in their religious affairs, highlighting the discriminatory impact of this amendment,"" it added. The petition filed by the NGO highlighted Sachar Committee Report presents compelling evidence of abysmal socio-economic status and severe under-representation of Muslims in public institutions.Adeel Ahmed's petition also alleged that the transfer of adjudicatory powers from the tribunal to executive authorities like the district collector (Section 4) and curtailment of the tribunal's powers to stay (Section 83) amounted to denial of fair procedure. ""The drastic overhaul proposed by UMEED Bill is not only unnecessary but also an alarming interference into religious affairs of Muslim community diluting the fundamental purpose of waqf,"" it said.""The petitioner humbly submits that UMEED Bill is an unconstitutional and unjustified legislative overreach that must be struck down in the interest of upholding fundamental rights, individual freedom and religious autonomy guaranteed under the Constitution,"" it added.",The Waqf Amendment Bill received President Droupadi Murmu's assent late Saturday evening.

Won't let our land be used against India: SL President,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wont-let-our-land-be-used-against-india-sl-president/articleshow/120024573.cms,"Modi 1st foreign head to visit Lanka in Dissanayake tenure

NEW DELHI: Amid growing Chinese footprint in the Indian Ocean, India signed its first ever MoU for defence cooperation with Sri Lanka that will help both sides formalise and enhance cooperation between their armed forces. The agreement was one of the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's ongoing visit to the strategically-located neighbour that also saw a major boost for energy ties in the form of a grid inter-connectivity agreement that will allow Sri Lanka to export electricity and another MoU for developing Trincomalee as an energy hub.The bilateral meeting was followed by signing of seven MoUs and agreements. The leaders acknowledged that the security interests of India and Sri Lanka are interlinked and the President reassured India that he won't allow Lankan land or, as foreign secretary Vikram Misri recalled after the bilateral meeting, the oceans around it to be used in any way inimical to India's security interests or regional stability.""We believe that we have shared security interests. The security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent,"" said Modi, thanking Dissanayake for his sensitivity towards India's interests.Modi also announced a debt restructuring agreement that he said will provide immediate assistance and relief to the people of Sri Lanka, along with reduced interest rates on loans. ""Today, we have also decided to reduce interest rates. It symbolises that even today, India stands with the people of Sri Lanka. For the social and economic development of the Eastern Provinces, a support package of approximately 2.4 billion Lankan rupees (around Rs 70 crore) will be provided,"" he said. India had earlier extended an aid package worth $4 billion to Sri Lanka to help the Indian Ocean country from a food and fuel crisis.Modi, the first foreign leader to visit Sri Lanka since the President assumed office last year, quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar to say that in the face of challenges and enemies, there is no stronger assurance than a true friend and the shield of his friendship.On the sensitive issue of fishermen, the two decided to handle it with a humane approach with Modi emphasising on immediate release of fishermen and their boats.On the Tamil issue, Dissanayake briefed Modi about his “inclusive” approach and the Indian PM expressed hope that the Sri Lankan govt would meet the aspirations of the Tamil people and fulfil its commitment towards fully implementing the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and conducting provincial council elections. Like in their last meeting in Dec, when Dissanayake visited India, Modi did not specifically refer to the 13th Amendment for the devolution of power to the provinces.“Relations between India and Sri Lanka are based on mutual trust and goodwill. We will continue to work together to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of our people,” said Modi.Briefing the media about the defence MoU, Misri said it will make existing defence cooperation initiatives more structured. “There will be activities related to, of course, the continuing and even intensifying the tradition of high-level visits between the two countries, more joint exercises, capacity building in various areas, exchanges in HADR related operations, increasing port calls by naval units of both countries, and also to explore defence industry cooperation between the two sides,” said Misri.On conclusion of the debt restructuring process, Misri said India has been pursuing an investment-led strategy with Sri Lanka, together with a grant assistance-oriented approach to ensure that Sri Lanka is firmly on the path to sustainable and long-term economic recovery. In his address, Modi also said that loans worth $100 million had been converted into grants in the past six months.",India signs its first ever MoU for defence cooperation with Sri Lanka.

"Omar Abdullah govt backs quota review outside, opposes it in court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-govt-backs-quota-review-outside-opposes-it-in-court/articleshow/120023736.cms,"SRINAGAR: Omar Abdullah govt has landed in a political hotspot after asking HC to dismiss a petition that calls J&K’s policy of high reservations anti-merit and seeks its rationalisation. The govt’s move is at odds with its long-standing position that the quotas need to be re-examined and its decision to set up a cabinet committee for the review.The govt’s stand in the HC has been spelt out in an affidavit filed on Friday by the social welfare department, whose minister Sakina Itoo heads the cabinet sub-committee. As the govt came under attack from opposition, Itoo suggested Saturday that the affidavit was a mistake and a fresh one would be drawn up.The petition argues that changes brought in reservations laws after abrogation of Article 370 has limited access to open merit candidates to govt jobs and education institutions. Filed last Dec by a lawyer, Zahoor Ahmad Bhat, and some others, the plea contends that the changes reduce open merit seats from 57% to 33%.In its affidavit, the govt said the plea should be dismissed with heavy costs in spite of the fact that it set up the cabinet after massive protests last Dec against the quotas. The affidavit describes the existing reservation policy as constitutional and insists that amendments brought in after abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019 has not violated any rights, “whether fundamental, legal or statutory.” It also argues that the govt is entitled to include or exclude any particular section to make “the country socialist in its true spirit”.Omar’s rivals seized on the apparent dichotomy. “The govt is defending a deeply flawed reservation policy in court. The so-called cabinet committee was nothing but a facade to mislead the public,” PDP MLA Waheed Parra said.Peoples Conference legislator Sajad Lone, who had flagged the issue in the assembly last month, noted the silence on the panel. “Nowhere has the govt mentioned the formation of the sub-committee. This is a legal mystery. Seems the govt is not taking its own committee seriously enough to merit a mention in its affidavit,” Lone said.During a debate on March 16 in the assembly, minister Itoo had asserted that the cabinet would examine grievances against the reservation system. Ministers Satish Sharma and Javed Rana as the other members of the panel.As the row escalated, Itoo held a presser Saturday to reaffirm the govt’s commitment to rationalising reservations. She said the govt was “looking at the circumstances” in which the affidavit was filed. The govt will come up with a report on reservations within six months and ensure the recommendations of the panel are implemented, Itoo said. “We are sincere and we are not here to mislead anyone,” the minister added.","The petition argues that changes brought in reservations laws after abrogation of Article 370 has limited access to open merit candidates to govt jobs and education institutions.

"Four centuries on, Caravaggio’s Mary Magdalene finds her way to India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/four-centuries-on-caravaggios-mary-magdalene-finds-her-way-to-india/articleshow/120020564.cms,"She leans back with her eyes closed and lips slightly parted, her face flushed with a wave of intense emotion. At her feet lies a skull — possibly a quiet reminder of the impermanence of beauty. Painted around 1606 by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, 'Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy' depicts the saint not in grief or sacrifice or with a group of disciples, but alone, suspended in a moment of pure rapture.Long considered lost, with at least eight known imitations in circulation, the original 'Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy' was rediscovered and authenticated in 2014 by Mina Gregori, the most famous Caravaggio expert. For the first time, the painting is now coming to India at an exhibition at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA).On display from April 17 to May 18, the exhibition is a result of a collaboration between the Italian Embassy Cultural Centre and KNMA, timed with the official visit of Italian deputy prime minister Antonio Tajani and minister for university and research Anna Maria Bernini.To Roobina Karode, director and chief curator of KNMA, the exhibition is not just historic — it’s a dialogue across centuries, continents and artistic vocabularies. “This is a rare opportunity for local audiences in India to see a Caravaggio in its physical, original form — not in reproduction, not in textbooks, but in its presence,” Karode says.Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571–1610) was a revolutionary Italian painter whose short, turbulent life left an outsized mark on the history of Western art. Trained in Milan and active across Rome, Naples, Malta and Sicily, he rejected the idealised figures of the Renaissance and instead painted saints and sinners with startling realism.The biblical figures in his religious paintings were not seen as distant icons but as flesh-and-blood individuals. Even in the case of Mary Magdalene — a prominent figure in Christian tradition, often described as a devoted follower of Jesus — Caravaggio’s compelling work adds to the intrigue.His signature use of chiaroscuro — the sharp contrast between light and shadow — imbued his religious scenes with a cinematic intensity that often unsettled viewers and thrilled patrons. In a life cut short mysteriously at the age of 38 while he was on the run after allegedly killing a man, Caravaggio created fewer than 90 works. However, his influence inspired generations of painters from Rembrandt to Artemisia Gentileschi, and he remains one of the most studied and mythologised figures in art history.“Since Caravaggio has never come to India, and it’s become increasingly difficult to move paintings of this stature, it’s been a long-standing dream of mine to bring his work here,” says Andrea Anastasio, director of the Italian Embassy Cultural Centre in Delhi. “If this goes smoothly, I’m hoping to bring more Caravaggios over the next two years.”The project was brought to fruition in just two and a half months — a remarkable logistical feat involving conservation protocols, high-security transport, complex insurance and bureaucratic precision. “Usually this kind of thing takes a year. The opportunity came through a chance message. The ambassador (of Italy to India, Antonio Bartoli) messaged me at seven in the morning to say that there was a Caravaggio in Beijing, on its way back to Rome. He asked, 'what if we could bring it to Delhi instead?,” Anastasio recalls.To ensure wider access and understanding, the exhibition will be accompanied by virtual reality experiences, documentary screenings and educational programs. “Caravaggio isn’t widely known in India beyond academic circles,” says Anastasio. “We want to introduce him in a more direct, less formal way. Technology can help bridge that gap.”The exhibition also opens up questions of influence. Can Caravaggio’s chiaroscuro be found in Indian visual traditions? “Modern Indian artists who’ve been exposed to Western art have definitely felt his relevance,” Anastasio says. The exhibition will run parallel to a solo show by senior artist Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, whose monumental painting titled 'Kaarawaan' places portraits of various global masters on a single symbolic boat “That’s why we’re also showing this painting next to works by Sheikh. He must have seen Caravaggio’s paintings in person. The importance of light in his compositions certainly owes something to Caravaggio.”Attention to emotional nuance and realism has resonated with Indian artists who’ve encountered Caravaggio’s work. “Artists such as A. Ramachandran, Krishen Khanna and others were moved by the drama of light and mystery of Caravaggio's style and technique of painting,” adds Karode.","The original 'Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy' was rediscovered and authenticated in 2014 by Mina Gregori, the most famous Caravaggio expert.

It will culminate in a public meeting at Jantar Mantar where leaders of other Left parties, including the CPI(M), CPI, RSP and the CPI(ML) Liberation, are expected to speak in solidarity.The Forward Bloc's primary demand is the immediate declassification of all files related to Bose, the Indian National Army (INA), and the ""Azad Hind Sarkar"", according to a statement.""Despite decades of public interest and the sacrifices made by 'Netaji' and the INA, these files remain shrouded in secrecy. The people of India have a right to know the truth,"" the party said in the statement.Transparency will help resolve the mystery around Bose's disappearance and honour the legacy of one of India's most revered freedom fighters, it added.Several reports have claimed that Bose had boarded a plane from the Taihoku airport in Taiwan in August 1945 that later crashed. There is, however, no confirmation that Bose died in the crash.The Centre constituted several commissions over the years to shed light on the mystery but none could dispel the doubts surrounding his disappearance.Raising concerns over the rising cost of living, the Forward Bloc said the continuous hike in prices of essential commodities such as food items and fuel was ""crippling"" working and middle classes.""Immediate steps must be taken to stabilise prices and protect the basic needs of common citizens,"" it said.The Left party also called for urgent action to tackle the growing unemployment crisis, especially among youngsters.It urged the government to adopt policies promoting skill development and create sustainable jobs for all, with a focus on empowering marginalised communities.The Forward Bloc also highlighted its opposition to the privatisation of national assets. It criticised the ongoing sale of public sector undertakings and key national resources, warning that such moves undermined national sovereignty and weakened public services meant for the common good.The Forward Bloc slammed what it called rising communal polarisation in the country.""The government must take a firm stand against the politics of hatred and work towards strengthening the secular fabric of India,"" it said.",All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) is organising the march under the 'Dilli Chalo' banner.

The line moves from a dot to a grid. The grid expands into patterns of structure that pause, create and slowly disperse into a formlessness that celebrates control and freedom of the breath, the mind, and the space in between. All of this takes place in the now, in the present, in the contemporary. Time moves in the form of constant nowness in Trishla Jain’s work. The two series, ‘ Yantra ’ and ‘ Tantra ’, may initially stand starkly apart from each other but, on slow immersion through time spent with each painting, the dots and dashes configure themselves differently across canvases to create new compositions. These configurations resonate with the present, which arises from a mindfulness associated with discovering the expanse of space between the breath and the mind that exists within each of us.The mind, breath, and space are three important anchors to understanding and experiencing Jain’s work. ‘Yantra’ and ‘Tantra’, Jain’s most recent series of paintings, resemble dualities and opposing parts that exist within all of us. She refers to them as ‘yin and yang, the male and female’, which allow her to bring herself to the canvas, not in fragments but as a whole. On closer observation, viewers will notice extremely structured elements such as the grid and patterns from ‘Yantra’ in the ‘Tantra’ series and vice versa.While ‘Yantra’ deals with a systematic progression of the focused, logical, and structured mind that helps understand Jain’s layers of entering the state of samadhi; ‘Tantra’ takes on the same mind in its unleashed, challenged, and boundless form, flowing free. Yet, the breath returns to centre both series of paintings.Every line, dot and grid in ‘Yantra’ is representative of the inhalation and exhalation of the artist’s breath. The centre is clearly determined within the structure until, with a slow release, the breath is let go in ‘Tantra’. By adjusting to the openness of ‘Tantra’ and observing it with time, the breath gradually returns to point out symmetry and order even in its chaos. The tiny dashes of brushstrokes are measured lines of breath and every now and then one can spot a constellation forming only to disperse back into the flow of another order.At a time when everything in our world seems driven and controlled by technology, Jain’s works invoke a sense of surrender grounded in trust that comes with letting go of control to accept freedom. There is sustained mindfulness in this achievement from observing oneself through the breath and mind in the present moment in ‘The Quiet Interlude’. With this alignment of the mind and breath, there is a very conscious space that arises within the body of work and the human body. For a form to be defined, it requires space. It is only when there is distance that one begins to observe patterns, grids, and structures.On coming too close, the detail takes over but then pushes the viewer back to create a space that allows one to be absorbed into the painting’s entirety. It is in this act of emptying that we are nourished to the brim with a contemplative energy and light which brings with it contentment, peace and harmony.","Trishla Jain’s dance of dots and dashes create a harmonious whole in her new show.

Inside Jordon Hudson’s 24th birthday bash and how she’s honoring Bill Belichick’s latest coaching move



Jordon Hudson ’s 24th birthday wasn’t just about cakes and candles—it became a heartfelt celebration of love, loyalty, and life’s unexpected journeys. The former college cheerleader and current partner of legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick used her special day to offer a unique tribute to the man who has stood beside her despite the headlines, criticism, and their 48-year age gap.On April 4, Jordon Hudson took to Instagram to showcase a thoughtful snapshot: a bouquet of red roses and a University of North Carolina basketball jersey with “Jordon” emblazoned above the number 24. It wasn’t just a birthday nod—it was a clever homage to her own age and Michael Jordan’s college legacy, all while acknowledging Belichick’s new beginning with the Tar Heels. The jersey symbolized more than a gift—it marked her deep-rooted support for Belichick as he transitions into his first-ever college football coaching role.It’s not the first time Hudson has publicly backed her partner. After facing online scrutiny over their relationship, she shared a bold message on Instagram in December 2024: ""Nothing changed for us in 2024 except for 'public knowledge': yet somehow everything changed. Going strong. I can't wait to take punches for you in 2025. Keep swinging, Keyboard Warriors. Your illusion of righteousness only fuels my authenticity."" Her statement echoed the kind of emotional resilience that often keeps high-profile relationships afloat.The pair's journey began in an unlikely setting—on a flight to Florida in February 2021. Hudson, then a college student with a passion for philosophy, had Belichick sign her “Deductive Logic” textbook. He penned a note that read, “Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels! Bill Belichick,” complete with Super Bowl win numbers. That simple exchange bloomed into a connection that, despite public skepticism, has only grown stronger.In February 2025, Hudson commemorated their four-year “meetiversary” with a post saying, “Happy Meetiversary @billbelichick — Cheers 🥂 to the fact that you still let me give you lengthy philosophical lectures four years later.” A slideshow accompanied the caption, featuring a touching photo of the couple holding hands during Super Bowl week in New Orleans.Her recent birthday post also included a stylish red beaded handbag by STAUD, inspired by the Year of the Snake—a nod to Hudson’s creative side. Fans have often seen glimpses of her DIY flair, whether it’s bedazzling a UNC sweatshirt or crafting a rhinestone lobster purse to raise awareness for Maine fishermen.While Belichick is gearing up for his new role at UNC, their life together continues to reflect a delicate balance between legacy and love. From philosophical musings to beachside antics—like the viral ""Billates"" workout where Hudson was seen balanced on Belichick’s feet—the couple is redefining what it means to navigate fame and age differences with grace, humor, and authenticity.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers left more than memories for Olivia Munn — a haunting truth she can’t shake Their story proves that sometimes, love takes off in the most unexpected places—like 30,000 feet in the air—and lands in a partnership that neither logic nor judgment can define.","Jordon Hudson celebrated her 24th birthday with a thoughtful tribute to Bill Belichick.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta updated the court that the plea could be re-heard within two weeks when the probe reaches a conclusive point.Ranveer Allahbadia, in his plea, argued that without his passport, he is unable to travel for his international shows, which is significantly affecting his livelihood. However, the court remained firm in its decision, stating that the investigation must take precedence. Similarly, Ashish Chanchlani’s plea to retrieve his passport was also rejected.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had given Ranveer go-ahead to restart his podcasts but had also asked him to uphold ""morality and decency"" in them.

NAVI MUMBAI: Nine years after police officer Ashwini Bidre -Gore went missing, Panvel sessions court on Saturday held her colleague, inspector Abhay Kurundkar , guilty of murder. Two others who helped Kurundkar in disposing of the body were also held guilty for disappearance of evidence.Kurundkar, who was in a relationship with assistant police inspector Bidre, murdered her following a dispute in April 2016, cut her body into parts, stuffed it in a trunk and sack and dumped it in Vasai creek. The remains were never found. Judge K G Paldewar will pronounce the sentence on April 11 after hearing Bidre's father and daughter on quantum of compensation. The judge expressed surprise that Kurundkar was given the President's medal for gallanty in 2017.Holding three persons guilty of murder of woman cop Ashwini Bidre-Gore, Judge K G Paldewar said, ""It is surprising that Abhay Kurundkar, who allegedly kidnapped and murdered Ashwini Bidre-Gore in April 2016, was given the President's medal for gallantry on Republic Day. Hence, the question arises as to how the committee of the police department recommended his name for the award in spite of being aware that he was an accused in a murder case. An inquiry is necessary against the errant officers.""Kurundkar did not show any remorse when the judge announced the verdict, said Raju Gore, Bidre's estranged husband. The others convicted are Kundan Bhandari, Kurundkar's driver, and Mahesh Phalnikar, a Pune bank staffer and close friend of Kurundkar. Phalnikar collapsed in court after he was held guilty.Special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat said, ""I had demanded to frame additional charge under Section 218 (public servant framing incorrect record with intent to save a person from punishment) of IPC by arguing Kurundkar had prepared a fake log book by making false entry of timings of police patrolling vehicle at Thane rural crime department, where he was senior inspector, to claim he was on patrolling duty when the alleged murder took place.""He added, ""The technical evidence using Google map tracking gathered by investigating officer ACP Sangita Shinde Alphanso helped in proving circumstantial evidence against Kurundkar as his presence was located at Vasai creek on the day he allegedly murdered API Bidre and dumped her body parts in the creek with the help of two accused. Also, as court has reprimanded errant police officers for delay in probing the murder case allegedly under political pressure, we will ensure they face disciplinary action.""Judge Paldewar said the murder falls in the rarest of rare category. The court said Bidre's father and daughter, who were not present in court, were actual victims as they have lost a daughter and mother, and wanted to decide on their compensation. They have suffered due to the lethargic attitude of police officers responsible for the delay in registering murder case a year after she went missing, he said.Advocate Vishal Bhanushali, representing Abhay Kurundkar, Bhandari and Phalnikar, said, ""As defense counsel, I had the solemn responsibility of safeguarding legal rights and ensuring the trial conformed to the highest standards of fairness and due process. This was an intensely scrutinized and emotionally charged case, involving voluminous evidence.""",Inspector Abhay Kurundkar found guilty of murder of police officer Ashwini Bidre-Gore.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 1,053.60 points, or 5.99 per cent, to 16,547.45, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 1,682.61 points, or 3.98 per cent, finishing at 40,542.71.Analysts at UBS said that legal challenges could arise soon against the White House’s use of executive authority to impose the tariffs. Trump announced the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—a law that has not been used before for such broad changes in economic policy.""Furthermore, businesses are likely to intensify lobbying efforts. And political pressure to ease tariffs could mount as economic costs rise,"" UBS said in a note.""In our base case (to which we assign a 50 per cent probability), we would expect tariffs to be reduced from the levels announced by the President. The President himself invited negotiations, and Treasury Secretary Bessent said in a Bloomberg interview that the announced tariffs are ‘the high end of the number’ and that countries could take steps to bring tariffs down,"" the note added.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg suffered the biggest loss, with his wealth dropping by $17.9 billion.

DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’

China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system, and promoting the construction of an open world economy. The Chinese government has the capability and wisdom to respond to various challenges in international trade, safeguard the interests of the nation and its people, and promote the healthy and stable development of the economy. China's development achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the concerted efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. No external factors can hinder China's progress and the improvement of its people's lives. China will continue to deepen reforms, expand openness, and work with other countries around the world to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

DeepSeek’s reply to “retaliatory actions that China can take against Trump's tariffs?""

China has a range of policy tools and strategic options to respond to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S., ensuring the protection of its national interests while maintaining stability in global trade. Possible measures include:

1. Reciprocal Tariffs on U.S. Goods

•⁠ ⁠China could impose *targeted tariffs* on key U.S. exports such as *agricultural products (soybeans, pork), aircraft, automobiles, and energy products*.

•⁠ ⁠This would pressure politically sensitive U.S. industries, influencing domestic sentiment in key electoral states.

2. Export Controls on Critical Materials

•⁠ ⁠China dominates global supply chains in *rare earth metals* (used in electronics, defense, and green tech).

•⁠ ⁠Restrictions on rare earth exports could disrupt U.S. manufacturing, similar to measures taken in past trade disputes.

3. Non-Tariff Barriers & Regulatory Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Stricter inspections* on U.S. imports (food safety, customs delays).

•⁠ ⁠*Anti-dumping & anti-subsidy investigations* against U.S. products.

•⁠ ⁠*Preferential treatment* for non-U.S. companies in government procurement.

4. Diversifying Trade Partners (Reducing U.S. Dependence)

•⁠ ⁠*Strengthening trade with the EU, ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America* through new agreements.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)* to deepen Asia-Pacific trade ties.

5. Currency & Financial Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Allowing the yuan to depreciate* to make Chinese exports more competitive.

•⁠ ⁠*Dumping U.S. Treasury bonds* (though this is a double-edged sword).

6. Legal & WTO Challenges

•⁠ ⁠*Filing complaints at the WTO* against U.S. tariffs, as done in previous trade wars.

•⁠ ⁠*Forming alliances with other affected countries* to jointly oppose U.S. protectionism.

7. Domestic Stimulus & Self-Reliance

•⁠ ⁠*Boosting domestic consumption* to offset export losses.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating tech independence* (e.g., semiconductor self-sufficiency via policies like ""Made in China 2025"").

Conclusion

China has a *strategic, multi-layered approach* to counter U.S. tariffs, combining retaliatory measures with long-term economic resilience strategies. The goal is not just short-term retaliation but also reducing dependency on the U.S. market while strengthening global alliances.

US President Donald Trump ’s recent tariff announcements have reignited concerns about a potential trade war, particularly with China. The new tariffs, imposing a 54% rate on Chinese imports, threaten to disrupt numerous sectors, with technology supply chains facing significant impact. The Trump administration justifies the tariffs as a means to safeguard American industries and rectify trade imbalances, but critics express concerns about rising consumer prices and global economic instability.We asked DeepSeek , China's biggest AI disrupter in recent times, about the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on the country, and the response was pretty neutral.When asked, “Are Tump’s reciprocal tariffs bad for China?”, DeepSeek highlighted a “mutually beneficial strategy”.On the question, “What China can do to reciprocate the reciprocal Tariffs announced by Donald Trump?”, DeepSeek replied highlighting that China possesses a diverse toolkit to counteract US tariffs, encompassing both retaliatory actions and long-term strategic adjustments aimed at protecting China's national interests and maintain global trade stability.It explained the response in 7 points. Here’s what DeepSeek said:Last year, China announced a ban on the export of key minerals to the US, a move that could significantly impact the US technology manufacturing sector. According to a Reuters report, China's export ban includes minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others.These minerals are essential components in a wide range of technologies, including semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications (e.g., ammunition, nuclear weapons). Gallium and germanium are crucial for semiconductors, while germanium also plays a role in infrared technology, fiber optic cables, and solar cells.","DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’ China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system.

(AP Photo/Jason Redmond)

Another mistake Bill Gates made as CEO of MIcrosoft

Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary this month, and co-founder Bill Gates sat down with current CEO Satya Nadella . Among all the conversations, he opened up about one critical misstep during the company's early days when Gates himself was the CEO, and that was underestimating the importance of government relations .""You know, I might tell my younger self, watch out for the government,"" Gates said during a recent podcast featuring all three CEOs who have led Microsoft throughout its half-century history. ""I was pretty naive about not engaging in Washington, DC, as soon as I should have.""This political naivety ultimately led to a massive antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, when the US Department of Justice alleged the tech giant was becoming a monopoly. The legal battle resulted in a 2000 ruling that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws, with an initial order to split the company in two—though an appeals court later overturned this decision.Gates' Washington mistake wasn't his only regret. He also acknowledged misconceptions about team building during Microsoft's formative years.""I certainly at first thought that engineering skill meant you would be good at other things. That turned out to be wrong,"" Gates admitted. ""We had to really build teams in a more mixed, diverse set of skills than I expected.""The billionaire philanthropist has previously shared advice he would give his younger self, noting in a 2017 Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session that ""smartness is not single-dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then.""Despite these early missteps, Microsoft has grown into one of the world's most valuable companies under the leadership of Gates, Steve Ballmer , and current CEO Satya Nadella . Now a tech behemoth that revolutionized personal computing, Microsoft's journey from startup to industry titan stands as a testament to its ability to learn from mistakes—including Gates' early political oversight.",Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates opened up about the company's early days.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
