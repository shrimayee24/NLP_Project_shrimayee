NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday announced that a C-130J aircraft carrying around 12 tonnes of humanitarian aid has landed in Colombo. The delivery is part of India’s Operation Sagar Bandhu, launched on Friday to assist Sri Lanka in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, which has so far claimed 80 lives.Sharing the update on X, Jaishankar wrote, “#OperationSagarBandhu unfolds. @IAF_MCC C-130J plane carrying approximately 12 tons of humanitarian aid, including tents, tarpaulins, blankets, hygiene kits, and ready-to-eat food items, lands in Colombo.”India initiated Operation Sagar Bandhu as part of its immediate response to assist cyclone-affected areas. The first relief consignments were transported by the Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and frontline warship INS Udaigiri, which arrived in Colombo on Friday and handed over supplies to Sri Lankan authorities.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, conveyed his condolences to the people of Sri Lanka, expressing grief over the lives lost in the cyclone and extending solidarity with India’s “closest maritime neighbour.” He noted that India had swiftly dispatched relief supplies and critical Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) equipment under the operation.“We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” said PM Modi, adding that the support was guided by India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR.This comes as India bids to offer help Sri Lanka has been reeling from floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah. The island nation is facing one of its most severe disasters in recent years, with widespread damage to infrastructure and rising casualties. According to PTI, more than 80 people have died as the storm unleashed heavy rains across multiple provinces.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) separately reported 61 deaths and 25 people missing, while nearly 44,000 individuals from over 12,000 families have been affected since adverse weather began on November 16.The crisis intensified as Sri Lanka’s Western Province faced warnings of an “unprecedented disaster situation” owing to rising water levels in the Kelani and Attanagalu rivers. Several districts in the Northern, North-Central, Central, North-Western, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces are expected to receive over 200 mm of rain, according to the Sri Lankan Meteorological Department. Rainfall above 150 mm is also likely in parts of Trincomalee, Badulla, Galle and Matara. The DMC reported four homes destroyed and more than 600 partially damaged in the ongoing deluge.(With inputs from agencies)","A C-130J aircraft carrying around 12 tonnes of humanitarian aid has landed in Colombo.

10 things to know about the Airbus A320 recall



Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft, a move that is expected to affect more than half of the global fleet. This large-scale recall may cause widespread disruption, especially in the United States, where it coincides with one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.

Airbus has revealed that a recent incident involving one of its A320-family aircraft has uncovered a potential risk linked to ""intense solar radiation"", which may corrupt data essential for the aircraft's flight-control systems. Following this finding, the company identified a significant number of A320 aircraft currently in service that could be affected by the issue.

Air India has acknowledged the directive, saying it is “aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in service across airline operators,” and noted that the requirement will involve a “software/hardware realignment” on part of its fleet. The airline has warned that ""longer turnaround times and delays"" are likely during the update process.

Air India recently completed a major retrofit programme for its older A320neo fleet. With 27 refurbished aircraft, 14 newly delivered A320neos, and additional planes added after the Vistara merger, the airline now operates around 104 A320-family aircraft with new or upgraded interiors.

IndiGo has also confirmed compliance with the directive, emphasising that “safety comes first” and stating that it is carrying out the updates “with full diligence and care.” The airline has indicated that some flights may see schedule changes while the work is underway.

Most of IndiGo’s A320 fleet consists of newer variants, with older models now in single digits. With over 300 A320-family planes, the airline is expected to complete updates on nearly 250 aircraft by Monday or Tuesday, according to sources. Air India, with about 120–125 A320s, is expected to finish updates on more than 100 aircraft in a similar timeframe.

Industry observers say this may be one of the largest recalls Airbus has faced in its 55-year history, as Reuters reported. The timing is notable, coming just weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered aircraft model in the world.

The repair itself is expected to be relatively simple and mainly involves reverting to a previous software version. Even so, airlines must complete the process before the planes can return to passenger service, except for repositioning flights to repair centres.

Airlines across North America, South America, Europe, India, and New Zealand have warned that the required repairs could lead to delays or cancellations. American Airlines, the largest A320 operator globally, expects to update around 340 of its 480 A320s, with each fix likely taking about two hours.

Other major airlines—such as Lufthansa, IndiGo, and easyJet—are also planning brief groundings for the updates. In South America, Avianca has said more than 70% of its fleet is affected, leading the carrier to temporarily shut ticket sales until December 8 for certain travel dates.

The recall comes at a challenging time for the aviation industry, which is already dealing with heavy workloads at repair shops, long delays for separate engine-related inspections, and labour shortages. These factors are expected to slow down the completion of repairs and add further pressure to global flight operations.

JetBlue incident leads to probe



NEW DELHI: Air travel in India and around the world is expected to face major disruptions after Europe-based Airbus issued a technical directive ordering a software upgrade for its A320 family aircraft. In India, more than 300 IndiGo and Air India A320 planes will remain grounded for the next two to three days while the update is carried out, with normal operations expected to resume by Monday or Tuesday.Globally, around 6,000 aircraft from A320 fleet are likely to be impacted. The grounding is significant because Airbus and its main rival Boeing together control over three-quarters of the world's commercial aircraft fleet, meaning any large-scale recall has an immediate and widespread impact on global air traffic.The technical directive reportedly came shortly after an incident involving a JetBlue A320 aircraft, which led to discussions among safety regulators and eventually contributed to a deeper review of the fleet’s software configuration. While details are still emerging, the episode is believed to have triggered closer scrutiny and may have played a role in Airbus deciding to issue a global advisory and recall order for immediate corrective action.","Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft.

Parliamentary panel studying ONOE bill to seek extension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliamentary-panel-studying-onoe-bill-to-seek-extension/articleshow/125649577.cms,"NEW DELHI: The parliamentary committee scrutinising the constitutional amendment bill that proposes simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections will seek an extension in its tenure from Parliament as it needs more time to gather views of different stakeholders, including national and regional political parties, the panel’s chairperson P P Chaudhary said on Friday.Its current tenure is till the first day of the last week of the coming Winter Session, which is scheduled between Dec 1 and Dec 19.“The committee needs more time,” Chaudhary told TOI, while emphasising that opinions of various constitutional experts make it clear that the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, commonly known as one-nation-one-election (ONOE) bill, is not violative of the Constitution’s basic structure, a key argument of opposition parties against the proposed law.NDA govt’s vigorous push for simultaneous polls has also received full-throttle endorsement from Law Commission. The “refreshing concept of synchronising of elections” is in larger national interest and is “squarely within the periphery of amending powers of the Parliament,” it has said, according to sources.In its written opinion to the committee, Law Commission is learnt to have said, “Far from undermining democracy, the proposed bill aims to strengthen it by ensuring stability, reducing the constant drain of elections, and allowing govts to focus on governance.”Its representatives along with those from Election Commission of India are scheduled to appear before the Chaudhary-led committee on Dec 4. It has rejected the arguments of opposition parties and some experts that the bill violates the Constitution’s basic structure and federal character.It has also backed some of the more contentious provisions of the bill, especially related to the sweeping powers given to EC under its Article 82A(5) to defer an assembly poll if the poll body thinks that it cannot be conducted simultaneously with that of Lok Sabha.Besides other experts, some former CJIs too, in their comments to the committee, have questioned the “unfettered” powers delegated to EC in the bill and suggested corrective measures, including the need for parliamentary nod in such cases.Law Commission, in its opinion, has equated EC with judiciary, executive and legislature when it comes to upholding democracy, asserting that Article 324 of the Constitution bestows on it extensive and broad powers and protects it from any external influence.","The committee's current tenure is till the first day of the last week of the coming Winter Session, which is scheduled between Dec 1 and Dec 19.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday sealed a Rs 7,995 crore deal with the US as part of a “follow-on support” package for the Navy’s fleet of 24 Seahawk helicopters for five years.The signing of the contract comes amid a strain in ties after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Indian goods in late Aug.The defence ministry said it signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs) with the US for sustainment support of the MH60R helicopter fleet . Manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation, it is an all-weather helicopter designed to support multiple missions with state of the art avionics and sensors. The LOAs were inked under the foreign military sales programme of the US.India had signed an agreement with the US for procurement of 24-MH 60Rs in Feb 2020. The MH 60R Seahawk is a maritime variant of the Blackhawk helicopter.The sustainment support is a comprehensive package that includes provisioning of spares, support equipment, product support, training and technical support, and repair and replenishment of components, according to the defence ministry.It also provides for setting up of intermediate level component repairs and periodic maintenance inspection facilities in India for the choppers. “In-country development of these facilities will ensure capability build-up in the long run and reduced dependence on the US govt, thus aligning with the vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’,” the ministry said. “This would further lead to indigenous product and services development through MSMEs & other Indian firms,” it said in a statement.","India on Friday sealed a Rs 7,995 crore deal with the US as part of a ‘follow-on support’ package for the Navy’s fleet of 24 Seahawk helicopters for five years.

Social media response:

Yet you fired a ton of people who took care of that land and want to destroy it for oil.

Sounds like another grift as you kill tourism -- great f****g work!





Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

BTW stop tracking us, we don't appreciate it. When you show your American The Beautiful Pass at the gate - they scan BOTH your pass AND your ID. That is a violation of our civil rights.





America really said “tourists pay, patriots play free” and called it progress





A row erupted after the US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access, including higher fees for nonresidents and expanded digital passes. Starting January 1, 2026, US residents will pay $80 for an Annual Pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.Nonresidents without a pass will also face a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited parks.“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”""The Department of @Interior is making it easier for AMERICANS to enjoy our National Parks: U.S. residents enjoy affordable pricing, while foreigners pay a high rate,"" the White House said in a post on X.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, ""patriotic fee-free"" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before, reported BBC .The Department has also announced a set of resident-only patriotic fee-free days for 2026. These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system. Critics have urged the Department to take a closer look at how the higher nonresident rates affect H-1B and F-1 visa holders. The new charges could disproportionately burden international visitors.","The US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access.

NEW DELHI: Air travel will get every impacted in India and across the globe with the world’s largest selling single aisle — Airbus A320 family of planes — going to be grounded this weekend for a software upgrade. In India, over 350 A320 family planes of IndiGo and Air India Group will be grounded for this upgrade that is expected to be over in 2-3 days. They are expected to resume flying by next Monday or Tuesday. Globally about 6,000 aircraft are likely to be impacted.The upgrade is in wake of an American low cost carrier JetBlue’s A320 operating from Cancun to Newark on Oct 30, 2025, “unexpectedly pitch(ing) downward without pilot input.” The uncontrolled descent “likely occurred during an ELAC (flight control computer) switch change,” according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The aircraft diverted to Tampa, where some passengers were hospitalised.Tackling this issue requires a software upgrade. For the new A320 family planes, the work requires about half an hour on each plane through “loading facility.” On older A320s, some hardware upgrade will also be required and hence the overall work will take longer.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive (EAD) for Airbus A320 family of planes which “may unfortunately cause disruption to flight schedules and inconvenience to passengers. As is always the case in aviation, safety is paramount.”In India, almost all IndiGo A320 family planes are the new variants. The older A320s are in single digits. So IndiGo, which has over 350 A320 family planes in its fleet, upgrade on the required 250 aircraft should be over by Monday or Tuesday, said sources. Air India, which has about 120-125 A320 family planes, should also have the same situation, with over 100 impacted.Air India said on X early Saturday morning: “We are aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in-service across airline operators. This will result in a software/hardware realignment on a part of our fleet, leading to longer turnaround time and delays to our scheduled operations. Air India regrets any inconvenience this may cause to passengers till the reset is carried out across the fleet. ”Airbus said in a statement: “Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Airbus has consequently identified a significant number of A320 family aircraft currently in-service which may be impacted. Airbus has worked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an alert operators transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly. This AOT will be reflected in an emergency airworthiness directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).”Airbus “acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers” and apologised “for the inconvenience caused”. The European airspace major said it “will work closely with operators, while keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.”In its emergency airworthiness directive regarding the issue, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) gave the reason for the same: “An Airbus A320 aeroplane recently experienced an uncommanded and limited pitch down event. The autopilot remained engaged throughout the event, with a brief and limited loss of altitude, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Preliminary technical assessment done by Airbus identified a malfunction of the affected ELAC as possible contributing factor. This condition, if not corrected, could lead in the worst-case scenario to an uncommanded elevator movement that may result in exceeding the aircraft’s structural capability. To address this potential unsafe condition, Airbus issued the alert operators transmission, providing instructions to install a serviceable ELAC.”","In India, over 350 A320 family planes of IndiGo and Air India Group will be grounded for this upgrade.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

India-Russia Summit Dates Out As PM Modi, Putin Review S-400, Su-57 And Global Security Challenges

NEW DELHI: In a development that will be closely followed across Western capitals, Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to India next week - on December 4-5 - for the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit, the government announced Friday. Putin is expected to arrive on December 4 in the evening and head into the summit with PM Narendra Modi the next morning.Several agreements and MoUs spanning across a range of areas are expected to be signed during the visit that will help India reassert its strategic autonomy by underscoring the defence and trade partnerships with Moscow. However, the summit will also test India’s ability to navigate a delicate situation and balance competing interests as it works to ensure that the outcomes don’t act as a deal-breaker in its ties with the US and the EU.Announcing the visit, the Indian government said in a statement that it will provide an opportunity for the leadership of India and Russia to review progress in bilateral relations, set the vision for strengthening the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.This will be Putin’s first visit to India since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Unlike the last time Putin travelled to India – in December 2021 – for the annual summit, this will be a State Visit during which President Droupadi Murmu will also host a banquet in his honour. Putin’s last visit, in the middle of a Covid wave, lasted only for a few hours. China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia are among the countries Putin has visited since the war started.While the visit allows both sides to reinforce the importance they attach to the relationship, which is defined by longstanding trust, India will be mindful of how the outcomes, especially in defence and energy, are seen in Washington and European capitals. India is looking to conclude negotiations in the next few weeks for a bilateral trade agreement with the US, which has imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its oil purchase from Russia, and of immediate priority also is the EU-India summit that New Delhi will host in January.The EU summit is expected to yield several significant takeaways including an FTA and an ambitious defence and security partnership. It’s important for India to not allow the summit with Russia to indicate – not at this moment anyway - that its ties with Moscow far outweigh its relations with other important partners with whom it’s looking to boost, among other things, trade and defence industrial cooperation.In the meeting, India is likely to seek ways to address the increasing trade deficit with Russia and discuss a proposal to acquire 5 more squadrons of S-400 air defence systems.

Only US and China are ahead of India on the list.The 2025 edition shows India's overall power score crossing 40 points, the threshold for classification as a 'major power'. The US and China scored 80.5 and 73.7 points, respectively, and Japan ranks fourth with 38.8 points. However, there are still gaps between India's ambition and the reality of continued limits on its influence, particularly relative to China, the institute said.The annual Asia Power Index measures resources and influence to rank relative power of states. India was among middle powers in the Asia Power Index-2024 with a comprehensive power score of 38.1.India ranks third for two measures - economic capability and future resources. It increased its economic capability rank by one place to third, overtaking Japan. Increases in its inward investment have seen India rise to ninth place in economic relationships.The Lowy Institute said India's economic and military capabilities have both increased in the 2025 edition. It said India's economy has continued to grow strongly and made small gains in terms of its geopolitical relevance.","India has secured the third position in the Asia Power Index 2025.

No Indian metro had ‘safe’ air in past 10 years: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-indian-metro-had-safe-air-in-past-10-yrs-study/articleshow/125643655.cms,"Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

MUMBAI: No major Indian city has ""good"" air quality. A 10-year assessment of air pollution across major urban centres has found that none of the country's top cities met safe Air Quality Index (AQI) levels at any point between 2015 and Nov 2025.The report, prepared by Climate Trends, an environmental research firm, analysed long-term pollution patterns across 11 major cities. Delhi remained India's most polluted city throughout the period of study, with average AQI levels peaking above 250 in 2016 and hovering around 180 this year.Despite marginal dips after 2019, the national capital never approached healthy air-quality thresholds. Vehicular emissions, industrial pollution and crop burning were major contributors, compounded by the region's geographical constraints.Cities such as Lucknow, Varanasi and Ahmedabad which recorded persistently high average AQI values — often above 200— in first half of the decade, showed some improvement in the second half. While southern and western cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Bengaluru recorded relatively moderate AQI levels, even they did not meet safe thresholds. Bengaluru posted lowest AQI readings in the country — between 65 and 90 — still too high for ""good"" category.AQI is based on the concentration of toxic particulate matter, PM2.5 or PM10, in the air, whichever is higher.Geography plays a significant role in prolonging pollution episodes, especially across the northern plains. ""With cold north-westerly winds sweeping into the plains, minimum temperatures are set to drop further — making it even harder for pollutants to disperse,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet Weather.He added that this year's weak western disturbances — extratropical storms that bring winter rain and snow to northwestern India — were inadequate and failed to trigger widespread rainfall.""Without rain to wash pollutants out of the atmosphere, the pollution lingers for longer periods, leading to early and persistent smog-like conditions,"" said Palawat.During the cold winters of the Indo-Gangetic plains, the phenomenon of ""temperature inversion"" — which limits vertical air movement — effectively traps pollution in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Dense city structures and tall buildings further slow wind speeds, exacerbating stagnation.Experts stressed the need for better planning and data-driven interventions. ""Technology can help address many local pollution sources within your own airshed, but this requires reliable data,"" said Prof S N Tripathi of IIT-Kanpur. Palak Balyan, research lead at Climate Trends said, ""What India needs is sustained, long-term, science-based policy reform backed by genuine political will to take tough decisions. ""","A 10-year assessment of air pollution across major urban centres has found that none of the country's top cities met safe Air Quality Index levels.

Senior advocate Shashi Kiran and lawyer Sadhana Sandhu, appearing for the organisation told the court that various agencies including WHO, UN agencies and human-rights bodies have repeatedly called for states to prevent, criminalise and eliminate FGM as medical evidence showed that short-term and long-term physical and psychological harms are caused due to it.""It is further submitted that there is not any independent law specifically banning this.

Untold Bravery in Operation Sindoor: CISF Reveals It Foiled Pakistan Attack on Uri Hydro Power Plant

NEW DELHI: India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, gaining the status of 'major power.' India secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor The first two ranks of 'superpowers' were retained by the United States and China, respectively.In 2024, India was ranked among the 'middle powers,' with a comprehensive score of 38.1, whereas in this year's reports, India scored 40 out of 100. It stands ahead of Japan and Russia, which hold the fourth and fifth positions, scoring 38.8 and 32.1, respectively. However, the nation still sees a large aspirational gap as compared to China, which has 73.7 points on the index. The US topped the rankings with 80.5 points.As per the detailed assessments, India's rank is backed by its growth in terms of economic and military capabilities. Notably, India rose to ninth place in economic relationships, driven by increases in inward investment.The Lowy Institute said the modest advances in India’s geopolitical relevance were measured through international connectivity, leverage, and technological development.It also highlighted India's military capabilities to have grown steadily.""For the most part, these gains were from improved expert appraisals of its capability, which were likely influenced by India's performance in Operation Sindoor, launched in May 2025, which added to India's recent combat experience,"" the institute said.India saw its sharpest decline in terms of defence networks, dropping its rank to 11th position. It dropped two ranks lower as compared to the 2024 rankings, which were overtaken by the Philippines and Thailand.According to the index, India overtook China as the country attracting the most inward investment after the United States, an indicator capturing 10-year cumulative flows.Overall, the institute concludes that India’s recent military experience and economic momentum have strengthened its regional standing, even as challenges persist in building defence partnerships.The Australia-based think tank study assesses a nation's ability to influence its external environment among the power states in Asia.","India has secured third rank in the Asia Power Index, gaining the status of'major power' India secured this ranking in the Lowy Institute study based on its performance in Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: India believes in peace and dialogue, but it does not “compromise” when it comes to the sovereignty and security of the nation, defence minister Rajnath Singh said here on Friday.Speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue, Rajnath said, “India's economic growth, technological capabilities and principled foreign policy have made it a voice of balance and responsibility in the changing global environment, with countries across the Indo-Pacific and the Global South viewing us as a reliable partner. ”Emphasizing that a stable India contributes to a stable global economy. the minister said that through Atmanirbharta, the Centre is building a defence industrial ecosystem that encourages innovation, supports industry and reduces external dependencies. He asserted that India is shaping global discussions with a sense of responsibility, strategic autonomy, and confidence rooted in civilisational values.India has earned global trust due to path-breaking reforms, and its consistent stand for respect of the sovereignty of nations and rules-based order, he said. ""We are strengthening border and maritime infrastructure to support security and connectivity. We are modernising our forces through new platforms, technologies, and structures,"" the minister said.“We are reforming procurement processes to ensure speed, transparency, and accountability,” the minister said, adding India is investing in start-ups, “deep-tech capabilities, and research and development that will shape the battlefields of the future,"" Singh said.He emphasised that the geopolitical uncertainty and challenges such as terrorism, cross-border support to extremist elements, attempts to alter the status quo, maritime pressures, and even information warfare require constant vigilance & clarity of purpose, with reforms becoming a strategic necessity more than a choice. “Reforms strengthen the adaptability of institutions, enhance the agility of the armed forces, and give the nation the confidence to shape its own destiny,” he said, while enumerating the steps taken by the Modi govt to build a ‘Sashakt, Surakshit and Viksit Bharat’.Singh said the contribution of the armed forces goes far beyond defending the borders. “Our armed forces bring stability where it is needed most. They support civil authorities in times of disaster. They safeguard our maritime interests. They strengthen our international partnerships through joint exercises and peacekeeping. Their professionalism builds confidence — not only within India, but also among our friends around the world. That’s why reform and modernisation in the armed forces are not just administrative tasks; they are investments in India’s long-term future,” he said.The minister added that the contribution of the armed forces goes far beyond defending the borders. “Our armed forces bring stability where it is needed most.

The CDS cited ‘Operation Sindoor” as an example, demonstrating how modern weapons can target an adversary's entire natural, network, economic, and information spaces. He emphasised that these trends will continue to shape the future of warfare.

The bench directed the SEC to initiate the election process for these three categories of local bodies, which include the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. The SEC said it would soon announce the election schedule for these local bodies.SEC also informed the court that of the 246 municipal councils and 42 nagar panchayats, where polling is scheduled for Dec 2, the total reservation exceeded the 50% ceiling in 57 of them - 40 in municipal councils and 17 in nagar panchayats. The bench said till it decided the petitions, reservation cannot exceed 50% in any of the civic bodies.Directing the SEC to hold the Dec 2 polls as scheduled, it said results of the 57 local bodies, where reservation exceeds 50%, would be subject to the outcome of pending petitions. It fixed the final hearing on these petitions on Jan 21.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioners, repeatedly stressed that the total reservation, including OBC, cannot exceed the 50% ceiling fixed by constitution benches of SC. He said in local body territory where SC and ST population exceeded 50%, proportionate quota for them can exceed 50%, with no reservation for OBCs. Senior advocate Indira Jaising contested this stand, saying this would deprive backward classes of quota and result in absence of their representation in the civic bodies.The elections could not be conducted in the civic bodies because of a status quo order passed by SC in Aug 2022 on petitions challenging the state govt's ordinance, which based on the Banthia Commission recommendations had provided for 27% OBC reservation in local bodies.Giving 27% quota to OBCs in all civic bodies, the petitions said, would breach the 50% ceiling on reservation in certain areas where SC and ST constitute a majority, warranting assigning of quota over and above the standard 15% and 7.5% reservation for them respectively, and correspondingly the OBC quota would shrink to keep the total quota within the 50% limit.On May 6, SC had asked the SEC to complete by Sept 30 the elections for local bodies following the OBC reservation criteria as existed prior to the Banthia Commission's report in July 2022.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit Jordan and Oman in mid-December amidst ongoing efforts by West Asian countries to uphold the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. While this would be Modi’s second visit to Oman, which is among the countries that India is expected to soon sign a free trade agreement with, the only time he visited Jordan earlier was in 2018 when he transited through the country on his way to Ramallah, becoming the first Indian PM to visit Palestine.Modi had last visited Oman in 2018. India and Oman have concluded negotiations for a free trade deal but a formal signing of the agreement is still awaited. If Oman authorities are able to complete all domestic formalities in the next few weeks, the agreement could become the highlight of Modi’s visit.The Gaza issue is likely to figure prominently in Modi’s engagements with both King Abdullah II of Jordan and Oman Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, who had visited India in 2023. With a large diaspora and considerable energy and connectivity interests in the region, India has been consistent in its support for efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, including the Trump peace plan, ensure release of hostages and return to dialogue and diplomacy. India also sees Trump's peace plan as in line with its long-standing support for a negotiated two-State solution.Both countries earlier this year strongly condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack with the Jordanian king expressing condolences and seeking an end to terrorism in all its forms and manifestation in a phone call with Modi.Apart from efforts to boost trade and investment, talks in Amman could also focus on IMEC with Jordan looking to act as a key transit country for the Corridor.

Amit Shah Says BSF Crushed 118 Pak Posts, He Issues Tough Security Message From Sindoor Van In Kutch

NEW DELHI: Stating that the Narendra Modi govt has provided permanent solutions to the three hotspots that had become a festering wound for the nation — Left-wing extremism-hit areas, insurgency-affected North-East, and terror-hit Jammu & Kashmir — home minister Amit Shah on Friday told the police heads from across the country that these regions will “very soon” become like the rest of the country.Addressing the 60th all-India DGP/IGP conference in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, Shah said the security forces and the police are delivering strong blows to extremism, radicalisation and narcotics by focusing on three key aspects: accuracy of intelligence, clarity of objectives, and synergy in action. “We must launch a 360-degree attack on narcotics and organised crime and build such a system that drug traffickers and criminals do not get even an inch of space in this country,” he said. The time has come, he added, for state police forces to work in coordination with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and strike hard at narcotics gangs operating at state, national and international levels, and put their masterminds behind bars.Shah said that the DGP/IGP conference has, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emerged as a key forum for resolving the country’s internal security challenges – ranging from identifying problems and challenges to formulating strategies and policies.Referring to the actionable steps taken by the Modi govt for the complete elimination of Naxalism, the home minister noted that 586 fortified police stations had been constructed in Maoist-infested areas, strengthening the security grid. As a result, he said, the number of Naxal-affected districts has come down from 126 in 2014 to just 11 now.“The country will be completely free from the menace of Naxalism before the next DGP/IGP conference,” he announced.Highlighting the concrete steps taken by the Modi govt to bolster national security, Shah recounted the additional powers and mandate given to NIA, including to probe terror crimes against Indian citizens abroad, tightening the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), enactment of three new criminal laws and stronger laws against narcotics and fugitive offenders. He further said that once the three new criminal laws are fully implemented, policing in India will become the most modern in the world.Referring to the stern action taken against terrorism and extremism, Shah said that after the Centre banned the Popular Front of India (PFI), nationwide raids were conducted on their hideouts and arrests were made, “which is an outstanding example of Centre-State coordination”.","Home minister Amit Shah on Friday told the police heads from across the country that these regions will ‘very soon’ become like the rest of the country.

JAMMU: Security forces launched a joint cordon-and-search operation in the upper reaches of Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district following information about the alleged movement of three terror suspects in the region.Officials said the joint team — comprising Army, J&K Police, and CRPF personnel — was combing the densely forested Chigla-Balotha area, acting on reports about the suspects having fled into the woods. Drones and sniffer dogs had been roped in to assist the troops on the ground, fortify the cordon, and plug possible escape routes.Basantgarh falls on a traditional infiltration route used by Pakistani terrorists, who cross the international border in Kathua and move through the higher reaches towards Doda and Kishtwar districts in Jammu Division, before proceeding to Kashmir Valley. The Kathua-Udhampur-Doda-Kishtwar belt has witnessed multiple encounters and terror strikes in the past.Last month, a massive joint cordon-and-search operation was initiated in Udhampur’s Latti area after locals reported that a group of terror suspects had allegedly entered a house in Kirchi village, threatened its residents, and fled after snatching cash on Oct 17.",Security forces launched a joint cordon-and-search operation in the upper reaches of Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district.

Scepticism over opening nuclear sector to private players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scepticism-over-opening-nuclear-sector-to-private-players/articleshow/125644861.cms,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: PM Narendra Modi’s Thursday announcement about govt moving towards opening up nuclear sector to private players has been welcomed, though with a fair degree of scepticism.According to Modi, privatisation would help in development of small modular reactors (SMRs), advanced reactors and innovation. “This reform will give new strength to India’s energy security and technological leadership.”However, Atomic Energy Commission member Ravi B Grover told TOI Friday, “They (SMRs) are yet to be developed and it is premature to bet on them. With regard to SMRs, we are near peak of expectations. It is better to go for 220MW pressurised heavy water reactors rather than reactors whose technology is not yet established and whose economic viability remains unproven.”Anil Kumar Anand, former director of BARC’s reactor research group, who headed the nuclear submarine project, expressed an equal degree of scepticism. “Opening up nuclear field to private sector requires a lot of resources and money. For industries, to design and develop SMRs will be a challenge.”Anand added govt had set an ambitious target of 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. This means raising proportion of nuclear power from 2% to 9% in two decades.Another ex-official from nuclear sector who declined to be identified said if privatisation plan took off, it might require a revamp of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, which mainly scrutinises safety standards at reactors.He added new private reactors should fall under ambit of the Indo-US nuclear deal, the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group waiver and India-specific safeguards agreement.","PM Narendra Modi said privatisation would help in development of small modular reactors (SMRs) Atomic Energy Commission member Ravi B Grover said SMRs are yet to be developed and it is premature to bet on them.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","PM Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus.

'Spur Of The Moment’: Former CJI Gavai Reacts To Shoe-Attack Attempt, Reveals Why He Took No Action

SC: Issue is social media content that goes viral before pull-down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday told the information and broadcasting ministry to prepare a draft mechanism for screening of user-generated content (UGC) prior to its uploading on social media, realising its vast potential to cause social upheaval before being taken down.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Right to freedom of speech is very important but a regulated right. It is not absolute as the First Amendment Rights in the US. Self-regulatory codes may not work in case of UGC. If anti-national content is uploaded on social media, by the time the govt notices it and orders its takedown, a day or two may pass, during which period it would go viral and cause damage to, or unrest in, society. ”The bench said, “We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech. We are on a reasonable preventive mechanism, not to throttle but sieve content on social media prior to uploading. AI provides enormous potential to curate content. Some content may be academic yet... scurrilous. Today there is a statutory vacuum in this regard which needs to be filled.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan protested use of the word “anti-national” and said it is subjectively and selectively defined by authorities.The SC bench said, “Forget the definition of anti-national. If someone posts a video claiming parts of India with a neighbouring country, will it not be termed anti-national?”Bhushan differed. He asked, “If I question the accession of Sikkim to India, it is a mere viewpoint and cannot be termed anti-national.If I discuss China claiming parts of India’s territory, would it be anti-national?” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta protested loudly & said Bhushan should not instigate secession in a judicial proceeding related to curbing uploading of obscene, perverse & anti-national content on social media.CJI Kant said, “There was a case before us during Operation Sindoor. A person uploaded a video claiming he was with Pakistan and praised another country for helping Pakistan. When the matter came before the court, he simply said he had deleted the post within an hour of posting it. But in this age, the moment such content gets posted on social media, it immediately goes viral and there is no mechanism to prevent uploading of such content. ”“Right to free speech must be given the widest width. But in the case of content on social media, prosecution is a post-occurrence proceeding. There should be preventive mechanisms to stop spreading misinformation and damage to society,” the bench said.When two associations of broadcasters, OTTs and digital channels said they have self-regulatory codes and that there is no need for pre-censorship of content, the bench asked, “If the self-regulatory code is working, why is such content getting posted on social media?”“A portal under self-regulation cannot decide whether content is damaging to society, obscene or outrageous. We can’t also give that regulatory power to the govt, but to an autonomous body. Speaking against the govt is not anti-national activity. That is a precious democratic right. But the problem is with certain content on social media which goes viral prior to these being taken down,” the bench said.The court asked the I&B ministry to frame guidelines in four weeks and then publicise them to seek suggestions and objections from the public. The bench said the court would examine the issue after the govt prepares the draft mechanism, after considering the suggestions and objections of experts and public, to scrutinise social media content prior to their uploading.Attorney general R Venkaratamani and Mehta told the court that the ministry would carry out the exercise and take public opinion on it within four weeks. The bench said that the govt should take help of domain experts, jurists and media personnel in drafting the proposed mechanism.","The court asked the I&B ministry to frame guidelines in four weeks and then publicise them to seek suggestions and objections from public. ‘We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech.

Sonu Sood Questioned For Nearly Seven Hours By ED In Betting App PMLA Case

NEW DELHI: A probe into illegal betting-linked money laundering has led the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to a bike-taxi driver in Delhi, whose bank account saw unexplained deposits of Rs 331.36 crore over eight months.Officials said the agency stumbled upon the Rapido driver while tracking transactions connected to the 1xBet betting network. The deposits — made between August 19, 2024, and April 16, 2025 — triggered suspicion and prompted ED to raid the address tied to the account, according to news agency PTI.What they found was far from the profile of someone moving multi-crore sums. The driver lived in a two-room shanty in a modest locality and spent most of his day on the roads, earning just enough to run his household. During questioning, he claimed he had no knowledge of the deposits or the beneficiaries.The agency suspects the account was used as a “mule” — a bank account operated by money-laundering networks using fake or rented KYC details to channel illegal funds.What caught investigators’ attention further was that over Rs 1 crore from the same account was used to settle bills for a luxury destination wedding in Udaipur. The event is linked to a young Gujarat politician, who may soon be summoned for questioning, officials said.ED has found that the driver’s account received money from multiple unidentified sources and the funds were swiftly transferred to other suspicious accounts. One of the fund sources has been traced to illegal betting.The agency is now verifying the entire chain of sources and recipients.ED has recently attached assets worth crores belonging to former cricketers Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in the 1xBet case and has questioned several celebrities as part of its ongoing crackdown.","Bike-taxi driver's bank account saw unexplained deposits of Rs 331.36 crore over eight months.

Gemini 3 boosts Google’s market value





Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Years of hard work





Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Saturday morning, with the city recording an average AQI of 341, according to the Air Quality Early Warning System. This came a day after a slight improvement, when the AQI dropped by 28 points to 369.Residents have spent nearly half of November under hazardous smog, with pollution levels fluctuating between ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’. The lifting of curbs under the Graded Action Response Plan (GRAP 3) has brought little relief, and several parts of the city continue to struggle with breathing difficulties.India Gate and Kartavya Path were again covered in thick smog early on Saturday, recording an AQI of 346. Smog also persisted across Anand Vihar and Dhaula Kuan as morning walkers moved about cautiously.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that Alipur (319), Anand Vihar (354), and Aya Nagar (324) stayed in the ‘very poor’ category, with PM2.5 remaining the dominant pollutant. Industrial areas recorded even higher levels, with Bawana (364), Narela (387), and Okhla Phase 2 (340) reporting elevated AQI values.The area around Indira Gandhi International Airport showed comparatively better air quality, falling into the ‘poor’ category at 295.Locals expressed growing concern about the health impact. Some reported eye irritation and breathing discomfort, while a few also mentioned worries about airborne volcanic ash potentially drifting from Ethiopia.“Nothing can be seen around here. Today I didn’t wear the mask, thinking I could do it, but as soon as I came out, I felt it: my eyes were getting irritated, so I put the mask back on and got out. It is very difficult to live here,” Atul, a cyclist at Kartavya Path, told ANI. He added that government efforts seem visible “on social media” but not significantly on the ground.Another resident, Bhavya Bansal, said the government seemed to be taking steps to manage pollution, and also voiced concern that ash from the volcanic eruption abroad could worsen conditions. “Pollution is there, but if we see that the government is also working, we could see the work being done. But it seems that from the volcano which has erupted, its ashes could make (air quality) worse,” he told ANI.He added that breathing felt more difficult in Delhi compared to other cities he visits, although he was not currently facing health issues.Four days earlier, the Commission for Air Quality had withdrawn GRAP 3 measures after signs of improvement, reinstating GRAP 2 rules across the NCR. However, pollution levels have remained stubbornly high.Delhi CM Rekha Gupta reiterated the administration’s commitment to tackling the crisis. “The government is monitoring the situation daily and taking appropriate steps regularly to curb pollution. The steps we take today will give results in the future,” she said on Friday.Meanwhile, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said that ash clouds from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi volcano were unlikely to have an “immediate impact” on Delhi’s AQI, although the effects could be felt in the Himalayas, the Tarai belt, and neighbouring regions.With the winter session of Parliament beginning on December 1, the issue has resurfaced politically. Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi has called for a discussion on the crisis, criticising the Centre in an X post.“Every mother I meet tells me the same thing: her child is growing up breathing toxic air. They are exhausted, scared and angry. Modi ji, India’s children are choking in front of us. How can you stay silent?

"In BJP bastion Mulund, residents question 'vikas' amid civic decline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/in-bjp-bastion-mulund-residents-question-vikas-amid-civic-decline/articleshow/125650542.cms,"Mulund, one of Mumbai's earliest planned suburbs with its 1922 Crown & Carter gridiron layout, is today struggling with a widening gap between rapid redevelopment and sluggish civic upgrades. T ward, covering Mulund West and East, faces mounting complaints from residents and activists who say basic infrastructure has failed to keep pace with the construction boom.Politically, Mulund has long been viewed as a BJP bastion. The party swept all six municipal seats in the 2017 BMC polls. In the 2024 Lok Sabha election, BJP's Mihir Kotecha lost the constituency but still secured over 60,000 more votes than his Shiv Sena (UBT) rival within Mulund. He went on to win the assembly seat for the second time last year with a decisive margin of around 90,000 votes. The suburb's sizeable Gujarati and Rajasthani voter base traditionally turns out in large numbers for the party.But activists say BJP's 'vikas' narrative contrasts sharply with everyday civic conditions. Prakash Padikkal of Hillside Residents' Welfare Association (HIRWA) said the strain on Mulund's infrastructure is evident.""Despite long-standing plans to widen Mulund Colony Road, no progress has been made, even as the population continues to grow. The construction of 4,000 new flats in the Mulund hills has raised concerns about whether existing amenities can cope with the added load,"" he said, criticising BMC for halting road improvement work midway, leaving stretches dug up for concreting and causing daily inconvenience to motorists and pedestrians.He also flagged problems with a newly built garden in Mulund (West), which he said lacks basic security and maintenance and has turned into a hotspot for illicit activities. ""Water shortages and inadequate sanitation further exacerbate the situation, with some areas still reliant on water tankers and sewage being improperly managed,"" he said. Civic activist Bharat Soni echoed these concerns, especially over the narrow approach roads leading to new housing projects and rising air and noise pollution. He warned that using large portions of saltpan land in Mulund (East) for Dharavi rehabilitation could heighten flooding risks, as these lands historically aided natural drainage. ""Then again, the incomplete Metro 4 project, which is not connected to any railway station, offers no relief to residents who depend on trains for commuting,"" he said. ""Not to speak of the shortage of playgrounds and unfinished concreting work, which has worsened traffic.""Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha pointed to upcoming initiatives that could offer some relief. He said three new gardens and a bird park had been inaugurated recently, and a connector road at Mhada, Mulund (East), had reduced travel time and eased congestion. ""A new 428-bed municipal hospital is also set to open in Dec, providing much-needed health facilities,"" he said, acknowledging that garbage accumulation and inadequate waste management continue to pose health hazards. ""Four left-turn ramps planned on Goregaon-Mulund Link Road are expected to ease congestion at the Eastern Express Highway-Airoli junction within eight months. A road in the Development Plan linking LBS Marg to Raja Industrial Estate (Sarvodaya Nagar Road) would also reduce traffic at Sonapur junction.""Former corporator Sunil Gangwani stressed the need to reopen the revamped MT Agrawal Hospital, which has remained shut for 12 years, compelling residents to travel long distances for medical care. He criticised BMC for failing to improve public health services, the deteriorating condition of roads, the spread of slums and the persistence of hawkers encroaching on footpaths. Gangwani also flagged inadequate garbage collection and serious sewage issues worsened by increased FSI due to redevelopment.""Mulund is grappling with a range of civic issues, from inadequate infrastructure and sanitation to water shortage in hilly areas which depend largely on tankers,"" a civic activist said. ""Urgent, coordinated action from BMC and elected representatives is essential to restore quality of life in this once well-planned suburb.""","Mulund, one of Mumbai's earliest planned suburbs, is struggling with a widening gap between rapid redevelopment and sluggish civic upgrades.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Chinese government issues warning on the industry that Elon Musk had said worries him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-government-issues-warning-on-the-industry-that-elon-musk-had-said-worries-him/articleshow/125650524.cms,"China's top economic agency has issued a rare warning about potential bubbles in its rapidly growing humanoid robotics industry. Over 150 companies are producing similar robots, raising concerns about genuine research and development. This mirrors past investment frenzies. China aims to produce over 10,000 humanoid robots this year, more than half globally. Beijing plans to accelerate market mechanisms and promote consolidation to ensure fair competition and real-world applications.

Musk's prediction about Chinese dominance may be coming true

China's robot revolution accelerates despite growing pains





China's top economic planning agency has issued a rare warning about bubble risks in the country's rapidly expanding humanoid robotics sector—the same industry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously expressed concern about China potentially dominating.The National Development and Reform Commission of China cautioned about the proliferation of remarkably similar robots from more than 150 companies flooding the market, according to Bloomberg. Agency spokeswoman Li Chao told reporters the country must prevent this deluge from overwhelming the sector and crowding out genuine research and development efforts.The warning reflects Beijing's growing unease over excessive investment pouring into humanoid robotics, which officials have designated as one of six key economic growth drivers through 2030. This pattern echoes previous investment frenzies in sectors ranging from bike-sharing to semiconductors that ended in industry shakeouts eliminating smaller players.The Tesla billionaire warned during an April conference call that while he believes his Optimus robots lead in performance, China might ultimately dominate the field. ""I'm a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks 2 through 10 will be Chinese companies,"" Musk said, as reported by Bloomberg.His concerns appear well-founded. China is on track to produce more than 10,000 humanoid robots this year—representing over half of global production, according to research from Chinese think tank Leaderobot. The country announced earlier this year it would invest 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) in robotics and high technology over the next two decades, dwarfing investments from the US or Europe.Investment in the sector exploded after Unitree's dancing robots captivated audiences during this year's Spring Festival Gala. Since then, Chinese humanoid robots have dominated social media performing tasks from running marathons to kickboxing and making coffee.The market's potential remains massive. Citigroup projects the humanoid robotics market and related services could reach $7 trillion by 2050, with 648 million human-like robots potentially populating the world.Chinese startups including EngineAI, Unitree, AgiBot and Galbot are harnessing artificial intelligence to help robots learn new tasks independently. The Solactive China Humanoid Robotics Index has surged nearly 30% this year as investor enthusiasm builds.Beijing plans to accelerate development of mechanisms for market entry and exit while promoting consolidation of technology and industrial resources across the sector to support fair competition and real-world applications.","China's top economic planning agency has issued a rare warning about bubble risks in the country's rapidly expanding humanoid robotics sector.

'Zero Americans are named Raja Krishnamoorthi'





Indian-origin Democratic Congressman (Illinois) Raja Krishnamoorthi was criticized for reintroducing an Act that he proposed earlier to increase the number of H-1B visas available each year. The move was called 'vicious' and 'tone-deaf' on social media as the administration is dealing with a major H-1B controversy after President Donald Trump said America needs certain talents but MAGA doesn't agree.The High-Skilled Immigration Reform for Employment (HIRE) Act proposes to increase the number of available H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000. The proposal says this would ensure US employers, including those in critical and emerging technology sectors, can recruit the specialized talent needed to fill persistent workforce shortages.To shield itself from criticism, the bill also directs new funding to strengthen STEM programs in US schools.“To build the jobs and industries of tomorrow, America must stay at the forefront of innovation by strengthening our own workforce while continuing to welcome top talent from around the globe,” Krishnamoorthi said. “The HIRE Act advances both goals by boosting STEM education in our elementary and secondary schools and by expanding the annual supply of H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000.By growing our domestic talent pipeline and ensuring employers can recruit the skilled workers they need, we can create good-paying jobs and secure America’s leadership in the technologies of the future. ”Social media users called for Krishnamoorthi's deportation as they claimed that he should not be in Congress if he is serving India.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) Ahmad said Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"
