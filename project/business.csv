Uniform opportunity to become district judges: SC reserves verdict; direct recruits oppose quota for promotional cadre judicial officers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uniform-opportunity-to-become-district-judges-sc-reserves-verdict-direct-recruits-oppose-quota-for-promotional-cadre-judicial-officers/articleshow/125100301.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved a verdict on an issue sensitive to 20,000-odd judicial officers and will decide whether those opting for the promotional route to become district judges need a quota to counter lawyers, directly recruited to the DJ post, from stealing a march over them.While the High Courts have cited constitutional mandate to request the SC to refrain from interfering in the framing of service and promotion rules and conditions, the promotional cadre of judicial officers pitched for a quota complaining that those who start their careers as judicial magistrates seldom reach the post of Principal District Judge (PDJ).The promotional cadre also told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai, CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices Vikram Nath, K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi that while a 35-year-old lawyer with seven years practice can clear a competitive examination to become district judge, the career judicial officers become district judges at an age that varies between 45-52 years in different states.But the direct recruit district judge cadre officers through several senior advocates said that there are three sources of filling DJ posts – promotion (50% of posts), direct recruitment (25%) and through limited departmental competitive examination (25%). The promotional cadre officers outnumber the directly recruited DJs by three to one and the existing ROTA-Quota system has worked well and does not need tweaking by introducing quota for promotional cadre, they said.CJI Gavai said, “In some states direct recruit DJs are in an advantageous position, while promotional cadres enjoy advantage in some other states. SO, is it not necessary that there should be a uniform promotional avenue for judicial officers to DJ post irrespective of their source of recruitment?”When some counsel apprehended that tweaking the system would fuel the existing rivalry between promotional cadre and direct recruits, the bench said, “We are only examining the issue of giving a fair opportunity to each judicial officer irrespective of their source of recruitment. The intention is to improve the efficiency of the justice delivery system.”A counsel pointed out that not even one among the present 34 SC judges have come from the promotional cadre of judicial officers, the CJI-led bench said there have been many instances in the past when judicial officers through promotion to DJ, got selected as HC Judges and then elevated as SC judges, including two CJIs.“We do not perceive it as a fight between promotional cadres and direct recruit judicial officers. This exercise is for improving the efficiency of the system of administration of justice. It is a trial-and-error method. The mechanism had been tweaked in the past. Whatever we may decide in this case may be revisited by the SC a few years later,” the bench said.",The High Courts have cited constitutional mandate to request the SC to refrain from interfering in the framing of service and promotion rules and conditions.

Attempts to revolutionise travel by road discernible says SC; focus on infra development seen a quantum leap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attempts-to-revolutionise-travel-by-road-discernible-says-sc-focus-on-infra-development-seen-a-quantum-leap/articleshow/125100066.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what could make the Union govt, especially road transport and highway minister Nitin Gadkari, proud, the Supreme Court on Tuesday commended the country’s quantum leap in infrastructure development and digitisation and said attempts to revolutionise travel by road through world-class highways are discernible.While frowning at the inability of the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh state road transport corporations to reach an agreement on inter-state bus routes causing discomfort to people, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih said India has developed in this century as an intricate network of highways connect remote villages to the cities and towns.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, “Expressways have been constructed to facilitate faster movement of people and goods between distant locations and thereby reduce travel time. These highways and expressways are transforming India’s transportation landscape and driving economic growth, among others.”What could remind old-timers about then Lok Sabha member Lalu Prasad Yadav’s infamous statement promising to construct highways as smooth as an actor’s cheek, the bench said, “What deserves special note is that the surface of these highways/expressways is smoother than ever before.With the introduction of modern vehicles, operators of stage carriage services have been providing comfort and convenience which are comparable with services available abroad. ”“Switch to electric vehicles for both public and private use has facilitated sustainable transportation. A feature of smart transportation has been integration of technology to enhance efficiency and safety. In fine, with continued innovation and investment, the road transport sector seems to have progressed to attain more efficiency, sustainability and accessibility,” it said.SC said digitisation has been a game-changer and a couple of state road transport corporations have made use of all these IT and infrastructure developments to earn profits. “To adapt to the changing transportation landscape, leveraging technology to improve services and customer experience is the priority for these corporations,” it said.After the praise for the infrastructure development, the SC said the SRTCs of UP and MP have not paid adequate heed to interest of passengers and commuters and asked the two state-run bodies to enter dialogue for commencing playing of buses on inter-state routes.The SC said the principal secretaries of the transport departments of the two states could meet and work out an Inter-State Reciprocal Transport Agreement within three months to enable private operators to ply buses on routes allotted to MPSRTC, which is on the verge of being wound up.",Supreme Court commended the country’s quantum leap in infrastructure development and digitisation.

Watch: Pappu Yadav Gets Angry When Asked Why He Wasn’t Seen with Rahul Gandhi

AURANGABAD: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi stirred controversy Tuesday by claiming ""10% of the country's population"" controls the Army, comments seen as an allusion to upper castes. ""...Only 10% of the country's population get opportunities in corporate sectors, bureaucracy, and judiciary. .. even the Army is under their control. The remaining 90% - backward classes, Dalits, STs, and minorities - are nowhere to be seen,"" Rahul said while campaigning in Bihar's Aurangabad and Kutumba ahead of the first phase of assembly polls on Thursday.The comments echoed calls by Congress's Rahul and other opposition parties over the past year for a national caste census but this was the first time he had referred to the Army while highlighting such demands.Rahul asserted that such a census would identify ""the 90% Indians sitting outside the system"" and help protect their rights and constitutional guarantees. ""If 90% people don't have participatory rights, the Constitution can't be protected. We want the data. How many Dalits, OBCs, women, minorities... are there. We are trying to protect the Constitution through this demand for a caste census,"" Rahul said.Rahul has made controversial comments about the Army earlier, drawing legal censure.He was rapped by Supreme Court in Aug for claiming during his 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' over two years ago that ""Chinese troops are thrashing Indian soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh"". The comment was made in reference to the face-off with China in Arunachal's Tawang in Dec 2022. Earlier in May, Allahabad HC had rejected a plea by Rahul challenging summons in a case, saying freedom of speech didn't include the right to ""defame"" the Army. On Bihar poll trail Tuesday, Rahul lashed out at what he described as PM Narendra Modi's ""digital distractions"" as he accused Centre of using social media to divert youths from the real issues of unemployment and inequality.""They gave cheap data instead of jobs. They told youth to make reels instead of asking questions. Watching and making reels has become an addiction - a distraction to keep young people silent. The money goes to industrialists. Youths are left with entertainment as a drug,"" Rahul said.He accused CM Nitish Kumar of having ""reduced Bihar's youth to becoming nation's labourers"", saying the CM had failed to create opportunities for the young. ""Bihar, once home to the world-renowned Nalanda University, has now been reduced to a land where young people are forced to migrate across India for menial work. Nitish has made the sons of this soil labourers, not builders of Bihar's future,"" Rahul said.","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi stirs controversy by claiming ""10% of the country's population"" controls the Army.

Lakhpati Didi Scheme: PM Modi Empowers Over 20 Lakh Women in Bihar with Cash Support Ahead of Polls

NEW DELHI: Direct cash transfers to women have become the norm across states, with 12 now offering them, up from two in 2022-23. This year, the states are cumulatively projected to spend Rs 1,68,050 crore, or 0.5% of GDP, on unconditional cash transfers to women, a study by PRS Legislative Research has said. Just two years ago, the figure was less than 0.2% of GDP.Be it Gruh Lakshmi in Karnataka, Ladli Behna in MP, Ladki Behin in Maharashtra or Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana in Bihar, parties across the political spectrum have been using cash transfers to women as a way to quickly reach out to voters ahead of polls. The beneficiaries are clearly happy, although the state exchequer feels the strain of such bounties.Assam and West Bengal, where assembly elections are due next year, have increased allocation for these schemes. Compared to the revised estimates for the last financial year, Assam has increased the outlay by 31%, while the rise in Bengal is 15%. In Oct 2024, Jharkhand increased the monthly payout under the CM Maiyan Samman Yojana from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500.Parties often have to roll back some of them as state finances do not give them headroom to spend. For instance, the report said, in April, Maharashtra reduced the monthly benefit under CM Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 500 for women receiving Rs 1,000 under another direct benefit transfer scheme for farmers.A trend that started with cash transfers to farmers in Odisha has since been expanded. RBI has already cautioned states on the rising spend on subsidies, farm loan waivers and cash transfers. The PRS report says, ""Among the 12 states implementing unconditional cash transfer schemes, six have estimated a revenue deficit in 2025-26. However, adjusting the revenue balance to exclude spending on UCT schemes shows an improvement in fiscal indicators of these states. That is, all other things remaining constant, these cash transfers result in Karnataka moving from a revenue surplus of 0.3% of GSDP to a revenue deficit of 0.6% of GSDP. Similarly, these transfers reduce Madhya Pradesh's revenue surplus from 1.1% of GSDP to a marginal 0.4% of GSDP.""","This year, states are projected to spend Rs 1,68,050 crore on unconditional cash transfers to women.

Shutdown 'TURBULENCE' Hits U.S. Aviation; Unpaid Air Traffic Controllers Threaten Flight Ops

NEW DELHI: Air India will operate a relief flight on Tuesday to bring back 228 passengers stranded in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This comes after the airline's San Francisco–Delhi flight was diverted on Monday due to a technical issue.The airline said the special relief flight, numbered AI183, will depart from Delhi on Tuesday afternoon and return with the affected passengers on Wednesday morning. The flight will be operated using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.The diversion occurred after pilots on flight AI174, operating from San Francisco to Delhi via Kolkata, detected a possible technical issue mid-air and made a precautionary landing at Ulaanbaatar. The Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 245 people, including 228 passengers and 17 crew members, landed safely.“Air India will be operating a relief flight to ferry the passengers of flight AI174 (San Francisco–Delhi of November 2), which was diverted to Ulaanbaatar on Monday. The ferry flight AI183 is scheduled to depart Delhi this afternoon and return with the affected passengers on Wednesday morning,” an Air India spokesperson said.The airline added that it has been working closely with local authorities and the Indian Embassy in Mongolia to assist all passengers and crew. Arrangements for hotel accommodation, meals and regular updates have been made for those stranded.“At Air India, the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew remain our top priority,” the spokesperson said.Air India confirmed that the diverted Boeing 777 is undergoing necessary technical checks in Ulaanbaatar. Once cleared by engineers, the aircraft will be flown back separately.This is not the first time an Air India long-haul flight has had to divert due to technical reasons. In 2023, an Air India San Francisco–Delhi flight made a precautionary landing in Magadan, Russia, after a technical issue was detected mid-air.Another diversion occurred in 2024, when a flight on the same route landed in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. In both cases, passengers were later repatriated using alternate aircraft.","Air India will operate a relief flight on Tuesday to bring back 228 passengers stranded in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

"'Aero models, drones not same'; government urged to review draft bill",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aero-models-drones-not-same-government-urged-to-review-draft-bill/articleshow/125098814.cms,"MUMBAI: The Indian Aeromodellers Association (IAMA) has urged the ministry of civil aviation to reconsider certain provisions of the draft civil drone (promotion and regulation) bill, 2025, stating that the legislation, in its current form, could make it nearly impossible for enthusiasts, schools, and clubs to continue the century-old tradition of aeromodelling in India.In a detailed representation to the ministry sent last month, the IAMA said the most crucial detail was that the bill clubbed aeromodelling with drones without appreciating the vast difference between the two. Drones are typically used for commercial, industrial, or surveillance purposes, while aeromodelling is a recreational and educational activity that has ""inspired generations of pilots, aircraft engineers, and aviation professionals. ""The present draft of the Drone Bill is overly restrictive and, if implemented as is, will effectively end aeromodelling in India, the association said. It argued that the proposed framework - which mandates registration, licensing, type certification, and flight permissions - is unsuitable for non-autonomous, manually flown model aircraft that pose minimal risk.Under the draft law, no person may own or operate any unmanned aircraft without registration and a unique identification number (UIN).Violation can attract fines up to Rs1 lakh or imprisonment up to one year. The bill also makes violations of restricted airspace rules ""cognisable and non-compoundable,"" punishable by imprisonment up to three years or fines up to Rs1 lakh.""Aeromodelling is a low-risk, high learning activity...,"" the letter said. Almost all of their members design, build, and fly their own model aircraft-not multi-rotor drones. Since these are individually made and not bought from any manufacturers, it would be impossible to register them under the bill's rules, the IAMA said.The IAMA sought clear exemptions and recognition for educational and recreational model aircraft within the bill. The association urged the ministry to restore aeromodelling to the educational and sports category, as it was before 2021.","The Indian Aeromodellers Association (IAMA) has urged the ministry of civil aviation to reconsider certain provisions of the draft civil drone (promotion and regulation) bill, 2025.

Can the EPA's Pollution Limits Curb Climate Change?

NEW DELHI: The global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission increased by 2.3% in 2024, compared to the previous year, to reach a record high of 57.7 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, with India reporting the highest absolute increase in emissions followed by China, Russia, Indonesia and the US, showed a UN report released on Tuesday. It warned the world is “heading for a serious escalation of climate risks and damages”.It said that the global average temperature is projected to rise 2.3-2.5 degree Celsius by the end of the century above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) even if the climate actions are fully implemented under the new mitigation goals of the countries amid rising carbon emissions. It means the new climate pledges are completely off target and fall short on the warming limit goal.The absolute increase in emissions excludes the emission caused by change in land use and forest cover due uncertainties in estimates of net emission from such factors. It primarily calculates emissions of fossil CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases.Currently, the six largest emitters in terms of total GHG emissions are China, the US, India, EU, Russia and Indonesia. The report noted that among the big emitters, the European Union was the only one to decrease emissions in 2024.“The 2.3% increase in total GHG emissions (globally in 2024) from 2023 levels is high compared with the 2022–2023 increase of 1.6%. It is more than four times higher than the annual average growth rate in the 2010s (0.6% per year), and comparable to the emissions growth in the 2000s (on average 2.2% per year),” said the report.In terms of growth rate, Indonesia showed the highest increase (4.6%) followed by India (3.6%). Emissions growth in China (0.5% in 2024) was lower than the previous year.The report underlined that the contributions by current, per capita and historic emissions differ across the high emitters and world regions. Per capita GHG emissions are above the world average of 6.4 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) in the US, Russia, China and EU, and remain significantly below it in Indonesia and India.Flagging how the growing emission and the countries' low mitigation targets put the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree C of warming at risk in the short-term (within the next decade), the report - UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025 - noted that the rise will go up to 2.8 degree Celsius in the business-as-usual scenario under the ongoing policies.Though the current projected rise of 2.3-2.5 degree C is an improvement over the previous year’s projection of 2.6-2.8 degree C rise, the report noted that the updated pledges are not adequate to get the desired result of keeping the global warming either within 1.5 degree C or 2 degree C. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement 10 years ago, temperature rise predictions have, however, fallen from 3-3.5 degree C — a clear sign that the world can keep it further down with more ambitious emission reduction targets.The report said that the reductions to annual emissions of 35% and 55%, compared with 2019 levels, are needed by 2035 to align with the Paris Agreement 2 degree C and 1.5 degree C pathways, respectively.“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said Inger Andersen, executive director, UNEP.The report comes as a warning signal to governments ahead of the UN climate conference (COP30), scheduled to be held in Belem, Brazil during Nov 10-21.Despite the Paris Agreement requirement to submit new climate action targets - called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - by February, only 64 countries covering 63% of global GHG emissions had submitted or announced new NDCs by the cut-off date of Sept 30. India is expected to submit its target for 2035 in the next few days.“Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target,” said Andersen.The report noted that though NDCs have, overall, become modestly more robust over time, it’s at nowhere near the pace needed, and the new NDCs have done little to accelerate progress.“In addition to the lack of progress in pledges, a huge implementation gap remains, with countries not on track to meet their 2030 NDCs, let alone new 2035 targets,” it said.","The global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission increased by 2.3% in 2024, compared to the previous year, to reach a record high of 57.7 gigatons of CO2 equivalent.

EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Enumeration for Phase II of the SIR exercise spanning a dozen states and UTs commenced Tuesday, with around 5.3 lakh booth level officers (BLOs) undertaking the first round of house-to-house visits to distribute enumeration forms to electors.The enumeration period for SIR in nine states - Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, MP, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - and three UTs (Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep and Puducherry) will last a month, until Dec 4, 2025. Every elector who figured in the electoral roll as of Oct 27, 2025, will be handed a unique EF with partially pre-filled fields.Given the lack of finality on its NRC exercise, Assam has been left out of Phase II of SIR and could see a mere special summary revision ahead of assembly polls in state next year.""Distribution of EFs has already begun in all 12 states/UTs and 100% of EFs have been printed,"" EC said Tuesday.Unlike Phase I of SIR completed in Bihar, no documents will be collected from electors at the enumeration stage. Only electors who fail to furnish details linking them to the electoral roll from the last SIR undertaken in 2003/03/04, will be served a notice by the electoral registration officer after the draft electoral rolls are published on Dec 9.Such an elector will need to furnish one of the 11 documents listed by EC, or an alternative document, to prove their eligibility for enrolment. Aadhaar will be accepted only as proof of identity.Over 5.3 lakh BLOs, 7.6 lakh booth level agents appointed by political parties, 10,448 EROs/assistant EROs and 321 district election officers will come together to implement the SIR spanning 321 districts and 1,843 assembly constituencies.There are dissenting voices against the SIR exercise in opposition-governed West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, but the poll panel has confidence in Constitutional norms that make it obligatory for state govts to place their officials on deputation to the commission and maintain law and order for a smooth roll revision.","EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar.

MUMBAI: The 2025 edition of World Nuclear Exhibition (WNE) will witness a global nuclear renaissance, commitment to fusion energy as a long-term solution, and integrated global supply chain for fusion and nuclear energy, Indian Youth Nuclear Society (IYNS) vice-president Samyak Munot has said.India's nuclear achievements are being showcased at the three-day WNE, which began in Paris on Tuesday, by the 11-year-old private youth forum and not an official body for the second consecutive time. Nearly 25,000 participants from about 80 countries are taking part in the event.Speaking to TOI from Paris, Munot said this year's presentation was more detailed compared to 2023. Participation this year will also focus on India's capability in advanced reactor technology such as its first micro nuclear reactor, called SUK-M, a joint co-operation with Indian industries, and a VIP event jointly organised with the Embassy of France in India.IYNS, Munot said, had been contributing to Indo-French collaboration with nuclear and fusion start-ups in the past two years.Since its inception in 2014, IYNS's role has been to make Indian youth aware of the country's nuclear programme and involve them in it, he added."," 2025 edition of World Nuclear Exhibition will witness a global nuclear renaissance.

NEW DELHI: The number of road deaths in 2024 is set to surpass that in 2023 with over two dozen states and UTs, including Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Telangana, Assam and Delhi reporting higher number of fatalities last year. As per provisional data compiled from states/UTs, excluding West Bengal, a little over 1.7 lakh people died in road crashes last year.In 2023, road crashes had claimed around 1.73 lakh lives, the highest ever for a year, and West Bengal had reported 6,027 of these fatalities. Sources said that once data from West Bengal is included, the number of deaths would be more than that in the previous year. Data sent by states on crashes, fatalities, injuries and the factors responsible for them are being rechecked and reconciled before the final report is published, they added.While the rise in fatalities despite efforts of the govt to curb them remains a huge concern, there is a silver lining to the provisional data for 2024: nine states and UTs have reported a decline in the number of deaths. For example, Kerala reported 3,846 fatalities in 2024 compared to 4,080 in the previous year, and Gujarat recorded 7,717 deaths last year compared to 7,854 in 2023.Experts maintain that unless there is a significant dip in fatalities in the 10 states that report a large share of the overall figure, achieving the goal to reduce the number of road deaths by half will not be possible.“There is a need for focussed efforts to reduce fatal crashes and deaths on National Highways and state highways, which account for nearly 60% of all fatalities,” said a former Union road transport secretary.Though data on road accidents do not fully represent the magnitude of the problem given that not all such incidents are reported or recorded by police, the provisional data show that 35 states and UTs reported over 4.7 lakh crashes in 2024 compared to 4.8 lakh in the previous year.Meanwhile, the road transport ministry plans to amend the Motor Vehicle Act by introducing stricter norms for issuing driving licence and negative points for bad driver behaviour that can result in suspension and even cancellation of licences.","Number of road deaths in 2024 likely to surpass 2023 figure, the highest ever.

NEW DELHI: National Commission for Women has recommended a comprehensive review of cyber laws relating to women to secure their digital rights, extend privacy protections and hold online platforms accountable.For instance, the NCW report calls for inclusion of cyberbullying, trolling, deepfakes, and privacy violations in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 and protects the complainant’s identity in cyber offences. For protecting children it is recommended that digital manipulation and online grooming should be recognised as offences and penalties must be increased under the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.These are part of the over 200 actionable recommendations in the NCW report aimed at addressing the legal and institutional gaps in India’s response to cyber offences. “Through this report, NCW envisions a cyber ecosystem where laws do not merely punish offenders, but protect dignity; where awareness replaces fear; and where every woman can step into the digital world without hesitation,” NCW chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar said.The recommendations compiled following a year-long exercise of consultations with various stakeholders have been submitted to the ministries of law and justice, electronics and information technology, women and child development, and home affairs.For instance in the Information Technology Act 2002, it is recommended to make room for tougher penalties for offences against women and children, penal action for threats to share private or obscene content and a mandatory victim compensation fund.In case of IT Rules 2021, recommendations range from mandatory account verification and inclusion of AI-manipulated imagery and new provisions for gender-based harassment to cross-border content regulation.With regards to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 it is recommended that “sensitive personal data” and “gender-specific damage” should be defined and there should be stricter consent norms and mandatory removal of non-consensual content within 12 hours. The report also calls for paving the way for tiered penalties for gendered data misuse.To secure women at the workplace under the POSH Act, 2013, it recommended extending protection to digital harassment and remote workplaces. It is also recommended to cover online and OTT content under the Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986.","National Commission for Women has recommended a comprehensive review of cyber laws relating to women.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

BATHINDA: Over 170 leading organisations, experts, artists and activists from across the world – representing parliamentarians, health professionals, sustainable businesses, Indigenous communities, workers, children and young people, and concerned citizens – have signed an open letter urging governments and policymakers to put health at the heart of climate action at COP30 in Belém, Brazil.The letter has been sent to over 50 health ministers and other policymakers from every continent ahead of COP30 to ensure its demands are firmly on the agenda for this year’s political negotiations.The open letter signed by a diverse range of global organisations and individuals, including Filmmaker Adam McKay, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, Amnesty International, Child Rights International Network, COP30 Youth Climate Champion Marcele Oliveira, COP30 Health Envoy Ethel Maciel, Force of Nature, Global Climate and Health Alliance, Médicins Sans Frontières, Public Services International, Olio, Resilient Cities Network, UNITE Parliamentarians Network for Global Health, Climate Activists Vanessa Nakate, Disha Ravi, Luisa Neubauer, Tori Tsui, and more, is spearheaded by Think-Film Impact Production for its ‘healthy planet now’ campaign.The letter demands that national leaders recognise the escalating health crisis driven by fossil fuel dependency and climate breakdown and respond with policies that prioritise public health and wellbeing within and beyond the Belem Health Action Plan (BHAP).At COP30, governments are expected to adopt the BHAP—a global roadmap for climate-resilient and sustainable health systems co-developed by Brazil's Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO).Signatories stress that the BHAP is promising, but must go further, including by naming fossil fuels as a central threat to human health and committing real resources to adaptation and prevention.Five fundamental action points have been outlined for the countries in the letter, urging to phase out fossil fuels for a just, healthy transition. Finance local climate action that strengthens systems and builds resilience. Keep climate and health policy free from harmful industry influence. Integrate health and wellbeing across climate, environment, nature, food, energy, transport, and other policies, narratives and targets. Embed planetary health education and training across systems for better worker safety and patient outcomes.“Promoting resilient health systems is a central objective of the COP30 Action Agenda. Efforts like this Open Letter are helping build a broad coalition to drive implementation of the Belém Health Action Plan and its shared goals. I am pleased to add my name as the COP30 Health Envoy and to see a wide range of partners doing the same as we move closer to the 30th Conference of the Parties in Belém. This letter sends an unequivocal message that health is an essential component of climate action. ” Ethel Maciel, COP30 Special Envoy for Health“The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue. It is a health and human rights emergency. Governments need to take decisive action to fully phase out fossil fuels, to save lives, build resilient communities and uphold people's right to a healthy environment.” Dr. Marta Schaaf, Director of the Program on Climate, Economic, and Social Justice, and Corporate Accountability, Amnesty International“Public service workers are the frontline responders to climate catastrophes. From firefighters and emergency personnel to nurses and public transport operators, a rapid transition to low-carbon activities is essential to safeguard their wellbeing and ensure a resilient workforce."" Daniel Bertossa, General Secretary, Public Services International""Nurses are at the frontlines of climate change, protecting the health of communities while fossil-fuel driven climate change strains health systems already stretched thin. To adapt to our changing climate, climate and planetary health must be a mandatory part of healthcare worker training worldwide."" Cara Cook, Deputy Director, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy EnvironmentsThe letter highlights and warns that climate change is already “a direct public health emergency”, linking fossil fuel combustion to nearly 8 million premature deaths each year, and highlighting the mental health toll on communities facing displacement, extreme heat and pollution. It further emphasises the urgency for governments to act to make health a strategic priority and mainstream it across sectors, whilst identifying the importance of implementing both top-down structural solutions and finance, and bottom-up support and incentives for localised and community efforts.""COP30 is not just another climate summit — it’s a defining moment to put people’s health and lives at the center of climate decisions, ensuring a just transition that safeguards communities, families, and future generations."" Jeni Miller, Director, Global Climate and Health AllianceThe Healthy Planet Now initiative is associated with an upcoming documentary film, My Planet Now , produced by Sandpaper Films and co-directed by Jenny Saunders and Henry Singer, a participatory documentary following individuals across the globe as they deal firsthand with the impacts of climate-related challenges and step up to take action. Many of the contributors’ stories shine a light on the health impacts of climate breakdown and our dependence on fossil fuels. The film inspires audiences worldwide to take climate action, with Healthy Planet Now spearheading a new wave of people demanding change.“Every signature on this letter represents a shared story of human resilience and hope. It is essential that policy leaders champion films like My Planet Now, which translate the urgency of the climate and health crisis into emotion and movement - because only when people feel the story will they fight to change its ending.” Amy Shepherd, Chief Operating Officer, Think-Film Impact Production.","Over 170 organisations, experts, artists and activists from across the world have signed an open letter urging governments to put health at the heart of climate action.

Gold Card versus EB-5





EB-5's rising momentum





MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite its high approval rate, the EB-5 route remains a risky mix of financial investment, immigration strategy, and trust in the US market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it.

Didn't expect govt to file application at midnight: CJI

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday deprecated the Union government's request, made mid-hearing, to refer to a five-judge bench petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Tribunal Reforms Act, which sets out uniform service conditions for chairpersons and members of various tribunals.A bench led by CJI B R Gavai, which had heard the arguments of petitioners and adjourned hearing at attorney general R Venkataramani's request, to enable his participation in an international arbitration, said it was shocking for the Centre to make this request after the petitioners concluded arguments.""We do not expect the Union of India to take such a stand and play tactics with the court,"" said CJI Gavai, who will retire 20 days later. ""We heard the petitioners' counsel ...and others fully on merit. The AG did not point out even once that the Centre would request for reference of the issue to a 5-J bench.""""We will reject this application with an observation that the Union govt is making attempts to avoid the bench (as CJI is demitting office shortly),"" the CJI said.The attorney general (AG) said the same was never his or the govt's intention but accepted pleading for reference to a five-judge bench, saying he did so after concluding that substantial questions of law involved made it a fit case for adjudication by a Constitution bench.But CJI BR Gavai-led bench was unforgiving and said, ""We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics that too by filing an application at midnight prior to scheduled hearing. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.""CJI Gavai added that, ""If we, on consideration of the arguments, arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-judge bench, we will do so.""The bench went on to hear the AG, who defended the legislation bringing uniformity of service conditions for tribunal chairpersons and members.It adjourned further hearing to Nov 7.In its application, the Union govt had said, ""The case at hand raises substantial questions of law relating to the interpretation of the Constitution, which would require that the case be referred to a bench of not less than five judges in terms of Article 145(3) of the Constitution.""Another question raised by the Centre was whether Supreme Court has the power to issue a 'mandamus' to the Union of India or to Parliament to frame a law in a particular manner and in no other manner and whether such power would not violate the doctrine of separation of powers, a fundamental feature of the Constitution.The Centre's application further asked whether the plenary power of Parliament to make legislation can at all be circumscribed by directives issued by the court in a previous case.","CJI Gavai: ""We do not expect the Union of India to take such a stand and play tactics with the court"" ""We will reject this application with an observation that the Union govt is making attempts to avoid the bench,"" the CJI said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125077245,imgsize-442899,width-400,resizemode-4/cji-br-gavai.jpg"
"Opened after 54 years, Banke Bihari treasury reveals dust, raises doubts; SC-appointed panel is now auditing assets of temple",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opened-after-54-years-banke-bihari-treasury-reveals-dust-raises-doubts-sc-appointed-panel-is-now-auditing-assets-of-temple/articleshow/125027537.cms,"SC-Appointed Panel Is Now Auditing Assets Of Temple

MATHURA: The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries-old offerings, was opened last month after 54 years on the orders of an SC-appointed panel tasked with overseeing the temple's financial, structural and administrative functioning. But what emerged from the vault shocked many: one gold and three silver bars and utensils. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit, covering bank deposits worth up to Rs 400 crore, sealed lockers, land holdings and donation records - as questions mount over where the ""missing treasure"" is.Like on every Dhanteras, on Oct 18, the priest lit a small earthen lamp and placed it at the foot of the door of the treasury. The wood had darkened, carvings dulled, a panel eaten halfway by termites. No key had survived and a metal cutter was brought in. Snake catchers moved in first as forest officials stood by with oxygen cylinders. Behind the panels - sealed for more than five decades - lay the toshakhana.When it opened, there was no gold crown as expected. Or a gemstone necklace. Just a long wooden box containing a single gold bar and three silver bars streaked faintly with vermilion.Around them, there were brass utensils, wooden trays, and layers of dust so thick that one official described it as ""undisturbed for generations"". The chamber yielded no spectacle. But what it did offer was unsettling - the near-total absence of any official record of what had once been kept there: no donor register, no inventory, no valuation documents, and no reconciliation with decades of temple offerings.The toshakhana, last opened in 1971, had been spoken of for years in reverent tones - a place where ornaments, royal gifts from Bharatpur, Karauli and Gwalior, land deeds and handwritten letters were believed to lie, donated by kings and commoners to ""Thakurji"". Instead, the inventory was strikingly thin and sparked disbelief among devotees, demands for a CBI probe from locals, and a quiet but unmistakable scrutiny of the shrine's financial history.As of now, the items found in the toshakhana have not been formally valued, though they have been sealed. No FIR has been filed, and no report has been made public. ""The audit is on. This is the first official attempt to document the temple's assets,"" said a senior official associated with the panel. ""We don't have the full inventory yet. Even the panel is trying to find out. A CA firm has been appointed.""Banke Bihari temple, founded in 1864 by followers of saint and musician Swami Haridas, receives some 50,000 visitors a day - a number that rises to several lakhs on festivals and auspicious days. Yet unlike temples in the south, whose wealth was historically documented and regulated under systems of royal patronage and formal audits, Banke Bihari has evolved with a structure rooted in tradition rather than regulation. Offerings - jewellery, land, cash - have come in over generations, but few comprehensive records exist to track them.Among devotees, reactions have been mixed. ""My devotion is to the deity, not to any treasure,"" said Ramesh Patel, a Surat-based cloth trader who visits Vrindavan two or three times a year. ""Yes, I too was expecting something spectacular. But I am not disappointed. We hope all the assets will eventually be documented."" Others, however, have gone further. Dinesh Falhari, a local, has written to PM Narendra Modi seeking a CBI probe. Several residents in the vicinity have echoed the concern.The committee, chaired by retired HC judge Ashok Kumar, was formed after a series of PILs raised concerns over crowd management and administrative lapses. The recent vault opening has prompted the panel to expand its scope and begin a full structural and financial audit - the temple's first.As per official estimates, the temple holds between Rs 350 to 400 crore across over 10 bank accounts in Mathura and Vrindavan, most currently in Multi-Option Deposit form - a product that offers lower interest rates than fixed deposits. The panel has directed that these accounts be converted into FDs for better returns and asked bank officials to submit details of the temple's funds and their status.The audit has also raised questions about assets held outside the temple premises. While members of the Goswami community - hereditary sevayats who manage rituals and daily operations - acknowledge that jewellery had once been deposited in SBI's Mathura branch, there is no documentation on when this was done or what was deposited. ""Still not with us,"" said the official. ""The Goswamis say the jewellery is there. But no order to open the lockers has been given yet. We don't have a list of items, and there is no record of valuation.""There is no exhaustive list of temple-owned land, income from leases, or encroachment details. Officials have said that the local tehsildar and SDM have been asked to retrieve land records from around the temple. The temple manager has also been asked to prepare a consolidated report of all bank accounts, financial assets and donation receipts before the panel's next meeting on Nov 19.Within the sevayat community, there is growing discomfort over public speculation around the temple's finances. ""People are comparing Banke Bihari with temples in the south,"" said Shailendra Goswami, a member of the committee and part of the lineage of Swami Haridas. ""But those temples were built by kings. Our's was built in stages, in 1864, with around Rs 70,000 collected from devotees. Even the large Hindola (rocking cradle) was made from offerings. Some of Bihariji's jewellery is in the SBI branch - this has been shared with the committee. No one can make a single accusation against the priests.""Three of the four Goswami members who are part of the high-powered committee confirmed that their concerns had been placed on record at the committee's Oct 29 meeting. Among the issues discussed was the crowd situation and the perception being created around the vault opening. ""This is Bihariji's temple,"" one of them said. ""The service is done by love. Let them do their audit. We have nothing to hide.""","The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple was opened last month. It is believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries- old offerings.

Vande Bharat sleeper train: What are the issues?







Vande Bharat sleeper train: Indian Railways is aiming to launch the first Vande Bharat sleeper train in the coming months, but ahead of its launch the Ministry of Railways has highlighted concerns regarding the quality of furnishings and craftsmanship.Vande Bharat sleeper train will be a variant of the chair car air-conditioned service, aimed at long-distance travel on the Indian Railways network. The Vande Bharat sleeper trains are expected to offer a premium passenger experience, better than Rajdhani Express trains. The first ten trainsets are being manufactured by BEML, in collaboration with ICF Chennai.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently said that two rakes of Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be launched together.According to a PTI report, in a recent written correspondence to the Director General, Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) and General Managers across railway zones, the Railway Board identified several deficiencies.""There are issues related to furnishing and workmanship at many places in respect of sharp edges and comers at berthing area, window curtain handles, pigeon pockets between berth connectors inviting cleaning issues etc,"" the Board said.The Board emphasised that remedial actions are essential for the present rake, whilst also stating that design enhancements would be required for subsequent rakes.The Railway Ministry has instructed zones to comply with all RDSO-specified conditions for operations reaching speeds of 160 kmph.Officials explained the authorisation procedure, stating that after RDSO obtains final CCRS approval for new train designs, CCRS forwards the matter to the Railway Ministry for operational clearance.""The CCRS during trial conveys its observations to the RDSO for compliance. In the case of the Vande Bharat Sleeper Train, the RDSO sent its updated compliance on September 1, 2025,"" officials said.Officials noted that since the Vande Bharat Sleeper Train's route remains undecided, the Ministry distributed its letter dated October 28 across all zones.The Ministry has emphasised adherence to several requirements, including fire safety protocols, installation of Kavach 4.0, establishment of reliable communication between loco pilots, train managers and station masters, and proper brake system maintenance.The railway authorities instructed regional divisions to train engine drivers for emergency uncoupling of semi-permanent couplers within 15 minutes, ensuring essential tools are included in the driver and guard equipment sets.""Suitable setting of temperature inside coaches shall be maintained to ensure comfortable conditions to passengers, considering ambient conditions and frequent opening & closing of doors,"" they specified.The Ministry emphasised the importance of having trained technical personnel available to address any operational difficulties and emergencies during the journey.""Regular announcements shall be made through the PA system informing all persons other than passengers to disembark from the train before its departure. Also, pre-recorded Passenger safety announcements in three languages (Regional, Hindi & English) should be made during the run to sensitize passengers about personal safety norms to be observed during travel,"" according to the directive.Additionally, the Ministry instructed regional divisions to assign skilled and dedicated personnel for Vande Bharat Sleeper Trainset maintenance, whilst ensuring sufficient spare parts and consumables are readily available.","Vande Bharat sleeper train will be a variant of the chair car air-conditioned service, aimed at long-distance travel on the Indian Railways network.

World’s most expensive aquarium fish: A rare dragon fish that symbolises power and fortune worth approx Rs 3 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-most-expensive-aquarium-fish-a-rare-dragon-fish-that-symbolises-power-and-fortune-worth-approx-rs-3-crore/articleshow/124895285.cms,"Source: New York Post

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

"Inside India’s voyeur web: 80 CCTV dashboards hacked across 20 states; hospitals, schools, homes streamed to porn channels; 50,000 clips sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/inside-indias-voyeur-web-80-cctv-dashboards-hacked-across-20-states-hospitals-schools-homes-streamed-to-porn-channels-50000-clips-sold/articleshow/125073851.cms,"



RAJKOT: A shocking cybercrime has rocked India’s digital security landscape, with hackers stealing at least 50,000 CCTV clips over nine months from facilities across the country and selling them online for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000 per clip, feeding them into an international porn fetish network for profit.Investigators revealed that 80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more.The scam came to light when teaser clips from Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot appeared on YouTube channels like “Megha Mbbs” and “cp monda”, leading customers to Telegram groups where the stolen footage was sold.Officials said the breaches were made possible by default passwords such as “admin123”, enabling hackers to launch automated attacks and collect massive amounts of sensitive footage.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ‘admin123’, which had not been changed during setup.This enabled the hackers to initiate an aggressive and automated assault.An officer from the cybercrime branch in Ahmedabad told TOI: “The primary method used was a ‘brute force attack’ (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).” Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this.“First, Dhameliya used a website called suIP.biz to obtain the IP addresses (the unique online location) of cameras in Gujarat. These IPs were then fed into a software called ‘Masscan’ which quickly scanned for open ports (the specific digital doorways that allow remote communication).”Next, the attackers used a specialized hacking tool called ‘SWC software’, which can reveal a camera’s ID, password, and IP address once the system is compromised. Using these stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya — later arrested in Delhi and who had posed as a medical laboratory technology diploma holder — accessed the hospital’s cameras through the DMSS application, a tool normally used for legitimate remote viewing.The officer added, “To access this sensitive footage cost around Rs 700 per person, though the highest-demand voyeuristic clips sold for up to Rs. 4,000. Praj Patil, also a NEET aspirant, acted as the financial facilitator, providing his mobile number and bank account to collect subscription payments.”To conceal their location, the attackers relied heavily on international infrastructure, routing their activities through virtual private networks (VPNs) that made their origins appear to be in cities like Bucharest in Romania, and New York in the US.The massive scale of unauthorized access — exceeding 11,000 successful external sessions in total — was meticulously tracked through log files spanning from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024. The core members, including Prajwal Teli, Praj Patil, and Chandraprakash Phoolchand, were arrested within 39 hours of the FIR being registered. The threat actors were charged under several sections of the BNS Act and IT Act, including cyber terrorism.","80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more.

BENGALURU: A steel distribution company employee lost Rs 80 lakh after he fell off his scooter and lost consciousness in Cantonment railway bridge underpass Saturday.Police are yet to ascertain if it is a robbery or theft as the injured man, Waseem Akram, said he felt like someone pushed him from behind while he was riding the scooter with the cash bag on his footrest.Akram's employer, Haseen Begh, who runs a steel business with 15 employees in Azeez Sait Industrial Estate near Nayandahalli, supplies steel, including waste steel, to shops in multiple locations in the city. Akram regularly collected payments from clients for the materials supplied to them.On the day of the incident, Akram collected cash from clients in Peenya Industrial Area and JC Nagar. He was heading towards Shivajinagar to collect more money and then to Chamarajpet. He had collected around Rs 80 lakh in cash and had about 160 bundles of notes. He kept the cash bag on the footrest of his scooter.An autorickshaw driver passing by the underpass around 8.30pm noticed Akram lying unconscious on the roadside. He rushed him to a hospital on Queens Road. Begh was waiting for Akram to return with the cash and tried to call him at 9pm. The auto driver responded, saying he found Akram, who had sustained a head injury, unconscious after falling from the scooter.When Begh rushed to the hospital, Akram had regained consciousness by then.When Begh asked Akram how he was injured, the latter said he'd collected cash from Peenya and JC Nagar and while riding in the underpass, he felt like someone pushed him from behind. He lost balance and crashed into the underpass wall and fell from his scooter.Akram said his scooter and bag might still be at the spot. The auto driver said he remembered seeing the two-wheeler but was not aware of any bag. Begh then sent his brother to the underpass to check the scooter and bag, but he only found the two-wheeler.A police officer said Akram is not clear whether someone pushed him from behind or a car hit him. He remembers the scooter and a car colliding before he crashed into the wall. There is no CCTV camera at the spot. ""We are checking cameras from surrounding areas,"" the officer said.A case has been registered under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) Section 303 (theft).","Waseem Akram said he felt like someone pushed him from behind while he was riding the scooter with the cash bag on his footrest.

'I'm Broken': Lone AI-171 Crash Survivor Speaks Out; Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK

‘Completely Broken Down’

Viswashkumar Ramesh and his brother Ajaykumar

Getting On A Plane, Again

Early Days In Leicester

With Almost No Income Now

‘Situation Is Desperate’





On June 12, the whole world saw him walk away, alone, from the burning wreckage of the crashed AI 171 flight from Ahmedabad to London’s Gatwick. There was black smoke billowing out of the Air India flight, its tail end sticking out of a building where it had crashed, and, on the ground, this man in a white tee and grey trousers, walking with a slight limp, and repeating over and over again, “Plane fatyo che ! Plane fatyo che ! (The plane has exploded!)”He was the lone survivor. There were 242 on board that flight — 230 passengers and 12 crew members; 241 of them were dead, some charred beyond recognition. How could anyone walk out of that wreckage? This was a miracle to beat all miracles — an outcome only a very benign God could have ordained.And yet, a little over four and a half months later, when we meet Viswashkumar Ramesh, the 39-year-old lone crash survivor, he looks crushed and depressed, hardly someone who has beaten impossible odds and survived. What he is left with now is the struggle of picking up the pieces; but it’s a task for which he says he is yet to receive the help he needs, from the airline and the govt of UK, the country of his citizenship.We are in Leicester, UK, at the residence of Sanjiv Patel, a community leader. A silver Volvo SUV pulls up, and Viswash gets off. He lives nearby, but walking has been an issue ever since he jumped — or fell? — off the burning plane. Because of his mobility issues, he has also stopped driving. So, Patel — who is voluntarily helping the family — has organised for his pickup.Viswash hobbles into the room. He looks like a broken man, dazed, unable to focus or fully engage, morose, a haunted man.“After this tragedy — not just my wife and son — my whole family is all completely broken down. Me — physically, mentally — and my family also,” he says.On the plane, Viswash had been seated in 11A, next to the emergency exit. His younger brother, Ajaykumar, was in seat 11J. He was among the 241 who died. Viswash spent a few days in hospital, and then went back to Diu, where he is originally from. The two brothers used to run a fishing business there. While in Diu, Viswash underwent medical treatment at Rajkot.He came back to the UK on Sept 15 to get on with his medical treatment under NHS (the British medical service, which is free for all citizens) and to be with his wife Hiral and four-year-old son Divang, who’s just started school. However, he has not yet seen any doctor in the NHS nor received any psychiatric treatment or counselling in the UK.It is immediately clear that weighing heavily against the relief of his miraculous escape is the lingering grief for his brother’s death and the psychological trauma of having survived a crash in which everyone else on board died. Ever since he came back, he has spent most of his time holed up in his two-bedroom terraced house, hardly ever stepping out.Ask him what it feels like to be a miraculous survivor, and he goes silent. Then he says, “I lost my younger brother.”Just getting back to the UK was a challenge. “It was very difficult to get on an aeroplane.” He did not fly Air India and took another carrier instead. “I was very scared. I just closed my eyes and prayed to my God.“I don’t talk with my son and wife. I just keep sitting in my room alone. Because of the tragedy, whole flashbacks come to me.“My son doesn’t speak much, he is just four years old, he doesn’t understand much of what has happened, just a little bit. My wife is struggling. My shoulder, back, knee, left side are burning — there is still pain in my body. I walk slowly. I have not gone outside of the house much. I am not walking properly. I can’t drive. Mentally, I have completely broken down,” he says.“The fishing business has completely gone down. Me and my brother (Ajay) were doing it together. After this tragedy it is almost finished. My father is trying, but struggling,” Viswash says.Can he get back to his old life? “I don’t know,” he says.His parents moved to the UK about 25 years ago. His father, Ramesh, set up a garments business in Leicester. Viswash, who was born in Diu, moved to the UK when he was around 14. “I came to Leicester with my parents to start studying. Then, after a few years, I started to support my family in the garments business,” he says.However, the family wound up the UK clothing business during Covid and reinvested their money in a fishing venture in Diu. The entire extended family in Diu and Leicester were deriving their income from that business, which, Vishwas claims, had been growing steadily.Viswash and Ajay were the two key people who were hands-on in running the venture. They would spend eight to nine months in Diu and, then, around the time the fishing season ended, they would come back to the UK for three months and spend time with their families in Leicester.Then their world fell apart. Ramesh, Viswash, and his two other younger brothers — Nayankumar and Sunnykumar — tried to run it for a while after the crash, from Diu, but it proved impossible. Viswash was too traumatised to leave his Diu house. The fishermen themselves needed income and, after the crash, the family’s boats couldn’t operate for a while, so the fishermen went to look for other work. The business has virtually collapsed now.Air India has offered Viswash an interim payment of £21,500 (Rs 25 lakh) — the same payment it is offering the families of those who died in the crash. The interim payment will be adjusted against any final compensation.With Patel, in whose house we are meeting, is Radd Seiger, a retired lawyer and crisis and reputation management specialist. Patel, by profession, is a career coach, board adviser and leadership trainer. The two of them have voluntarily stepped in to help Viswash’s family. They claim both Air India and the British govt have failed Viswash. They claim the compensation offered is nowhere near enough given his complex needs.Viswash has almost no income now. To make matters worse, his wife’s Universal Credit (UK welfare benefit) was stopped because she travelled to India for two months after the crash. Universal Credit is a UK govt-funded benefit for working-age people on a low income or unemployed. It is paid as a single monthly payment.Asked about the stoppage of his wife’s payments, a UK govt spokesperson said, “People travelling abroad due to a bereavement can continue receiving Universal Credit for up to two months, rather than the standard one-month limit. Those who are abroad for longer periods would not be able to continue receiving the benefit. People can make a new claim once they return to the UK.”Viswash says, “£21,000 is nothing. I stay in the UK. I pay mortgage….”“Before, it was different — my life was going very smoothly and nice. Now, it’s completely ruined. I feel I have changed. After this plane crash, I am not meeting many people, not talking. I just stay in my room alone,” says Viswash.Even though he came back to the UK to spend time with his wife and son, he admits, “I am not spending much time with him.”“Viswash is still suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder,” says Patel. “He is doing these interviews very reluctantly. He had some treatment in India, but the NHS is not geared up for expedited care. The whole family is traumatised. We have interacted with Air India to say we need to talk about this so they get to understand their circumstances and they have not been willing to have that conversation.

China has shut Nvidia out

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of sites globally.","China has shut Nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, CEO Jensen Huang said.

CEO Satya Nadella bets on Microsoft’s year-long AI transition before expanding workforce again



Microsoft’s cost-cutting strategy delivers record margins as stock climbs above $500







Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period, CEO Satya Nadella announced, marking the first clear timeline for ending a hiring freeze that has seen over 15,000 employees cut in 2025 alone.The tech giant laid off 9,000 workers in July—its largest single round of cuts this year—followed by thousands more eliminated in January, May, and June as Nadella pushes employees to ""unlearn and relearn"" their jobs using AI tools before he'll approve new hires. The workforce purge represents a stunning reversal from fiscal 2022, when Microsoft expanded headcount by 22% in a pre-ChatGPT hiring spree.""I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,"" Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on the BG2 podcast that aired in early November.Nadella explained that the hiring pause isn't permanent—it's a strategic transition period allowing workers to fundamentally reshape how they perform their roles using AI. Employees need time to integrate tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot into their daily workflows before the company expands again.""It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,"" he said, comparing the shift to how email and Excel spreadsheets revolutionised workplace productivity decades ago.The CEO shared an example of a Microsoft networking executive who, facing massive data center expansion needs, built AI agents to handle maintenance tasks instead of hiring additional staff. ""That is an example of a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,"" Nadella noted.Despite the layoffs weighing heavily on Nadella personally—he addressed employee concerns in a July memo—investors have rewarded Microsoft's cost-cutting approach. The stock surged above $500 for the first time in July, and the company recently reported its widest operating margin since 2002 alongside 12% year-over-year revenue growth.Microsoft previously implemented selective hiring freezes in its U.S. consulting division in January 2025 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, though strategic areas like Azure cloud services continued recruiting throughout those periods.The company now expects all work to begin with AI integration. ""Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues,"" Nadella explained.","Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period.

Geoffrey Hinton warns AI risks extend beyond technology



Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

Tech giants push AI growth, not safety



Automation and AI threaten employment



Potential benefits of AI



Need for regulation and careful planning in AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly, offering transformative possibilities across industries while simultaneously raising significant societal concerns. Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the “Godfather of AI” and a Nobel Prize-winning expert in machine learning, has warned about the profound economic and ethical implications of this technology. Hinton cautions that, as AI adoption accelerates, tech billionaires like Elon Musk could see substantial financial gains, while millions of workers risk losing their jobs to automation. He emphasises that the challenges lie not only in the technology itself but in how society is structured, highlighting the urgent need to address the social and economic impact of AI alongside its technological development, urging global leaders to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in its integration.In an interview with Bloomberg Wall Street , Hinton has repeatedly highlighted that AI is not inherently harmful, but its unchecked development can lead to major societal disruption. He compares the potential dangers of AI to a “Chernobyl moment,” referring to the 1986 nuclear disaster in Ukraine that released lethal radiation and caused massive casualties. For Hinton, this analogy illustrates how technological progress, if not properly regulated, can create sudden and devastating consequences for society.He warns that the risks of AI extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society. “The reason it’s bad is because of the way society’s organised,” Hinton explained. “Musk will get richer, and a lot of people will get unemployed, and Musk won’t care. I’m using Musk as a stand-in. This isn’t an AI problem; it’s a societal organisation problem.”One of Hinton’s primary concerns is that the rapid development of AI is being driven by corporate greed rather than public interest or safety. Tech giants are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to gain a competitive edge, often prioritising profits over ethical considerations.The four major AI hyperscalers: Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon are projected to increase their combined capital expenditure from $360 billion this fiscal year to $420 billion next year. OpenAI alone has announced partnerships and infrastructure deals valued at $1 trillion with companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle. These figures highlight the immense financial stakes tied to AI, which Hinton believes incentivise job replacement over societal well-being.Hinton predicts that large-scale AI adoption will inevitably lead to widespread job losses. He argues that corporations cannot achieve maximum profit without replacing human labour with AI-driven systems. Recent evidence supports this concern. For example, job openings have dropped by approximately 30% since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, especially in entry-level positions.Amazon’s announcement of 14,000 layoffs, predominantly in middle management, further illustrates this trend. While CEO Andy Jassy attributed the decision to “culture,” an internal memo predicted a leaner workforce as the company implements efficiency gains through extensive AI deployment. Hinton’s warnings suggest that this pattern of AI-driven unemployment is likely to accelerate as corporations continue investing in automation technologies.Despite the risks, Hinton acknowledges that AI has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits. In healthcare, AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy, accelerate drug discovery, and improve patient outcomes. In education, AI-driven platforms can personalise learning experiences and broaden access to quality instruction.Hinton stresses that the challenge lies in balancing these benefits against the risks of social inequality and mass unemployment. “It’s a difficult decision because it can do tremendous good too,” he said. “Increasing productivity in many industries should be beneficial, but society must manage these changes to prevent vast numbers of people from being left behind.”When asked whether he would halt AI development altogether if possible, Hinton expressed uncertainty. “I don’t know… it’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he remarked. This highlights the complex ethical considerations surrounding AI: it is neither entirely harmful nor entirely beneficial. Policymakers, industry leaders, and society must navigate a delicate balance between innovation and safety.Hinton’s insights underscore the need for thoughtful regulation and societal planning to ensure that AI technologies enhance human well-being rather than exacerbate inequality and unemployment. The rise of AI presents both extraordinary opportunities and serious risks. While billionaires like Elon Musk may see unprecedented financial gains, millions of workers risk displacement.","Geoffrey Hinton warns that the risks of AI extend beyond the technology itself and are deeply connected to the structure of society.

Tax relief reshapes car market: Compact SUV sales surge; automakers weigh long-term demand shift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tax-relief-reshapes-car-market-compact-suv-sales-surge-automakers-weigh-long-term-demand-shift/articleshow/125100841.cms,"Representative AI image





Small SUVs have emerged as the biggest winners from the Centre’s recent tax cuts, with their share in total passenger vehicle (PV) sales climbing to 30.4 per cent in the first 10 months of 2025. In contrast, hatchbacks saw their share decline to 21.9 per cent over the same period, according to industry wholesale data accessed by ET. A year earlier, hatchbacks and small SUVs had accounted for 24 per cent and 27.1 per cent, respectively.Tarun Garg, chief operating officer at Hyundai Motor India, said the tax changes have strengthened the appeal of compact SUVs (under four metres in length). “A customer wanting to buy a vehicle has the same amount before and after the tax cuts. With vehicle prices coming down, he is now utilising the same amount to opt for a higher variant. The preference for SUVs still remains strong,” Garg said.According to him, the share of SUVs in total vehicle sales rose to 56.9 per cent in September–October, up from 54.4 per cent in January–August 2025. “Hatches will stay—20 per cent of a 4 million-plus market means that the segment will remain relevant. But growth will come in from SUVs,” Garg added.However, market leader Maruti Suzuki offered a different perspective. Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer for marketing and sales, said that while SUV sales are growing, the tax cuts have revived demand among first-time buyers. “We are getting a new set of customers in our showrooms. There are so many helmets you will see lying on tables when you visit a dealership now. There are people who want to upgrade from a two-wheeler to a 4-wheeler. We are seeing a lot of people wanting to buy small cars,” Banerjee said.He noted that the company received 25,847 bookings for mini cars last month but was able to deliver only 15,700 units due to production constraints. “Based on past offtake, the production team set capacities. It is not possible to change this overnight. We are trying to see how best to serve them,” he explained.Banerjee added that expanding the customer base will be key to sustained industry growth. “The overall market can only grow when new sets of customers come in. We are seeing early signs,” he said.Maruti Suzuki’s mini car portfolio—including the Alto K10, S-Presso, Wagon R, and Celerio—has also seen a lift, with its share in total sales rising to 20.5 per cent after the GST cut, compared with 16.7 per cent between April 1 and September 21, before the tax relief took effect.",Small SUVs have emerged as the biggest winners from the Centre’s recent tax cuts.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

'American Dream Stolen': India in the Spotlight as Trump’s H-1B Visa Misuse Ad Sparks Controversy

Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt





What is the case against him





Where is Bankim Brahmbhatt now





What next





American investment giant BlackRock has accused Bankim Brahmbhatt, the Indian-origin CEO of US-based telecom companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, of multi-million-dollar fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported.Lenders, including HPS Investment Partners - the private credit arm of BlackRock - have accused Brahmbhatt’s firms of fabricating accounts receivable that were used as collateral for loans. The lenders now claim to be owed over $500 million. Brahmbhatt’s lawyer told WSJ that his client disputed the fraud allegations.Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder, president and CEO of Bankai Group, a US-headquartered telecommunications and fintech company.In interviews with Entrepreneur Middle East and Industry Chronicle, Brahmbhatt described himself as a telecom engineer turned entrepreneur, who began his journey in 1989 by setting up a push-button telephone manufacturing unit in India. Over the years, his ventures expanded into satellite dishes, telecom billing, and digital financial solutions.Bankai Group’s flagship product, MobiFin Elite, provides digital financial services and has been implemented by clients across several countries, particularly in Africa.Brahmbhatt often spoke about his vision to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for carriers, operators, and financial institutions, combining “technical skills and people skills.”His LinkedIn profile which earlier has sizable followers appears to have deactivated.According to WSJ, HPS began lending to a financing arm linked to Brahmbhatt’s companies in September 2020, later expanding its exposure to about $430 million by August 2024, with BNP Paribas helping finance the loans.Trouble surfaced in July 2024, when an HPS employee discovered that some customer emails appeared to come from fake domains imitating real telecom firms. When questioned, Brahmbhatt reportedly assured HPS officials there was nothing to worry about, before stopping all communication.Subsequent checks by accounting firm CBIZ and law firm Quinn Emanuel, hired by the lenders, found that emails and invoices provided as proof of receivables were falsified, the report said. A Belgian telecom company, BICS, confirmed to investigators that it had no connection to the emails used by Brahmbhatt’s firms, calling it a “confirmed fraud attempt.”Court filings allege that fraudulent customer contracts dated back to 2018 and that assets pledged as collateral were transferred to offshore accounts in India and Mauritius.Brahmbhatt’s companies - Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, Carriox Capital II, and BB Capital SPV - filed for bankruptcy in August, the same month lenders sued. BNP Paribas also reported adding €190 million (around $220 million) in loan-loss provisions linked to a “specific credit situation,” though it did not name the borrower.HPS has told clients it believes Brahmbhatt is currently in India. A person who visited the New York offices of his companies in July found them closed and vacant, the WSJ report said.Brahmbhatt also filed for personal bankruptcy on August 12, the same day his companies sought Chapter 11 protection.Despite the scale of the alleged fraud, sources told WSJ that the incident represents only a small portion of HPS’s $179 billion in assets under management and is unlikely to materially affect BlackRock’s overall performance.While the US courts are now handling the bankruptcy proceedings and civil lawsuits, Brahmbhatt has denied these allegagtions and is missing. The full scope of the alleged fraud and its potential impact on BlackRock’s private credit arm and BNP Paribas remains under investigation.","Bankim Brahmbhatt is the Indian-origin CEO of US-based telecom companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice.

Who is eligible to get the Ma’al Card?

Does the Ma’al Card work internationally?





The days of relying solely on international payment giants are ending in the Sultanate. Driven by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), major local banks are launching the ""Ma'al"" Card, a groundbreaking national payment card designed to bring financial independence, unmatched cost savings, and a strong sense of Omani ownership to every digital transaction.For citizens and local businesses alike, the Ma'al Card meaning ""wealth"" or ""money"" in Arabic is set to transform your wallet, promising zero issuance fees for customers and significantly reduced transaction costs for merchants, marking a monumental step forward for the goals of Oman Vision 2040.Oman payment card explainedThe Maal card is the Central Bank of Oman’s (CBO) national payment card brand, created to run on the Sultanate’s domestic payment network (OmanNet). The name, which simply means ""money"" or ""wealth"" in Arabic, signals a significant shift towards national pride and control in the financial sector. For decades, Omani banks have relied heavily on international networks for payment cards.The Ma'al Card is set to change this by creating a robust, independent national payment system. This move strengthens Oman’s financial infrastructure, keeps transaction data secure within the country, and aligns perfectly with the economic goals of Oman Vision 2040.It will include debit, prepaid, credit, corporate and premium card types so people and businesses can pay at shops, withdraw cash, pay online, and use government e-services within Oman’s payment ecosystem.The launch of the Ma'al Card brings excellent news for every Omani, especially when it comes to saving money. The CBO has confirmed two crucial benefits designed to promote widespread usage and support the local economy:The CBO plans to offer a full range of products under the Ma'al brand, including debit, credit, payment, and prepaid cards, giving you total flexibility.Since the Ma'al Card is a brand-new national system, the application process will be simple and based on the established practices of your local bank. While the official launch date has not yet been announced, here is what you need to know:The key step for now is to follow the announcements from the Central Bank of Oman and the participating local banks.The Ma’al Card is designed to be the primary card for the entire country, meaning eligibility will be broad and tied to holding a bank account in Oman. All Omani citizens with a valid bank account at a participating institution will be eligible to apply. While the card primarily strengthens the national system, it is being rolled out by commercial banks. Therefore, legal residents of Oman (expatriates who hold a valid Residence Card/ID) who maintain a bank account with a participating local bank are expected to be eligible for the card.Since the Ma'al Card is intended to be a replacement for locally-issued cards currently relying on foreign networks, any customer who can currently receive a debit or credit card from a local Omani bank should be eligible for the Ma'al equivalent.Initially, the Ma'al Card is focused on strengthening domestic payments within the Sultanate of Oman. At the time of its initial rollout, the Ma'al Card will be primarily valid for domestic use via the existing national network, OmanNet. This includes POS (point-of-sale) payments, ATM withdrawals, and e-commerce transactions within Oman.The CBO has stated that plans are underway to enable Ma'al Card acceptance across the GCC countries through a connection with the regional network, GCCNet.There is potential for future international acceptance through bilateral agreements, but this will be a later phase.In simple terms: Use it confidently everywhere in Oman. For immediate travel outside of Oman, you may still need a card that uses a major international network (like Visa or Mastercard) until the GCCNet integration is complete.","The Ma'al Card is being rolled out by a group of six local banks.

Top Indian American immigration attorney hails Trump’s H-1B reforms; calls it ‘light over darkness’ for international students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-indian-american-immigration-attorney-hails-trumps-h-1b-reforms-as-light-over-darkness-for-international-students/articleshow/125096189.cms,"Indian Workers Face New Challenge as US Tightens Work Visa Rules Amid Crackdown on H-1B Abuse





Recent reforms to the H-1B visa system will benefit international students rather than restrict them, according to prominent Indian American immigration attorney Aparna Dave.Speaking at the “Diaspora at the Crossroads: Law, Policy and Opportunities” conference in Bethesda, Maryland, earlier this week, Dave said the new executive orders from the Trump administration mark a positive shift for those pursuing education and skilled employment in the United States, reports New India Abroad.Dave explained that revisions to the H-1B lottery and allocation process, which now prioritise graduates with advanced U.S. degrees, have created more opportunities for students finishing their studies in America. She described the changing visa regulations as “light over darkness” for those chasing the American dream through education and work pathways.Under the updated policy, which took effect in September 2025 following a presidential proclamation on H-1B reforms, international students with master’s or doctoral degrees from US institutions are more likely to be selected in the visa process.The administration has said this approach aims to retain talent already trained in American universities, encouraging highly skilled graduates to remain in the country.However, the new system also brings higher filing costs and stricter employer requirements, which could impact smaller companies. Recent rules have raised H-1B petition fees to around USD 100,000 for some employers, alongside new wage guidelines intended to favour high-skilled roles.The MAGA administration has defended the reforms as a long-term investment in America’s innovation economy, saying the system will now “reward merit, not manipulation.” Supporters argue that prioritising advanced US degree holders will reduce visa misuse and ensure that only the most qualified candidates are selected. Critics, however, warn that the steep rise in fees and compliance costs could limit diversity in the tech workforce by sidelining smaller firms and startups that rely on global talent. Immigration experts believe the true impact of these reforms will become clearer once the next H-1B lottery cycle begins in early 2026.","Recent reforms to the H-1B visa system will benefit international students, says prominent Indian American immigration attorney Aparna Dave.
