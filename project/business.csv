The post was created to ensure students' mental health issues are not left unaddressed, especially after four student suicides on campus in seven months - the latest being fourth-year mechanical engineering student Ritam Mondal, who was found hanging in his hostel room on July 18.""This is possibly the first time in any IIT that a person of a dean's status has been assigned solely to look after students' overall well-being,"" said the director. ""Our institute has a huge number of students, and it is necessary to have a designated dean of student well-being to give special emphasis to welfare activities.""Chakraborty told TOI that while the role was challenging, it was essential. ""We do not want any tragic incidents.Every student can approach us at any time. Even the smallest issues will be addressed.

NEW DELHI: Asserting that ""India will not bow down to anybody"", commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday that countries will restructure their trade routes and partners.""The world keeps evolving, international trade keeps finding new pathways. What we are seeing today is possibly a churn that is bound to happen every few years - new countries come up, some go down. This is India's time,"" he said at a Business Today event. The minister said India's exports during the current fiscal year will be higher than last year. In 2024-25, India's exports reached a record $825 billion, with goods shipments valued at over $437 billion, around the same level as the previous year.Asked about the impact of Trump tariffs, he retorted by saying that India finds opportunities in crisis. ""The nation's morale is high... There is a lot of strength in the Indian economy... India will emerge as the winner,"" he said.Trump's tariffs have induced uncertainty, especially with Indian exports to the US going to attract 50% duty from Aug 27.

Army-IAF launch another hunt for 200 light choppers to replace old Cheetahs & Chetaks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-seeks-200-copters-to-replace-ageing-cheetah-chetak-fleet/articleshow/123196628.cms,"From Crown Jewel To Flying Coffin: IAF To Phase Out Iconic Mig-21 Fighter Jets After 62 Years

NEW DELHI: India has once again resumed the hunt to replace its old single-engine Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, which lack modern avionics, in-built safety mechanisms and have been dogged by a high crash rate just like the MiG-21 fighters, causing the death of scores of pilots over the years.The Army on Friday issued a request for information (RFI) to vendors for the acquisition of 120 reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters (RSHs) and another 80 for the IAF. “The defence ministry intends to urgently replace the fleet of existing Cheetah and Chetak helicopters with suitable light helicopters of modern design,” the RFI said.The RSHs should be able to perform surveillance by day and night, transport small number troops for special missions, carry internal and external loads in support of ground operations and perform a “scout role” in conjunction with attack helicopters, the RFI added.The armed forces have been demanding new light helicopters to replace their around 350 Cheetah and Chetak choppers, which are of the design vintage of the 1960s, for well over two decades now. They have sounded the alarm several times but to no avail till now, as reported by TOI earlier.Defence officials told TOI the 200 RSHs will add to the 187 (Army 126, IAF 61) light utility helicopters (LUHs), in the 3-tonne class, being built by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) in another long-delayed project.Progressive induction of these new LUHs will see the Army finally begin to retire its old Cheetahs and Chetaks from 2027 onwards, with the entire retirement-induction plan taking around a decade, an officer said. A separate `Make in India’ project for 60 Utility Helicopter-Marines for the Navy, incidentally, is also yet to take off.It’s, however, very early days for the RSHs. The Army itself said the RFI has been issued to finalise staff qualitative requirements, decide the procurement category and identify probable vendors, including Indian companies forming joint ventures or production arrangements with foreign original equipment manufacturers.While the Cheetahs and Chetaks have certainly been the workhorses of the 14-lakh strong armed forces, especially in high-altitude and forward areas, they have also grappled with poor serviceability and maintainability.The Cheetahs lack modern avionics and glass cockpits that assist in stability augmentation and build better situational awareness for the pilots to operate in low visibility and bad weather conditions.Officials are keeping their fingers crossed this time. For instance, the inter-governmental agreement inked with Russia in 2015 for 200 twin-engine Kamov-226T choppers for Army (135) and IAF (65) in a `Make in India’ project worth around $2 billion, eventually failed to take off due to pricing and other issues.","The Army on Friday issued a request for information to vendors for the acquisition of 120 reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters.

Today's evening news wrap includes updates on national politics, foreign affairs, business and international security. An SBI report revealed that India's fuel bill may rise by $ 12 billion in FY27 if it stops Russian oil. Centre withdrew Income Tax Bill in Lok Sabha and the new Bill is set to be introduced on August 11. The Election Commission has asked Rahul Gandhi to sign declaration on ""vote chori"" claim. Meanwhile, the US reiterated its ""direct involvement"" claim in India-Pakistan ceasefire. Israel approved plan to take control of Gaza City.According SBI analysis, discontinuing Russian oil imports for the remainder of FY26 could result in a $9 billion increase in the fuel bill during FY26, whilst FY27 might witness an escalation of $11.7 billion owing to price rises.Since 2022, India has sharply increased purchases of discounted Russian oil, priced under a $60-per-barrel cap. The move, adopted after Western sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine invasion, was aimed at bolstering the country’s energy security amid shifting global supply lines.

Finland-based thinktank exposes US double standard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finland-based-thinktank-exposes-us-double-standard/articleshow/123151870.cms,"NEW DELHI: European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports against India's 13% since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, while G7+ tankers are currently transporting more than half of those barrels, data published by CREA (Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air) shows.Indian govt sources here said this further spotlighted Western hypocrisy in targeting India for securing its energy interests, while ignoring similar action by other countries. European Union has been procuring not just energy but also fertilizers, chemicals, iron, steel and transport equipment from Russia.""These figures only vindicate India's emphasis on ensuring for its citizens regular and affordable energy supplies,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.Seen in the backdrop of the US on Wednesday doubling tariff on India to 50% for ""fuelling the Russian war machine"" by buying its oil and last month's EU sanction on Indian refining entity Nayara Energy, the Finland-based independent think-tank's latest report exposes what New Delhi describes as West's ""double standard"" in singling out India.The report says Moscow has raked in EUR 923 billion (92,300 crore) so far from fossil fuel exports such as oil, natural gas, coal, refined fuels and intermediaries.Of this, EUR 212 billion (21,200 crore) came from EU countries compared with EUR 121 billion (12,100 crore) from India. China remained the top bu-yer of Russian energy with a tab of over EUR 200 billion (20,000 crore).The report points out the growing role of G7 tankers in transporting Russian oil since the EU's June sanctions. This underlines the disconnect between western policy and practice pointed out by New Delhi. ""Since Jan, the G7+ share in Russian oil transport has increased from 36% to 56%,"" it says. More than half of Russian seaborne oil exports were transported in G7+ tankers in June, reflecting a six percentage point increase over May.Use of western tanker fleet means those shipments were compliant with the price cap and other terms of the sanctions. India argues it has helped prevent a flare-up in oil prices by buying Russian oil, accounting for about 9% of daily global supply. That is also the key consideration that led the US and the EU to opt for a price cap - rather than choking off the flow with sanctions - for curbing funding for Moscow's war efforts without spooking the oil markets.Overall, however, the report does say that ""Russian fossil fuel revenues in second quarter of 2025 dropped by 18% year-on-year - lowest in a quarter since the invasion of Ukraine. This occurred despite an 8% increase in volumes exported in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025.""Read | Trump tariffs: Exporters on edge, fear losing orders","European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports.

"Niti withdraws paper on GM crops import from US, signals govt stand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/niti-withdraws-paper-on-gm-crops-import-from-us-signals-govt-stand/articleshow/123196591.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Niti Aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper, which had suggested opening up import of genetically modified (GM) soybean and corn from the US, has given a peek into India's red-line on transgenic food items.Though the US, during its trade negotiations with India, considered the stand as one of the non-tariff trade barriers, India preferred not to open up its market for GM food items over biosafety concerns, notwithstanding its primary think tank arguing in favour of import of transgenic soybean and corn without harming domestic production.The working paper on 'promoting India-US agricultural trade under the new US trade regime', released in May, had suggested that GM corn may be imported for ethanol blending and its by-products, like Distiller's Dried Grains with Solubles. ""US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India's biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,"" said the authors - Raka Saxena and Ramesh Chand - of the working paper. Chand is member, Niti Aayog, while Saxena is senior adviser at the think tank.Although the paper used a disclaimer terming the content as personal views of authors, its recent withdrawal from the think tank's website reflects govt's thinking on the issue of GM products.India currently allows commercial cultivation of only transgenic cotton, a non-food farm item.Govt's stand is in sync with RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch's opposition to the cultivation and import of GM farm products. In its opposition to transgenic food items, the SJM has even joined hands with several left-leaning farm groups in the past.The working paper had pitched for a ""dual-track"" approach while negotiating the trade deal on agricultural items with the US and appeared keen on opening the country's market to specific non-sensitive imports of farm products that do not face direct competition from local producers, such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.India has maintained a surplus in agriculture trade with the US and it has increased over time. India's agricultural exports to the US grew nearly fivefold between 2004 and 2024, from $1.18 billion to $5.75 billion, while imports however, grew faster - from $291 million in 2004 to $2,218 million in 2024.","The Niti Aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper, which had suggested opening up import of genetically modified (GM) soybean and corn from the US, has given a peek into India's red-line on transgenic food items.

On his demand that EC share the electoral roll in a ""machine-readable format"", the officer cited SC's rejection of a similar prayer by Congress' Kamal Nath in 2018.""In 2018, they tried to mislead SC by producing documents from a private website to demonstrate that the roll showed the same face for 36 voters.

Though the language is altered, its substantive content - criminalising vague and broad categories of speech and expression such as 'subversive activity', 'encouragement of separatist feelings', and acts 'endangering unity or integrity of India' - remains the same or is even more expansive. "" He was among petitioners who challenged the validity of the IPC section earlier.On April 23, 2023, a bench led by then CJI D Y Chandrachud had referred to a five-judge bench to decide the validity of the sedition provision under IPC Section 124A after rejecting govt's plea to pause judicial scrutiny and await Parliament's view on the proposed new penal code in BNS.On May 11,2022, a bench headed by then CJI N V Ramana had suspended operation of the sedition provision to stop police from invoking it against anyone and also stayed both probe and trial in existing sedition cases to allow the Centre to examine pruning the rigour of Section 124A. ""We expect that, till the re-examination of the provision is complete, it will be appropriate not to continue the usage of the aforesaid provision of law (Section 124A) by govts,"" the CJI Ramana-led bench had said.In the Kedarnath Singh case in 1962, SC had read down the provisions of Section 124A . ""It is only when the words, written or spoken, etc. which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order that the law steps in to prevent such activities in the interest of public order.

According to the regulation, NMC's Ethics & Medical Registration Board shall maintain the NMR, which shall contain entries of all doctors in all state registers maintained by state medical councils. The regulations envisage a unique identification number for every doctor, centrally generated by EMRB, which will ""grant registration in NMR and eligibility to practice medicine in India"".All existing medical practitioners enrolled in the Indian Medical Register or the State Medical Register not having registration number as per the regulation were mandated to update their registration in the web portal of EMRB within three months of publication of the regulation.However, applications have petered out as approvals for 90% of those who applied are still pending. From 6,000 applications in the first three months after launch, applications have dwindled to less than 800 in past four months.The renewal of registration every five years is supposed to happen through state councils and the status of registration in the state registry ""shall automatically reflected (sic) in the National Register"".

No approvals needed for MSMEs up to Rs 125 Cr: Kejriwal

From ‘exploitative’ past to participatory governance

Industrial bodies asked to submit draft policies by October 2

NEW DELHI: AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday launched 24 sectoral committees aimed at transforming Punjab’s industrial governance model. The committees will be responsible for drafting policies for each sector, shifting decision-making power from the bureaucracy to business owners, both large and small.“Policies will now be made by small and large business owners themselves; the government will implement them,” Kejriwal said at the launch event in Chandigarh. “True politics of AAP is handing power back to the people — it’s about participation, not control.”Each committee will include MSME representatives, larger businesses, and officials from the Punjab Bureau of Industrial Investment and District Industry Centres. According to CM Bhagwant Mann, the idea was proposed during government-industry consultations held in September 2023.Kejriwal highlighted new measures to ease regulatory hurdles for industries in the state. “Now, deemed approvals are being granted in 45 days in Punjab, and investments up to Rs 125 crore by MSMEs need no approval at all,” he said.He claimed that this model represented a break from previous regimes.“Earlier, the system in Punjab punished entrepreneurs for their growth — they were threatened and extorted,” he added.Describing the transition in phases, Kejriwal said, “Before 2022 – A corrupt, exploitative system inherited by AAP. 2022–2025 – The reform phase under an honest government. Now – A revolutionary model of governance led by industry.”“We don’t know how to run a textile unit or manufacture sports equipment. Nor do the officers. But still, politicians take all decisions, and people run around us,” he said. “That system is now gone.”Kejriwal urged industry stakeholders not to focus on subsidies. “Subsidies aren’t sustainable. If profit depends on them, the day subsidies stop, so does profit,” he said, calling for innovation and ease of doing business instead.The sectoral committees are expected to study national and international policies and submit their sector-specific drafts by October 2. “Make Punjab the most attractive state for investment in each sector. This is a new governance model — the government is stepping back to let people lead,” Kejriwal said.Mann echoed the sentiment, stating that the AAP government was committed to reversing Punjab’s economic decline. “Previous governments looted Punjab, but the AAP government will realize the dream of making Punjab vibrant again,” he said.Kejriwal, responding to criticism around delayed approvals, added: “Some say if you delay approvals, people will come back with bribes, and that’s how party funds are raised. But we don’t want that. Our only goal is Punjab’s development.”","AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann launch 24 sectoral committees aimed at transforming Punjab’s industrial governance model.

New green card rules for non-citizen children in US: How will it affect Indians?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-green-card-rules-for-non-citizen-children-in-us-how-will-it-affect-indians/articleshow/123196395.cms,"USCIS issues new rule for age calculation of a child seeking green card along with parents.

How will it affect Indian families?







The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a new rule for age calculation of non-citizen children applying for a green card on their parents' petitions. It stated that, starting from August 15, the Final Action Date will be used for calculating the child's age instead of the current rule of considering the Dates for Filing. This means more children will age out soon.An unmarried alien child must be under age 21 to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States based on their parent’s approved petition for a family-sponsored, employment-based, or diversity visa. If they turn 21 and age out during the immigration process, they generally are no longer eligible to immigrate based on their parents’ petition.The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) helps certain children remain eligible for a Green Card past their 21st birthday, protecting them from “ageing out” due to long processing delays.In February 2023, USCIS expanded this protection by allowing the Dates for Filing chart, often years ahead of the Final Action Dates chart, to determine when a visa is “available” for CSPA purposes.

Amid the intense anti-H-1B sentiment in the US, Republican senator Greg Murphy was trolled on X after he said H-1B visas are critical to address the physician shortage in the country. He said rural communities can't find US doctors, and foreign medical graduates are the only ones who treat those patients.""H1-B Visas are critical for helping alleviate the severe physician shortage this nation faces.

India's SAVAGE CLAPBACK Embarrasses Trump On Global Stage; Truth Bombs Amid Tariff Bullying





CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins roasted Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro over the answer Navarro gave on why the president singled out India to impose additional tariff as India buys Russian oil while China also does the same. Navarro gave an answer and then said he gave a ""really good answer"", but back in the studio, Collins asked former ambassador John Bolton, Trump's NSA between 2018-2019, whether Navarro actually gave a good answer.""China buys more Russian oil than India does, and they have not been targeted for that. So why is India having its tariffs doubled?"" Collins asked Navarro.""As the boss says, let’s see what happens. Keep in mind that we have over 50 percent tariffs on China already,"" Navarro said.Collins then countered Navarro and said China's tariff could go up higher as a punishment for buying Russian oil going beyond the existing 50 per cent tariff.""So we don’t want to get to the point where we actually hurt ourselves,"" Navarro said, patting himself on his back for giving a good question.""And I think I’ve given a really good answer to that. We’ve got tariffs 50 percent — we already have high tariffs on China. So, I take your point.President certainly will be working with China on that issue,"" Navarro said.Collins played the video and asked Bolton whether Navarro's answer was really good.""That shows exactly what I think could be the worst outcome for the United States, that India has reacted very negatively, as you might expect, to these tariffs related to Russian oil purchases, in part because they see that China has not been tariffed,"" Bolton said.""And Trump seems to be, in the minds of many China experts, setting up to treat China more leniently than he has treated India, thus putting in jeopardy decades of American effort, to bring India away from Russia, to bring India away from China, to join us in trying to push back on Chinese efforts, to gain hegemony along its long Indo-Pacific perimeter.""""And the irony here is that while the secondary tariffs against India are intended to hurt Russia, it could push India back closer to Russia, and ironically closer to China, perhaps negotiating together, against the US tariff efforts,"" Bolton said.","CNN's Kaitlan Collins roasted Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro over the answer Navarro gave on why the president singled out India to impose additional tariff.

"Anand Mahindra reacts to Trump’s tariffs: ""India should seize this moment like 'Amrit' from a global Manthan""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/anand-mahindra-reacts-to-trumps-tariffs-india-should-seize-this-moment-like-amrit-from-a-global-manthan/articleshow/123166411.cms,"Reforms, not reactions: What Anand Mahindra suggests India must do

Unleashing the power of tourism as a forex engine

A broader economic agenda for resilience and growth

Learning from unintended global consequences

Turning adversity into advantage

In the wake of US President Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on Indian imports, industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India. Drawing a powerful analogy from Indian mythology, Mahindra urged the nation to extract 'Amrit', opportunity and growth, from the 'Manthan' or global churn caused by escalating trade wars. He emphasized that instead of viewing the tariffs as a setback, India should treat them as a catalyst for internal reforms, economic acceleration, and a repositioning of its global image as a trusted investment destination.According to Mahindra, incremental reforms are no longer sufficient. He emphasized the need for India to radically improve its ease of doing business, beginning with a truly functional single-window clearance system for all investment proposals. While acknowledging that states control many investment-related regulations, he proposed forming a coalition of willing states that align with a central national platform to demonstrate India’s ability to move with speed, simplicity, and predictability.Such measures, Mahindra believes, will not only help neutralize the impact of tariffs but also transform India into a magnet for global capital. In a world where trusted partnerships are in high demand, India has a unique opportunity to present itself as a dependable, long-term destination for investors.Mahindra also flagged tourism as a massively underutilized asset in India’s economic strategy. He called for the urgent need to accelerate visa processing, improve infrastructure for foreign visitors, and create dedicated tourism corridors around existing hotspots. These corridors, he said, must prioritize security, sanitation, and hygiene to attract international travelers and serve as templates for other regions.Tourism, Mahindra argued, has the potential to generate enormous foreign exchange, boost local employment, and revitalize India’s image on the world stage if treated as a strategic sector.Mahindra did not stop at investment and tourism. He laid out a broader framework aimed at ensuring long-term economic resilience. Key priorities include liquidity support for MSMEs, acceleration of infrastructure investment, and a manufacturing push through the enhancement and expansion of the PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) schemes.He also urged policymakers to rationalize import duties, especially those on raw materials and components critical to manufacturing, to help make Indian products globally competitive.In his remarks, Mahindra highlighted how other countries are using the global tariff war to address long-standing economic inefficiencies. Germany, for example, is rethinking its fiscal orthodoxy, opening doors to greater defense and infrastructure spending, while Canada is making efforts to break down long-standing internal trade barriers.These examples, he suggested, show how external pressure can trigger internal transformation. For India, the question is whether it can also use this moment of global churn to create positive, long-term consequences for its own economy.Mahindra concluded his remarks with a message that balanced realism with optimism. Acknowledging that nations like the US will always prioritize their own interests, he stressed that India should be no different. The goal, he said, should not be to complain but to adapt, reform, and rise. After all, every challenge is just an opportunity in disguise—sometimes wearing a slightly grumpy face. If the world throws tariffs, maybe it's time we throw back innovation.“Just as the 1991 forex reserves crisis triggered liberalization,” Mahindra wrote, “can today’s global manthan over tariffs yield some ‘amrit’ for us?” His call to action was clear: let India use this moment to shape its own destiny intentionally, ambitiously, and decisively.","Industrialist Anand Mahindra has called for a bold and strategic response from India.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Trump's Pakistan Oil Gambit Backfires On Day 1; 'U.S. Being Deceived, No Reserves In Pak' | Watch





Pakistan and Iran agreed on Sunday to increase bilateral trade to USD 8 billion annually, taking advantage of their geography and the ""discount of distance,"" as trade ministers from the two countries held discussions to deepen economic and political ties.The agreement was reached during a meeting between Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade Mohammad Atabak on the sidelines of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's two-day state visit to Pakistan.Pezeshkian landed in Lahore on Saturday afternoon and then flew to the capital in the evening.A statement by the Commerce Ministry here said the high-level discussion between Khan and Atabak marked a renewed commitment from both sides to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors.""[During the meeting], Kamal envisioned that, if fully leveraged, bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran could easily exceed USD 5-8 billion annually in the coming years,"" the ministry said.Before departing from Tehran, Pezeshkian had said Iran and Pakistan have always maintained ""good, sincere, and deep relations"" and plan to increase bilateral trade volume to USD 10 billion annually.During Sunday's meeting, emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Khan highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.""Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don't, we lose both time and cost benefits,"" he stated.The Pakistani minister suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.""We've done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,"" he was quoted in the statement as saying. ""Let's do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.""The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities.Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.""Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,"" he noted.Khan said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of West Asia, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated B2B day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration, the statement said.""With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,"" it added.","Trade ministers from the two countries held discussions to deepen economic and political ties.

On Friday morning, Minneapolis recorded the second-worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, ranking just below Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city’s air quality index (AQI) reached 159, classified as unhealthy for all individuals, meaning even healthy people are at risk of irritation and respiratory issues. This situation was triggered by wildfire smoke drifting south from Canada, creating hazy skies and smoky odors across much of Minnesota. Officials issued air quality alerts statewide, urging residents to limit outdoor activity and take protective measures. The event highlights how wildfire activity thousands of miles away can significantly impact public health and daily life in urban US areas.Massive wildfires in Canada have released thick smoke plumes, carried southward by northerly winds, affecting multiple US states. Chicago’s air quality ranked worst in the world on Thursday before improving to 17th place on Friday. Minneapolis, however, worsened, securing the second spot globally for poor air quality. Some south Minneapolis neighborhoods recorded AQI levels of 170, while Hibbing in northern Minnesota saw the highest at 185, considered highly dangerous. These levels represent fine particulate pollution (PM2.5), which can penetrate deep into lungs and bloodstream.The Midwest experienced widespread impact, with poor air quality reported in Cedar Rapids, Duluth, Eau Claire, Fargo, Kansas City, St. Louis, Wichita, Ashland, Bismarck, Grand Forks, Marquette, Minot, Omaha, Pierre, Superior, Traverse City, and Wausau. States including Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin remained under air quality alerts through Saturday. Millions of residents were exposed to smoke-filled air, prompting health officials to issue emergency guidance and monitor conditions continuously.According to a University of Minnesota study, air pollution causes over 100,000 deaths annually in the United States. Unhealthy air can trigger asthma attacks, cardiovascular stress, eye irritation, and breathing difficulties, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, and those with lung or heart disease. Poor air quality has also been linked to long-term chronic health issues when exposure is prolonged or repeated.The National Weather Service and health experts urged residents to:This air quality crisis underscores the cross-border impact of wildfires and the growing influence of climate change on extreme weather and environmental hazards. Canada’s 2025 wildfire season has already burned millions of acres, prompting multiple provincial air quality alerts in Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. The US situation also comes after rollbacks of more than a dozen pollution regulations, sparking debates about environmental preparedness and public health policy.","Minneapolis recorded the second-worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, ranking just below Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Mark Zuckerberg’s offer and Tulloch’s viral rejection





Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta. A former OpenAI engineer, Tulloch is now the co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab alongside ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. The AI startup, still in its early stages, is already valued at $12 billion. Tulloch’s decision to decline Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment attempt reflects a broader trend of top AI talent prioritizing independence, mission-driven work, and long-term impact over staggering financial packages.Tulloch’s journey began at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with first-class honours and a University Medal in mathematics. He later earned a Master’s in Mathematical Statistics from Cambridge and pursued a PhD at UC Berkeley. Tulloch worked at Meta (then Facebook) from 2012 to 2023, contributing to machine learning systems and the development of PyTorch. He played a pivotal role in making PyTorch one of the most widely adopted frameworks in AI. His impact was felt across Meta’s core AI infrastructure. He joined OpenAI in 2023, focusing on GPT-4 pretraining and reasoning models, before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab in early 2025.Unlike many AI engineers who stay within big tech, Tulloch has consistently sought out roles where he can shape core AI architecture rather than optimize existing systems.Co-founded with Mira Murati, Thinking Machines Lab is focused on building AI systems that are safer, interpretable, and customizable—going beyond traditional chatbot interfaces. The startup, though yet to release a product, has secured a $2 billion seed round with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, AMD, and Google Cloud. Its ambition and leadership have made it a top target for recruitment, especially from Zuckerberg's new ""superintelligence"" division at Meta. The company’s core mission—developing AI that reflects diverse global needs—has created a gravitational pull for talent across the AI world. Tulloch’s name now resonates not just as a coder, but as a leader defining the next chapter in responsible AI innovation. Industry insiders say the startup has quietly attracted talent from DeepMind, Anthropic, and OpenAI—further signaling that it may become a major challenger in the foundation model race.According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg personally tried to lure Tulloch back to Meta with a six-year offer worth up to $1.5 billion, contingent on bonuses and stock performance. Tulloch declined, joining other Thinking Machines Lab co-founders in resisting Meta’s poaching attempts. His decision has sparked widespread praise among AI researchers, many of whom see it as a stand for academic and scientific freedom. The bold rejection has gone viral, with Tulloch’s LinkedIn profile celebrated for charting a rare career driven by principles rather than payouts. Meta later disputed the exact terms of the offer but confirmed outreach efforts were made.","Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta.

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Deitke reportedly felt that joining too early would limit his freedom to experiment—a value he deeply prioritizes in his research philosophy. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted. The story of Deitke’s recruitment has since become symbolic of the escalating talent wars within the AI sector. Zuckerberg’s direct involvement also underscores how central AI has become to Meta’s long-term strategy.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time. His work on Molmo was widely praised across the AI community. It was seen as a major leap toward more human-like machine interaction.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. Molmo was even cited by OpenAI researchers as a benchmark system for cross-modal alignment testing, a rare recognition from rivals in the space. His contributions helped advance embodied and multimodal AI platforms that continue to support reproducible research and shared benchmarks. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Its early prototypes demonstrated impressive capabilities in task automation, sparking interest from enterprise clients and researchers alike. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt Deitke is one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.
