US clears 26/11 Mumbai-attack accused Tahawwur Rana's extradition to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-clears-26/11-mumbai-attack-accused-tahawwur-ranas-extradition-to-india/articleshow/117542183.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: US Supreme Court on Saturday approved the extradition of 2008 Mumbai-attack accused Tahawwur Rana to India.Rana's lawyer had, earlier this month, argued that the Supreme Court should block his extradition based on the interpretation of ""offense"" in the US-India extradition treaty .""The (Supreme) Court should grant the writ. On the merits, it should hold that the term ""offence"" in the double jeopardy provision of the United States-India extradition treaty (and many other similar treaties) refers to the conduct underlying the charges in the two countries, rather than the elements of the crimes the respective countries have charged,"" the lawyer had said.US government had supported India's request for his extradition last year asking the Supreme Court to dismiss ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.A Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, Rana, had appealed to the US Supreme Court to block his extradition. On December 16, US Solicitor General Elizabeth B Prelogar filed a response urging the court to reject his petition.Rana had unsuccessfully appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. In August, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the India-US Extradition Treaty allows Rana's extradition.Rana is linked to Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley, a key conspirator in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. The 2008 terror attack, carried out by 10 Pakistani terrorists, resulted in the deaths of 166 people, including six Americans, and saw a 60-hour siege at several locations across Mumbai.","US Supreme Court approves extradition of 2008 Mumbai-attack accused Tahawwur Rana to India.

Odisha tops in fiscal health: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-tops-in-fiscal-health-report/articleshow/117538948.cms,"NEW DELHI: Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand and Gujarat have emerged as the top performing states in the fiscal health index, compiled by govt think tank Niti Aayog.Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala and Haryana figure at the bottom of the table. The performance of the states have been put under four categories - achievers, front runners, performers and aspirational. Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand and Gujarat are achievers, with higher capital outlay, effective mobilisation of non-tax revenue, creation of revenue surpluses, low interest payments. States under the aspirational category include Kerala, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab. The states under the aspirational category are struggling to meet the fiscal and revenue deficit targets, have low revenue mobilisation and are faced with growing debt burden, and debt sustainability is a concern.The states' performance varies across the five sub-categories. For instance, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have a good score under quality of expenditure but they rank lower with regard to revenue mobilisation, Karnataka has performed well across most indices but it ranks among the three bottom states in terms of debt sustainability. Odisha and Chhattisgarh have performed well under revenue mobilisation category with their own non-tax revenue growing significantly due to high revenue collection from mining. But on debt sustainability, Chhattisgarh ranks lower compared to other states.The Fiscal Health Index (FHI) is aimed at evolving an understanding of the fiscal health of states in the country. The analysis covers eighteen major states that drive the country's economy in terms of their contribution to GDP, demography, total public expenditure, revenues, and overall fiscal stability.""As states are responsible for approximately two-thirds of public spending and one third of total revenue, their fiscal performance is important for the country's overall economic stability,"" according to the report. It further adds that the objective is to evaluate fiscal health of the states through key fiscal parameters, identify fiscal strengths and weaknesses.","Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand and Gujarat have emerged as the top performing states in the fiscal health index, compiled by govt think tank Niti Aayog.

What is Budget halwa ceremony?

Budget 2025 halwa ceremony : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the customary 'halwa' ceremony on Friday, signalling the commencement of the final phase in preparing the Union Budget 2025-26, scheduled for presentation on February 1 in the Lok Sabha. The ceremony takes place in the North Block basement, where the ministry is situated in the national capital, with the finance minister and senior officials in attendance.FM Sitharaman attended the event, inspected the Budget Press facilities, and conveyed her best wishes to the officials involved in the process.The ceremony was attended by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, along with senior officials including Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth, and other high-ranking members of the ministry.The budget session of parliament will begin on January 31 and end on April 4, with an inter-session break from February 14. President Droupadi Murmu will address the joint sitting of two houses of Parliament on January 31.The halwa ceremony is a customary ritual observed a few days before the budget presentation in the Parliament, involving the preparation and serving of ""halwa"" to officials and staff involved in the budget's preparation.Following the halwa ceremony, officials involved in drafting the Budget enter a 'lock-in' period, remaining confined within the North Block premises, cut off from external communication, and prohibited from using mobile phones to ensure that Budget details are not leaked before the official presentation in Parliament.According to an ET report, Budget documents are sent for printing after receiving approval from the Prime Minister, and the Intelligence Bureau conducts surprise inspections of the printing press in the ministry's basement to safeguard the process further.This upcoming Budget Presentation will be Sitharaman's eighth budget, surpassing the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Like the previous few full Union Budgets, Budget 2025 will also be delivered in paperless form.The Budget comes in the backdrop of weak GDP numbers and weak consumption in the economy. The Indian economy grew by 5.4 per cent in real terms in the July-September quarter of the current financial year 2024-25, lower than RBI's forecast of 7 per cent. The Reserve Bank, in its latest monetary policy, had cut India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.6 per cent from 7.2 per cent.The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament earlier this year ""conservatively"" projected India's real GDP growth at 6.5-7 per cent for 2024-25, acknowledging that market expectations are higher. India's GDP grew by an impressive 8.2 per cent during the financial year 2023-24 and continued to be the fastest-growing major economy, growing by 7.2 per cent in 2022-23 and 8.7 per cent in 2021-22.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman attended the customary 'halwa' ceremony on Friday, signalling the commencement of the final phase in preparing the Union Budget 2025-26.

Rapid Increase in Cases The Bacterial Infection Causing It

PUNE: Alerts from three Pune hospitals to local authorities last Monday about a higher-than-usual occurrence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a rare but treatable autoimmune disease, blew up into an unprecedented cluster of 73 cases by Friday - almost trebling in four days from the initial 26 cases that caused alarm. No GBS-induced death has been reported. Although GBS is known to occur in communities, large hospitals typically admit 1-2 cases a month.Fourteen of the patients hospitalised over the past week were on ventilator support as health authorities in Maharashtra started door-to-door surveys, looking for signs of infection and raising awarness about GBS. Officials said municipal and district health workers surveyed about 7,200 homes in two days.Experts said the pathogenic bacteria Campylobacter jejuni was a known trigger for GBS, in which the patient's immune system attacks the nerves. The recent detection of the pathogen in stool samples from multiple hospitals adds to evidence linking this bacteria to the outbreak.Concern about the spread deepened with reports of an infant and a toddler being among new cases. Health experts and doctors suspect the cluster formed on Jan 9, with the first patient to be admitted being an eight-year-old boy.Union health ministry's Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) has taken cognisance of rising GBS cases in Pune and decided to send a team of doctors to assist local authorities. Healthcare facilities, including Sassoon Hospital, are stocking up on injectables and medicines required to combat the outbreak. The hospital is treating 16 GBS patients.Of the 73 GBS patients reported till Friday, 44 are in Pune rural, 11 in Pune Corporation area and 15 in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation belt. The highest number of patients are from Kirkitwadi (14), DSK Vishwa (8), Nanded city (7) and Khadakwasala (6). Three patients are under five, 18 between six and 15, and seven above 60.Dr Babita Kamalapurkar, joint director of epidemiology dept, briefed the CSU about the patient profiles. She said surveyors were telling people that the symptoms to look out for were numbness of limbs and prolonged diarrhoea.","Health authorities in Maharashtra started door-to-door surveys, looking for signs of infection and raising awarness about GBS.

""As a government, we are obviously very much supportive of legal mobility because we do believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have the maximum opportunity at the global level. At the same time, we are also very firmly opposed to illegal mobility and illegal migration,"" Jaishankar had said.""Because you also know that when something illegal happens, many other illegal activities get joined onto it, which is not desirable. It is certainly not good reputationally. So, with every country, and the US is no exception, we have always maintained that if any of our citizens are there illegally, and if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been open to their legitimate return to India,"" Jaishankar added while responding to a query on news reports that India is working with the Trump administration for the deportation of some 18,000 Indians in the US who are either undocumented, or have overstayed their visas.Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Thursday that US authorities arrested 538 migrants and deported hundreds of ""illegal immigrants"" in a day in a large-scale operation, days after President Donald Trump began his second term.Leavitt said on X, ""The Trump Administration arrested 538 illegal immigrant criminals including a suspected terrorist, four members of the Tren de Aragua gang, and several illegals convicted of sex crimes against minors.""During his campaign, Trump pledged to take tougher measures against illegal immigration.

Will take back illegals only after verifying: India to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-take-back-illegals-only-after-verifying-india-to-us/articleshow/117535937.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid concerns raised by the US over irregular migration, India Friday reiterated it will, like in the past, accept illegal migrants from the US only after verifying their Indian origin and that any talk about number of such undocumented people it’s willing to take back is “premature”.The remarks by the ministry of external affairs came shortly after reports from the US said “hundreds” of illegal immigrants were deported in a military aircraft by American authorities just days into Donald Trump’s presidency. More than 500 migrants were also reported to have been arrested. Indian officials said they had no information about this “largest massive deportation operation”.While US authorities were reported last year to have served final order of removal to close to 18000 people for deportation to India, the Indian government has not backed that number maintaining it is yet to be verified by Indian authorities. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) called India “uncooperative” because of the delay in verifying their citizenship.After his meeting with counterpart Marco Rubio, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had said India follows the same policy - facilitating legitimate return of illegal migrants if their Indian origin is validated - with all countries and the US is no exception.“We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime. For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.“If that happens to be the case we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India. Any discussion about the number of people who would be taken back is premature,” he added.“The Trump Administration arrested 538 illegal immigrant criminals…also deported hundreds of illegal immigrant criminals via military aircraft. The largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway. Promises made. Promises kept,” said Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a post on X. Trump has maintained all along that illegal immigration puts an enormous burden on the US and pledged all lawful action at his disposal to address the “crisis”.Speaking after his meeting with Rubio, Jaishankar had also said that while India is aware of the ongoing debate on the issue and the sensitivities involved, India’s position on illegal migration has been consistent and principled.Responding to a query at a media briefing, Jaiswal also said India looks at illegal migration and trade - another likely contentious matter given Trump’s tariff threats - as separate issues and its approach has always been very constructive.“India-US relationship is very strong, multifaceted and the economic ties are something which is very special...We have established mechanisms between the US and India to discuss any matter or trade matters or matters related to trade,” said the official.“Our approach has always been to address issues in a constructive manner which is in keeping with the interests of both countries...We remain in close communication with the US administration,” he added.","India says it will accept illegal migrants from the US only after verifying their Indian origin. Any talk about number of such undocumented people it’s willing to take back is ‘premature’ US authorities reported last year to have served final order of removal to close to 18,000 people for deportation to India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117535976,imgsize-1655441,width-400,resizemode-4/117535976.jpg"

NEW DELHI: All 10 opposition members attending the JPC meeting on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill - two opposition MPs were absent - were suspended for a day on Friday after they accused panel head Jagdambika Pal of arbitrarily changing meeting dates, and not heeding their plea to have the final sessions on Jan 30-31.The members reiterated their demand that the meet for finalising the bill should be postponed from Jan 27, while Pal called their protests ""dilatory tactics"" to delay submission of the JPC report. He said the meet would go ahead on Jan 27, setting the stage for another row on Monday.The suspended MPs are A Raja and Mohamed Abdullah (DMK), Syed Naseer Hussain, Mohd Jawed and Imran Masood (Congress), Kalyan Banerjee and Nadeem-ul Haque (TMC), Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), Arvind Sawant (Sena UBT) and Mohibullah (SP).Later, in a letter to Speaker Om Birla, the MPs alleged that Pal “spoke on the phone with somebody and suddenly ordered suspension”, and asked the Speaker to ensure fair proceedings. BJP accused opposition of seeking to thwart passage of the bill as part of vote-bank politics.The confrontation overshadowed the significant development of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, head of separatist Hurriyat Conference which does not acknowledge Indian sovereignty over J&K, participating in the deliberations in what also marked his first visit outside J&K since scrapping of the erstwhile state’s special status.A clash was expected after opposition, through Raja, sent a letter Wednesday demanding the meetings of Friday and Saturday be pushed to Jan 30-31, as they got no time to collect evidence for moving amendments. The fireworks started right at the start, with opposition protesting the last-minute change in schedule and agenda, announced close to midnight on Thursday, prompting strong retaliation from BJP members who accused them of disruption. Pal told reporters opposition “broke all boundaries”. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey moved the motion for suspending the opposition contingent.Dubey dismissed the charges as hilarious, pointing out that it was opposition MPs who got the last meeting postponed, resulting in it being rescheduled, adding, “Their allegations are just a smokescreen. The fact is that they don’t want the bill to go through for the fear of annoying vested interests among the minority community who are in illegal possession of real estate worth hundreds of billions.”Opposition will attend the meeting Monday if JPC insists on the announced schedule. Opposition MPs said “a comprehensive study” was required by JPC as the issue pertained to large tracts of waqf land and related complex judicial issues. Some members demanded an SC probe, alleging the chairman was “acting at the behest” of higher-ups.Rebutting opposition’s charges, Pal said he tried to answer members’ queries but was faced with sloganeering and use of abusive and unparliamentary words.","All 10 opposition members attending the JPC meeting on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill were suspended for a day on Friday.

NEW DELHI: The opposition MPs, who were suspended on Friday after chaos during a JPC meeting on Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2024, wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla claiming they were suspended after the panel chairman ""spoke to somebody on the phone"".In a letter addressed to the Speaker, opposition MPs recounted the sequence of events, raising concerns about the alleged unilateral and unfair handling of committee proceedings by the chairman. The MPs alleged that their repeated requests to reschedule the JPC meeting were ignored, causing them to rush back to Delhi on short notice, compromising their scheduled constituency programs.""When the meeting started today at 11.00 AM, we the members of opposition vehemently raised our voice with utmost respect against the way of conducting the business by the chairman. We highlighted the unilateral as well as unfair manner of functioning of JPC by ignoring the due process contemplated in the rules,"" the letter stated.""It is respectfully submitted that since the erstwhile served notice scheduled for the meeting on 24th and 25th, we the members designed our programmes in the constituency/states from 27 to 30th as the Parliament Session starts on 31st and thereby prayed for postponement of the 27th meeting.

""The opposition, especially Owaisi ji, believed that Jammu and Kashmir's full representation was not heard, and elected representatives should have been called. Today's meeting, which was scheduled to discuss... was postponed by the chairman based on the opposition's suggestion,"" Dubey said.""However, in front of Mirwaiz, these people created a ruckus, misbehaved, and acted against parliamentary democracy,"" he added.This is not the first time that a JPC meeting on the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024 was concluded in a ruckus.

NEW DELHI: A 27-year search for Reji, a murder convict awarded life term, finally led to her arrest last June. But Supreme Court Friday suspended her sentence and agreed to test whether Kerala HC took the correct call in Sept 1996, saying there is evidence to suggest she may have been a minor while committing the crime on Feb 11, 1990. In 1993, a trial court had acquitted Reji of murdering Mariamma (61), her employer, in Alappuzha's Mavelikkara. The case then went to HC.According to prosecution records, Reji was 18 at the time of committing the murder and she allegedly stole a gold chain and earrings from the victim. The prosecution appealed against the trial court acquitting her, after which Kerala high court on Sept 11, 1996, overturned the order to convict her and awarded life term. However, police drew a blank as she disappeared from her native town immediately after the HC verdict.Police, who only had a 1990 photograph of Reji with them, failed to trace her for 27 years. They said she changed her name, married, had children, and kept shifting her profession and residence to evade arrest - from Kottayam to Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadi to Kothamangalam to Adivad by working as a domestic help and also sales woman in a shop.She was finally arrested on June 25, 2023, at Adivad at Pallarimangalam in Ernakulam's Pothanikkad, where she was living with her family under an assumed name, 'Mini Raju'. Reji movedSC in April last year challenging her conviction, claiming she was a minor at the time of commission of the crime. SC had on Sept 24 last year summoned the trial court records and translated copies of witness depositions. On Friday, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar perused the trial court records.""We are ordering the suspension of her sentence. The trial court would enlarge her on bail pending the adjudication of her appeal after imposing appropriate terms and conditions,"" SC said and posted the matter for final hearing in the third week of Feb.","Reji was convicted of murdering her employer in Alappuzha, Kerala, in 1990.

Fakir told Bandra police that his intention was to commit burglary and not harm the actor.""Shariful claimed that he decided on committing a burglary as he was financially broke due to job loss since Dec 15, 2024. He admitted that had he succeeded in stealing money or valuables from the actor's flat, he would have fled to Bangladesh the same day. He said he had planned his escape route from Meghalaya and crossing Mulki river to Barisal Sardar in Bangladesh,"" a police source told TOI. Last year, Shariful had entered India by crossing Dawki river on the India-Bangladesh border at Meghalaya, paid Rs 10,000 to an agent to have him taken to Assam, and then took a bus to Kolkata, where he stayed for three days before taking a train to Mumbai in May.On Wednesday, police completed the crime scene reconstruction with the recovery of a white plastic bag near Bandra Talao. ""The bag contained various tools including a screwdriver, hammer, hacksaw blade, and a broken knife piece, which the accused had discarded near Bandra Talao, around 1.4km away from Khan's Satguru Sharan building on St Teresa Road,"" said a police officer.During the re-enactment, Shariful demonstrated to the police team his entry method: scaling a 4-ft wall to enter Satguru Sharan premises, using a ladder to climb 12ft to access the duct, reaching the fourth floor where he cut the rat mesh with a knife. He then used the staircase to reach the 10th floor, from where he climbed through the duct pipe to enter the bathroom in Khan's 11th floor flat. He used the same route to escape. He showed police that he used the same duct from fourth floor to scale down before he jumped 12ft after noticing that the ladder was missing.The probe team visited multiple locations with Shariful, including Bandra Talao, his Khar sleeping spot, Bandra station, Dadar and Worli-Koliwada, where they documented statements from the salon worker who cut his hair. ""Police analysed footage from over 650 CCTV cameras, both private and govt-owned...,around three dozen recordings distinctly show his presence in the area and his movements, which serve as crucial evidence,"" said an officer.Shariful will be produced before Bandra court on Friday.To date, police have recorded actress Kareena Kapoor Khan's statement, who described the intrusion as frightening and confirmed no valuables were stolen from the 11th floor flat. Seven staff members and autorickshaw driver, Bhajan Singh Rana, who ferried Saif to hospital have also provided statements.

If we have environmental pollution outside, equally serious social media pollution exists inside,” Kumar said.The conference saw the formation of a working group for Election Management Bodies (EMBs) to collectively address challenges arising from artificial intelligence, social media, and cybersecurity. The "" Delhi Declaration 2025 ,"" adopted during the event, reflects EMBs’ commitment to free, fair, and inclusive elections while fostering innovation and integrity.Kumar criticised the role of social media algorithms, claiming they often amplify one-sided views and promote misinformation. “Big-tech entities should ensure social media algorithms seek to clarify and inform rather than distort and misinform,” he said. He added that relying solely on fact-checkers to combat fake content was insufficient.""Social media algorithms are designed in a way that repeatedly presents content aligned with existing views, reinforcing a perspective without exposing the person to the other side of the argument.

NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference supremo Farooq Abdullah on Thursday joined a group of singers to perform the devotional song, ""Tune Mujhe Bulaya Sherawaliye, Main Aaya Main Aaya Sherawaliye.""The NC leader was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra. He was seen donning a traditional red-coloured scarf associated with the shrine.During the event, Abdullah addressed the contentious issue of the ropeway construction project in Katra, voicing his support for local residents protesting against it. He targeted the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board for proceeding with the project without adequately considering the interests of the community.""Those running the shrine's operations should not take actions that harm the interests of the local people or create problems for them,"" Abdullah said. He praised the residents of Katra for their resilience in opposing the project, saying, ""You showed courage and fought bravely to stop it. They have realised that power lies with the people, not the government.""Former J&K CM also highlighted the power of collective action, pointing out that the people have the ultimate authority to shape or dismantle governments. He mentioned that officials are now consulting the community to determine a more suitable location for the ropeway.He also expressed concern for locals who rely on the shrine for their livelihood. ""The people living in these hills come here to earn their livelihood with the blessings of Mata, but they have been forgotten. Those in power think they are everything, but they are not. When the power of God prevails, all else fades. Just look at what is happening in California,"" he said.Abdullah also mentioned the universality of religious teachings, saying that all faiths share common core values but are often misused by individuals for personal gain.","Farooq Abdullah was attending a religious event at Mata Vaishno Devi shrine at Jammu's Katra.

"‘Indigenous’ bullet trains to run on Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow “indigenous trains”, with a maximum design speed of 280 kmph, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two “indigenous” high-speed trains by the end of 2026. These trains will have the Vande Bharat base and will be designed to run on standard gauge tracks.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains , which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even, when our own high-speed trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the indigenous trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, would meet the expectation of passengers.","The Indian Railways’ Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory has awarded the tender to BEML to manufacture two ‘indigenous’ high-speed trains by the end of 2026.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

American Birthright citizenship curtailed even for legal immigrants: Over 1 million Indians in green card queue impacted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/citizenship-by-birth-curtailed-even-for-legal-immigrants-over-1-million-indians-in-green-card-queue-impacted/articleshow/117419508.cms,"Poll What’s Your Biggest Concern About the Recent Executive Order? Legal Challenges and Constitutionality Impact on Legal Immigrants

Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship, other immigration actions

President Donald Trump’s executive order (EO) - ‘Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship ,’ has left the Indian diaspora stunned. Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants. The overarching belief of many Indian families was that documented (legal) immigrants like the H-1B holders, or those on other work visas like the L (intra-company) visa, or even a F (student) visa, would not be impacted. They are in for a rude shock.More than a million Indians who are in a decades-long queue for an employment-linked green card will be impacted going forward, as a child born in a family (thirty days from the date of the EO) where the mother is here lawfully but temporarily (eg: as a visitor or on a non-immigrant visa – be it a dependent visa like H-4 or even a work visa) and the ‘father’ is not a green card holder or US citizen will not get automatic American citizenship.The Times of India, in its edition dated November 7, 2024, was one of the few newspapers to correctly predict this plan of action. We had said, that if the EO is signed, it would spell a huge set-back for the Indian diaspora, as at least one parent would be required to be a US citizen or green card holder.According to an analysis of the US Census (2022) done by Pew Research, the US was home to about 4.8 Indian Americans, of whom 34% or 1.6 million were born in the US (and became American citizens by virtue of birth).The proposed plan of action is now a reality. Currently, those children who are not born in the US, and whose families are caught in the decades long green card backlog have to self deport on turning 21 or have to opt for another visa – say an international student visa. Citizenship by birth at least gave Indian couples waiting endless in queue for a green card a breather, If their child was born on American soil.Trump’s executive order points out that the 14th Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the US. It has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the US but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’In the context of legal immigrants, it adds: “The privilege of US citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the US: When the mother’s presence in the US at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the US under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident (which means a green card holder) at the time of said person’s birth.”According to immigration attorneys ‘citizenship by birth’ is enshrined in the 14th amendment to the US constitution. The first lawsuit challenging this executive order has been filed by immigration right activists such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others.Cyrus D. Mehta, New York based immigration attorney told TOI: “If both parents are in the US in a non-immigrant status, such as in H-1B and H-4 (dependant visa) status, under Trump’s EO the State Department will not issue a US passport to the child as they are no longer regarded as ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’. This EO will obviously be challenged in court, but I can see the Trump administration taking this all the way to the Supreme Court in the hope that the majority of conservative justices could agree with Trump’s new interpretation of the 14th Amendment.”“If the courts agree with Trump’s interpretation, going forward children of H-1B and H-4 non-immigrants who are born in the US, will not be recognized as US citizens. There is a ripple impact. Many Indians are caught in 100 year employment-linked green card backlogs, and so their only hope was for their child born in the US to sponsor them, when he/she attained 21 years. Now this will not be possible”Also read: Hiring freeze could lead to immigration processing delays, say experts Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskin Susser, an immigration law firm, said: “The unconstitutionality of this is stunning. The term ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ was never intended to apply to those targeted by the EO. It was meant to apply to diplomats who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the US. This is going to be litigated and I predict it will be enjoined before it is effective in 30 days. But obviously there's no guarantees here,”Fiona McEntee also pointed out the gender-play here, “And yes, the EO uses the terms father and mother because obviously every child is born into a family with a mother and father!!!!”Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney told TOI, “The phrase ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ has been consistently interpreted to include nearly all individuals born on US soil, irrespective of their parents’ immigration status, other than children of enemy occupiers or diplomats. A landmark Supreme Court case reaffirmed this interpretation, granting citizenship to a child born in the US to Chinese immigrant parents who were not US citizens. This decision established a precedent which leaves little room for reinterpretation.”The fate of children who have non-citizen, non-green card holder parents now vests with the US courts.","Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants.

Pete Alonso’s Future Takes a Wild Turn—Could LA Be His New Home?



Pete Alonso & Blue Jays closing in on deal, has Mets position changed? | Baseball Night in NY | SNY

MLB Notebook: Padres, Michael King, Roki Sasaki, Dodgers, Jack Flaherty, Angels, Pete Alonso, Mets

Ladies and gentlemen! Just when we were ready to predict how the Pete Alonso free agency would unfold, in waltzes the Los Angeles Angels . The New York Mets have been the favorite for many months to re-sign their powerhouse first baseman. Then numbskull Angels stepped out of nowhere, believing they honestly belonged to the race for the player and feeling they were about to offer a strong enough—$100 million, four-year deal to acquire Alonso.A lot of people are still scratching their heads, wondering how such a large, albeit lucrative, deal can be handed to Alonso, a year after MLB Enter Marc Luino, who expressed doubt as to what market value could ever possibly allow him to fetch such a sum. Remember when outfielder Anthony Santander inked a five-year pact with the Blue Jays? That was the line, and Alonso's worth has been measured against it. Angels are believed to have no limits. They are ready to go all in, and one can tell they are trying to bring a different angle down on their forgettable season of 2024.Now about the dismal days of 2024, the Angels, with a sordid eye-drop season and a decade's worth of vacation-less postseason, turned back onto their fortunes. In its most unexpected shape, an off-season has seen itself begin with 12 free agents they recently signed. Twelve! And this is no addition that came very much remotely easily, in sports that are deemed a bit of a contorted dance when it comes to making competitive adjustments. Many a free-agent signing spells camaraderie across the opportunities that the team can rein in this season. However, one of the glaring needs remains an impactful bat to strike with Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon. Enter Pete Alonso, with his career stats—192 homers and 499 RBIs in just five seasons—practically screaming ""missing piece.""Hence, could Pete Alonso turn the tide for the Angels before they come out of the 2024 crash? Indeed. Just picture a team with Trout, Rendon, and Alonso in the lineup. Then the magic starts happening, and a playoff experience is almost certain with a new flavor that fans may delight in dreaming of.Alonso thinks that he is due for a shakeup. According to the Mets, the recent offer might have insulted their home run expert, inviting speculation that Alonso is now ready to seek a fresh start in greener pastures. Now that the Mets are out of the scene, going on proves that he's all set to close the door on what can be called a not-so-nice chapter. Could Toronto be the city he's going to move to? Or are the Angels offering the next chapter of his life in Los Angeles? One thing is for certain: the Angels would undeniably send to the league some bold signals concerning Alonso leading their team. They are just going on and taking a real risk this 2025 season.As the season draws near, the anticipation grows. The fate of Alonso, and potentially the Angels, hangs in the balance.","The New York Mets have been the favorite for many months to re-sign their powerhouse first baseman Pete Alonso.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Ever since the last Union Budget was presented in July 2024, the world has seen significant changes ranging from various elections, global economic slowdown, geopolitical developments, volatile Indian stock markets, etc. Having witnessed all of this, the common man awaits with eager anticipation from the Hon'ble Finance Minister as she gears up to unveil her eighth straight budget. Some of the key expectations that individual taxpayers may have are discussed below.It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals to either spend or save, thereby boosting the overall economy.The full rebate of tax is available up to income limit of Rs 7 lakh currently under the new tax regime. It is expected that this limit can be raised to Rs 10 lakh, offering relief to middle income taxpayers and making it easier for them to manage their finances.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Top tax reliefs FM Sitharaman should consider in Union Budget To protect salaried taxpayers, there is a case in point to increase the standard deduction under the new regime from the current Rs 75,000 to Rs 1,00,000. This increase will help combat inflation and address the higher personal expenses incurred due to changes in work culture, such as working from home, hybrid work, and work from anywhere.n line with the Government's objective of ""Housing for All"" and fostering home ownership, it is suggested that the Government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans under the new default tax regime.To reduce the carbon footprint and move towards clean energy, the Government should reintroduce the deduction provided under section 80EEB (deduction for interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle) and extend it to the new regime as well.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Individual taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to lower tax rates, make new tax regime more attractive, says survey Currently, if a property seller is a resident, buyers must deduct tax at 1% of the consideration if the property value is Rs 50 lakh or more and file a challan-cum-statement, which is a simple and convenient process. However, if the seller is a non-resident, the buyer must obtain a TAN for this one-off transaction, deduct tax at a higher rate, and file a TDS return, which is a cumbersome process. The government should consider introducing challan-cum-statement for non-resident sellers akin to resident sellers to simplify the process.The proposed measures pave the way for significantly improving financial well-being and stimulate economic growth.","It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117520997,imgsize-79430,width-400,resizemode-4/117520997.jpg"

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
