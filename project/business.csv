Will hit back on our terms: Rajnath conveys India’s resolve against Pak terrorism to Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-hit-back-on-our-terms-rajnath-conveys-indias-resolve-against-pak-terrorism-to-australia/articleshow/121636966.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday told Australia that it will strongly retaliate against terrorism emanating from Pakistan on its own terms, without distinguishing between terrorists and their sponsors, and will not be deterred by nuclear blackmail by its western adversary.The stern message on India’s setting a new red line against Pakistan through Operation Sindoor was conveyed during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the Australian deputy PM and defence minister Richard Marles here. “India thanks Australia for its unequivocal support to India’s resolute response against the barbaric act of terror in Pahalgam,” Singh said later.Marles later also called on PM Narendra Modi to mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the India-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership. “Our shared vision for a stable, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific continues to guide our collaboration,” the PM said.During the meeting earlier, the two sides decided to further strengthen their bilateral defence cooperation, including by intensifying and diversifying industrial collaboration, and steadily work together towards their shared commitment for a free and open Indo-Pacific, with an eye firmly on an aggressive and expansionist China.Pakistan’s role in actively aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism, however, was a major focus area. Singh stressed India’s right to respond in self-defence against terrorism, describing recent actions against Pakistan as “measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and responsible”.While the two sides “agreed to work together to combat terrorism in all its forms”, India also stressed that mere condemnation of terror activities was not enough, and all like-minded countries must act against terror facilitators in multilateral fora like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Financial Action Task Force.“Australia was also told that if it expands its defence ties with Pakistan, its military technologies will end up with China. India also said its concerns about the activities of pro-Khalistani elements in Australia should be addressed,” an official told TOI.With defence ties having emerged as an important pillar of the India-Australia partnership, the two countries expressed satisfaction at the growing strategic convergence in different areas.The two countries in November last year had announced an arrangement on air-to-air refueling between their armed forces as part of their expanding military interoperability, while stressing their shared interests in ensuring “stability and security” in the IOR and the larger Indo-Pacific.India already has a military logistics agreement with Australia, which provides for reciprocal refueling, repair and berthing facilities for warships and aircraft, on the lines of the ones it has with other countries like the US, France, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.Moreover, Australia and Japan are regular participants in the top-notch Malabar naval exercise, which began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992 but includes all “Quad” countries now.India and Australia are now also stepping up cooperation in information exchange, maritime domain awareness and niche areas like AI, cyber, anti-submarine and anti-drone warfare. “India has also showcased its warship-building capabilities, which can lead to joint production,” the official said.","The stern message on India’s setting a new red line against Pakistan through Operation Sindoor was conveyed during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the Australian deputy PM and defence minister Richard Marles.

Public faith in judiciary gets denuded by corruption among judges: CJI B R Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/public-faith-in-judiciary-gets-denuded-by-corruption-among-judges-cji-b-r-gavai/articleshow/121635924.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the polity still grappling with the sensational incident of discovery of huge amounts of cash at Justice Yashwant Varma’s official residence, CJI B R Gavai has said instances of corruption and misconduct in judiciary adversely impact public faith in the judicial system.Speaking on the topic ‘Maintaining Judicial Legitimacy and Public Confidence’ at the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, “Sadly, there have been instances of corruption and misconduct that have surfaced even within the judiciary. Such incidents inevitably have a negative impact on public confidence, potentially eroding faith in the integrity of the system.”He said legitimacy and public confidence in the judiciary cannot be secured through coercion of command (contempt proceedings) but through the credibility earned by the courts. “Any erosion of this confidence risks weakening the judiciary’s constitutional role as the ultimate arbiter of rights,” he said.Without referring to Justice Varma, who was swiftly inquired into by a three-member judicial panel which in its report found truth in the discovery of cash at the judge’s official residence on Mar 14 night in New Delhi, the CJI said, “The path to rebuilding this trust lies in the swift, decisive, and transparent action taken to address and resolve these issues.”He said every system, no matter how robust, is susceptible to issues of professional misconduct. “In India, when such instances have come to light, the Supreme Court has consistently taken immediate and appropriate measures to address the misconduct,” he said.The CJI said the SC has taken another step to bolster public confidence in the institution through voluntary disclosure of assets by its judges. This enhances transparency and promotes greater accountability and setting an example of ethical leadership, he said.“The Court maintains a dedicated portal where judges’ declarations are made public, demonstrating that judges are willing to subject themselves to a degree of scrutiny, similar to other civil functionaries,” he said.The CJI said though live streaming was done to curb fake news or out-of-context reporting of court proceedings, there are instances where reporters go overboard and give a twist to remarks of judges.“Only last week, one of my colleagues (Justice PV Sanjay Kumar) in a lighter vein counselled a junior counsel on the art of court craft and soft skills. Instead, his statement was taken out of context and reported in the media as, ‘Our ego is very fragile; if you offend it, your case will go out’,” Justice Gavai said, calling out a news article published in a digital media platform dedicatedly reporting court proceedings.In conclusion, he said, “In today’s digital era, where information flows freely and perceptions are rapidly shaped, the judiciary must rise to the challenge of being accessible, intelligible, and answerable, without compromising its independence.”",CJI B R Gavai said instances of corruption and misconduct in judiciary adversely impact public faith in the judicial system.

Supreme Court dismisses Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over Shahdara Gurdwara,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-dismisses-delhi-wakf-boards-claim-over-shahdara-gurdwara/articleshow/121635792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bringing curtains over a 50-year-old dispute relating to Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over a Delhi gurdwara as waqf property, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the Sikh religious place has been in existence since 1947 and rejected the Board’s claim that the property was ‘wakf by user’ since time immemorial.Appearing for the Board, senior advocate Sanjay Ghosh told a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Satish Chandra Sharma that the Delhi HC erred in reversing the concurrent findings of trial court and appellate court that it was a wakf by user. He said, “some kind of gurdwara was built over the mosque”.But the bench said the evidence shows that the gurdwara at Shahdara has been functioning at the suit property since 1947. “Not some kind of gurdwara was constructed as you claim. It is a functional gurudwara. This has been admitted by the witness produced by the Board before the trial court. You should voluntarily relinquish any claim over gurdwara.”The bench dismissed the appeal filed by the Board in 2011 against the Delhi HC’s September 24, 2010, judgment. Interestingly, the matter was taken up for hearing by the SC after a gap of 12 years, the last hearing in chamber being before Justice A K Sikri.The HC judgment by Justice Indermeet Kaur had discussed in detail what ‘wakf by user’ meant by relying on several judgments including one by a division bench of the Lahore HC in 1937 and those of the Supreme Court.The Lahore HC had ruled, ""In the absence of any such intention or declaration, no wakf can be said to have been created. It is true that a wakf can be created by user, but that user too must be preceded by an intention on the part of the owner to create a wakf. If no such intention is established, user alone will not be sufficient to divest the property of its private character."" A stand which is similar to that of the Centre in defence of validity of the Wakf Amendment Act, 2025, before the Supreme Court.In the Shahdra gurudwara case, the HC had said the oral and documentary evidence establishes that the disputed property was a private property. “There is no evidence forthcoming to substantiate the Board's claim that there was a permanent dedication of this property by the owner as waqf; there is not a whisper of this either in the pleadings or in the oral version of the witnesses (produced by the Board).”“A mere bald statement in the plaint that this property was being used since time immemorial as a wakf property was not sufficient to establish this plea… in fact there is a admission by a witness that the said property was used as a gurdwara since partition of the country,” the high court had said.","Supreme Court rejects Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over a Delhi gurdwara as waqf property.

In addition to clean electricity generation, these projects will also be important for building water storage capacity due to accompanying reservoirs.Though the ministry had taken multiple measures, including setting up a single-window portal, to speed up the processes of green clearances in the past few years, the minister's remarks show govt's intent of prioritising projects of strategic importance.","The Centre will fast-track environmental clearances of all pending and proposed projects in the Indus River Basin in J&K.

"3,000 steps to death: A borrowed watch, tattoo, and a vanished bride - Honeymoon horror in hills of Meghalaya",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3000-steps-to-death-a-borrowed-watch-tattoo-and-a-vanished-bride-honeymoon-horror-in-hills-of-meghalaya/articleshow/121625076.cms,"NEW DELHI: It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. With a rented scooter, a borrowed smartwatch, and the kind of wide-eyed excitement the newlyweds carry, Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi set off from Indore to the lush, rain-drenched trails of Meghalaya.On May 22, the couple reached Mawlakhiyat village and began the steep 3,000-step trek to Nongriat - home to the famed living root bridges. They spent the night there, surrounded by clouds and forest silence. The next morning, they checked out of their homestay and vanished.What followed was a slow unraveling of a horror no one had imagined.Their scooter was discovered abandoned on May 24, near a café on the Shillong-Sohra road. Then came days of agonising silence until Raja's decomposed body was found deep inside a gorge near Weisawdong Falls.“There is no doubt it was a murder,” said East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem. “We have recovered a dao. It was new and used for this very purpose.”The body was identified by a tattoo on his hand — “Raja and a lady” — and the waterproof smartwatch he had borrowed from his brother. His wallet, gold jewellery, and four mobile phones were gone.A raincoat, possibly belonging to the couple, was later recovered in Mawkma village, just a few kilometres away.Police are still trying to piece together what happened. “Whether the motive was robbery, vendetta or personal enmity, we need to look for more evidence before drawing any conclusions,” SP Syiem added.The search for Sonam continues with drones, sniffer dogs, NDRF teams and mountaineers combing the thick wilderness. But relentless rain has slowed progress.For Raja’s family, the grief is compounded by frustration. His brother Vipin, who has been aiding in the search, said authorities ignored early pleas to explore the very area where the body was eventually found. He also alleged that misleading information may be hampering the investigation.Adding to the chilling puzzle is a voice recording Raja’s mother received from Sonam on May 23 — the last known contact. In it, Sonam can be heard short of breath, telling her mother-in-law she was trekking to a waterfall and refusing to break her religious fast. The call ended suddenly. That was the last time anyone heard from her.The family has refused to cremate Raja’s body in Shillong. They are bringing him back to Indore so his parents can say goodbye.Their demand is clear: a CBI probe and Army assistance. For now, all they have are questions, empty silence - and a borrowed watch that told the time, but not the end.","Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi set off from Indore to the lush, rain-drenched trails of Meghalaya.

Once all the buildings are complete, there will be enough space for all,” said a source.The message came amid the plan to shift the first set of offices from North Block to the new buildings and amid the govt’s challenge to find enough space as demanded by ministries and departments.Sources said during the meeting, health secretary Punya Salila Srivasatava made a detailed presentation on obesity, with focus on reducing intake of edible oil by 10%, a call given by PM earlier. In the presentation, she shared the estimated number of obese people in India by 2035 and how the problem is more in urban areas and among children going to private schools, sources said.","“The world saw India’s strength (duniya ne humari takat dekhhi),” PM Narendra Modi said as he addressed the Union Council of Ministers on Wednesday.

2.5 crore 'bogus' IDs solve case of vanishing tickets on IRCTC site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-5cr-bogus-ids-solve-case-of-vanishing-tickets-on-irctc-site/articleshow/121606882.cms,"Poll Have you ever experienced difficulty in booking railway tickets during peak seasons? Yes, frequently No, not at all

NEW DELHI: If you have been baffled by how and why railway tickets in certain trains disappear within minutes of the booking window opening even 60 days before the scheduled journey, IRCTC has detected those behind creating this artificial crisis. Only in the past five months, it detected 2.9 lakh suspicious PNRs while analysing ticket purchases done within just five minutes after booking commenced for both general and Tatkal tickets.Top railway officials said between Janand May, they have deactivated 2.5 crore suspected user IDs for booking tickets and put 20 lakh user IDs under revalidation as a part of a special drive. ""A total of 134 complaints have been registered with the national cyber crime portal and over 6,800 disposal email domains have been blocked.

The fraudsters have been resorting to these tactics to book tickets and charge more from unwary passengers.Sources said the problem of all tickets getting booked quickly is confined to certain routes and trains.""So, the focus is on weeding out users who are beating the system.

Learning outcome India's key school challenge: Unesco,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/learning-outcome-indias-key-school-challenge-unesco/articleshow/121632745.cms,"Global study: Few women leaders in edu serious concern

NEW DELHI: Despite achieving near-universal enrolment in primary education, India faces persistent challenges in ensuring learning outcomes and strengthening school leadership, says Unesco's Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2024-25 released on Wednesday, reports .And the problem is not limited to the country.New Delhi: ""Most teachers are women, but few lead"" is the central message of ""Leadership in Education: Lead For Learning"" section of Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2024-25, released on Wednesday by Unesco. The report highlights what is a problem across countries: under-representation of women in leadership positions at all levels of the education system - from schools to education ministries, reports Manash Gohain.Globally, women make up 57% of secondary school teachers, but in most countries the proportion of female principals lags the share of female teachers by at least 20 percentage points. This disparity exists despite growing evidence that gender-diverse leadership correlates with better learning outcomes and more enabling school environment. Similar is the story at the higher education level. While women comprise 45% of higher education faculty, they account for only 30% of leadership roles in universities and colleges.India is no exception to this phenomenon. While women dominate the teaching workforce in primary schools - accounting for over 60% of elementary teachers - their number declines sharply in leadership positions, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels.The report also examines political leadership in the education sector. Between 2010 and 2023, only 27% of education ministers worldwide were women.","Unesco's Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2024-25 released on Wednesday.

"Census to begin April 2026, caste to be part of survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-begin-april-2026-caste-to-be-part-of-survey/articleshow/121632736.cms,"With tech, census data to be out much faster than in past

NEW DELHI: The Census exercise, put on hold over five years ago due to the Covid outbreak, may start on April 1, 2026, ending with the population count to be taken with the midnight of March 1, 2027 as the reference date. The caste of each resident of the country will be recorded, in a first since the decennial headcount of 1931, as part of the exercise, which potentially holds the key to two other decisions of far-reaching significance - delimitation and implementation of women's quota in legislatures.Sources in the home ministry said the Census - the first one to capture data digitally - will follow a schedule similar to Census 2011; it will be held in two phases - the houselisting phase to be conducted non-synchronously over a 45-day period across states and UTs anytime between April 1, 2026 and Sept 30, 2026; followed by the population enumeration phase, which will also record caste this time, between Feb 9 and 28, 2027. The population count will be recorded as on March 1, 2027, followed by a revisional round from March 1 and 5, 2027.The snow-bound areas of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K, along with Ladakh, will undertake population enumeration six months before the rest of India, that is, sometime in Sept 2026, with the midnight of Oct 1, 2026, being their 'non-synchronous' reference date.There was no clarity on whether National Population Register updation will be done along with the population enumeration phase, like it was done in 2011.The intent to conduct Census after 15 years is bound to be welcomed by policymakers and beneficiaries alike. The exercise is an important data-source for delimitation and reservation of constituencies across all three tiers of govt. It provides a snapshot of the country's population at a given point of time and forms a critical input for planning and formulation of policy initiatives. Census tables also aid research in fields like demography, economics, anthropology, sociology etc.Since the upcoming Census will embrace the digital mode - with respondents free to self-enumerate or have the enumerators capture data on their phones or tablets through the Census app or portal - govt sources said the tables relating to various data fields captured will release much sooner than the earlier decadal counts involving a lag of 5-6 years. A senior functionary said caste data may be released in three years. However, it is unlikely that the caste count by itself will form the basis for reservation.Though a countrywide socio-economic caste census was done in 2011, it returned around 46 lakh castes, with inaccuracies that kept the data from being made public. In recent years, Bihar, Karnataka and Telangana have undertaken their own caste surveys.Census 2027 may also fulfil the condition set under the delimitation law, for being the basis for the next delimitation, which is crucial not only to decide the representation of states/UTs in Lok Sabha but also for implementing 33% reservation for women in LS and state assemblies. As per the law, the next delimitation exercise must be conducted based on the first Census to be undertaken after 2026, though no day or month has been specified.The home ministry on Wednesday said the notification regarding the intent to conduct Census 2027 will tentatively be issued on June 16. Refresher training of enumerators and Census staff may follow; sources did not rule out a fresh pre-test, last conducted in Aug-Sept 2019, in view of digitisation of the process and adding of new data fields like caste.Though only Rs 574 crore was allotted for Census - set to cost over Rs 13,000 crore, along with NPR updation - in 2025-26 Budget, govt sources said finding additional resources was not an issue.Five states/UTs - West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry - are due to go to the polls in May-June 2026 but will have the flexibility to choose a 45-day houselisting schedule anytime between April 1 and Sept 30 to avoid a clash.","The caste of each resident of the country will be recorded, in a first since the decennial headcount of 1931.

Amid a clamour for legislative revamp of the judges-selecting-judges system, fuelled by Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar's statements, CJI B R Gavai has said no reform in the collegium system could be at the ""cost of judicial independence"" and that judiciary should retain its primacy in appointments to Supreme Court and high courts.At a round-table in UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, ""There may be criticism of the collegium system, but... judges must be free from external control.""CJI said SC had struck down National Judicial Appointments Commission Act in 2015 as the law attempted to dilute judiciary's independence by giving primacy to the executive in court appointments.Tracing the evolution of the collegium system through two SC judgments in 1993 and 1998, the CJI said the executive had the final say in appointment of judges to Supreme Court and HCs till 1993 and that system saw two senior-most judges of SC getting superseded in the appointment of CJIs (both by the govt headed by Indira Gandhi) in breach of established traditions.He said the collegium system evolved as judiciary's response to the executive's excesses and unwarranted interference in appointments to constitutional courts.As per the two judgments concerned, the collegium was to act in unanimity and its decision was to be final, Justice Gavai said, adding that this ""sought to ensure independence of judiciary, reduce executive interference and maintain judiciary's autonomy in its appointments"".Quoting B R Ambedkar's words - ""our judiciary must both be independent of the executive and must also be competent in itself"" - the CJI said the fact that constitutional courts drew salaries from the Consolidated Fund of India made judges independent of the executive.Referring to Kesavananda Bharati judgment of 1973 that propounded the basic structure doctrine by a 13-judge bench through seven to six majority, CJI Gavai said, ""This ruling established a significant judicial precedent, affirming that certain fundamental principles, such as democracy, rule of law, and the separation of powers, are inviolable and cannot be altered.""","CJI B R Gavai said no reform in the collegium system could be at the ""cost of judicial independence"" The executive had the final say in appointment of judges to Supreme Court and HCs till 1993.

What more can be done beyond banning select single-use plastic (SUP) items, increasing the thickness of plastic carry bags, and notifying extended producer responsibility (EPR) to achieve the desired results on the ground?

What is an obstacle before developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution? What is India's stand in this context?

What is India’s plan on updating the country’s climate action pledges (Nationally Determined Contribution) and its submission to the UN body?

What would be the impact of the recent Supreme Court decision of striking down retrospective environmental clearances, specifically the 2017 notification and the 2021 Office Memorandum (OM) that allowed post-facto clearances for projects that began without prior approval? What were the ministry’s objectives behind the notification and OM?

India has decided to speed up pending and proposed projects (hydro-power, irrigation canals, and others) in the Indus River Basin in Jammu & Kashmir after keeping the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam terrorist attack. But many of these projects need environmental and other relevant green clearances. Will the ministry fast-track the clearance process to achieve the country’s objective of completing the projects without further losing precious time?

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadavin an interview to TOIresponded to certain questions on critical environmental issues including plastic waste, India's stand on developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, implication of the Supreme Court 's recent order of striking down retrospective environmental clearances and the country's plan to update its climate action pledges ahead of the 30th session of the UN climate change conference (COP30) in Brazil later this year. Excerpts:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that India is determined to reduce single-use plastic and micro-plastic pollution for sustainable development. In order to address the plastic pollution caused by unmanaged and littered plastic waste, the government focuses on two key pillars: banning identified SUP items with low utility and high littering potential, and effective implementation of EPR on plastic packaging. Ban has already been imposed on identified SUP items since July 1, 2022. The “whole of government” and “whole of society” approach adopted for implementation of the ban has led to development of innovative eco-alternatives to banned SUP items and development of new business models.The ministry is continuously taking steps to promote the use of eco-alternatives. State governments and local bodies have been asked to incentivise the manufacture of eco-alternatives. A compendium of manufacturers and sellers of eco-alternatives has been prepared for wider use by citizens. It is a comprehensive document providing detailed information on manufacturing capacities of eco-alternatives and their availability across the country. Local bodies across the country are being encouraged to set up eco-alternatives stores.The mandate for the use of recycled content in plastic packaging has come into force from April 1. This has played a transformative role in moving towards super clean recycling technologies in plastic packaging waste recycling. More than 130 lakh tonnes of plastic packaging waste have already been processed since 2022. The implementation of SUP ban coupled with extended producer responsibility on plastic packaging will lead to a reduction in pollution caused by littered and unmanaged plastic waste.India believes that the success of negotiations at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) mandated to develop a legally binding international instrument on plastic pollution requires consensus-based decision-making with a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation for reaching an agreement on various provisions. We believe that in order to reach agreement the instrument should focus on aspects related to plastic pollution only. Aspects which are not directly related to plastic pollution should not be taken up.We need to strike a critical balance between preventing plastic pollution without affecting the right to sustainable development of developing countries, keeping in view their respective national circumstances. As developed countries have higher per capita generation of plastic waste and have historical responsibility, they need to provide financial and technical assistance by setting up a stand-alone multilateral fund which provides incremental cost for transition to developing countries for meeting compliance obligations.At the outset, I would like to highlight that there are 195 countries, which are party to the Paris Agreement. As per information, 171 countries have not submitted their successive NDCs. This is due to a combination of factors, including capacity constraints in developing countries, need for extensive modelling and studies, and careful consideration of the national circumstances and development needs.A pragmatic approach and careful consideration of national circumstance and development priorities is essential for development of necessary policies to enable ambitious NDCs. For this purpose, the government has initiated a series of studies.The nature of goals under India’s successive NDC will be based on outcomes and subsequent consultations thereon. However, it should be noted that the Paris Agreement casts an obligation on the developed nations to take lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets.The need of the hour is ambitious climate action. For this purpose, the government stands committed and it has been initiating and implementing many schemes and programmes to scale up India’s action on both the adaptation and mitigation across many sectors including water, agriculture, forest, energy and enterprise, sustainability mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy, and resource efficiency, etc.The EIA Notification 1994 and 2006 provided that any new project or activity or expansion/modernization of any activity, covered in its schedule, shall not be undertaken unless it has been accorded prior environmental clearance. However, in practice certain projects, which are otherwise eligible to get Environmental Clearance (EC) under the EIA notification, commenced their projects or activities without prior EC and thus did not get formal EC for their project.A need was felt to bring such projects under the EC compliance mechanism. Initially, a Notification was issued in 2017 and later, in compliance with the directions of NGT in this regard, an OM was issued in 2021. The Supreme Court had on May 16 directed that ECs granted as on date of the order, under the above mentioned notification and OM, shall not be affected. However, no further ECs can be granted under the provisions of the 2017 notification and 2021 OM.The Modigovernment follows ‘whole of the government approach’ in addressing various issues. The ministry will ensure that all the green clearances/regulatory approvals for these strategic projects are granted expeditiously, while ensuring appropriate scientific rigour in the appraisal process.",Bhupender Yadavin answers questions on critical environmental issues including plastic waste.

He will also inaugurate the Anji bridge, India’s first cable-stayed rail bridge, in Reasi district, officials said.The massive developmental push comes at a time when J&K is reeling under the impact of the Pahalgam terror attack and its aftermath.Two days before the PM’s visit, LG Manoj Sinha said the infrastructure boost was aimed at driving J&K’s transformation, enhancing living standards and fostering broader economic participation. “PM Modi has created an inclusive and vibrant future for J&K. It has witnessed a new dynamism in every sector and inclusive growth has ensured no section of society is left behind,” he added.The LG emphasised that the 272-km long USBRL, constructed at a cost of around Rs 43,780 crore, would usher in a new era of development in Kashmir.The rail link, which includes 36 tunnels spanning 119 km and 943 bridges, establishes seamless all-weather connectivity between Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country, driving the region’s socio-economic integration.“This historic railway line will unlock the potential of Jammu & Kashmir and drive unprecedented economic growth in remote areas,” Sinha said, adding “it’s a railway line to the future.”The Chenab bridge, considered an engineering marvel, is part of the USBRL. Built at a height of 359 metres above the River Chenab, it is a 1,315-metre-long steel arch bridge engineered to withstand seismic and extreme wind conditions.“Through Vande Bharat train moving on the bridge, it will take just about 3 hours to travel between Katra and Srinagar, reducing existing travel time by two-three hours,” said an official.PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence in Katra, built at a cost of over Rs 350 crore. It will be the first medical college in Reasi district.Some of the other projects to be inaugurated on June 6 include road networks that will boost last mile connectivity, especially in border areas, officials said. The PM will lay the foundation stone of a road widening project from Rafiabad to Kupwara on NH-701 and the construction of Shopian bypass road worth over Rs 1,952 crore.

As we enter an era defined by AI and deep tech, the time is ripe for India to fast-track innovation. Amid challenges faced by major global economies, India has the right momentum and resources to emerge as a global hub for technological breakthroughs, particularly in data and big data,” he said.Sanjeev Sanyal, member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, emphasized that structural reforms alone are not enough to achieve the aspirations of“We need to go deeper and embrace process reforms. They are essential for improving efficiency, reducing system-level friction, and delivering measurable impact across both government and business operations,” he noted.Adding to the discussion, Mohandas Pai, Chairman of Aarin Capital, highlighted the need to rethink education models to prepare for a quantum-driven future.“Governments must urgently reconsider how we educate the next generation, especially as quantum computing and AI begin to handle tasks traditionally performed by humans,” Pai said.Vic Bhagat, Senior Vice President and Global Advisor at IT infrastructure services giant Kyndryl, pointed to the transformative potential of AI in enterprise technology.“AI’s power lies in its seamless integration with enterprise systems.

NEW DELHI: As an American team touches down in the Capital for negotiating the proposed bilateral trade agreement, government is keeping close tabs on the legal dispute over Trump’s tariffs and the concessions being offered by the US administration to other countries given that the talks are focusing on how both countries can get better market access.The Trump administration is seeking to use the 10% baseline tariffs and the suspended reciprocal tariffs (26% in India’s case) to negotiate trade deals. The court setback, which was stayed a day later, has injected fresh uncertainty, and the government is keen to ensure that it manages to extract the best deal for Indian companies.“What we get compared to other countries will be what we will ultimately finalise in the deal,” a government official said.At the same time, India is conscious of the strategic ties with the US and is looking to step up import of shale gas, LNG, and crude oil from America to diversify its import basket, as prices of these items are lower in the US, an official said. This is expected to help bridge the trade gap of over $40 billion in India’s favour, a major grudge with Trump, who has been doling out various numbers to justify his tariffs actions.How the US administration works out the trade deal will also determine the government’s future course of action on retaliating against some of the tariff hikes introduced by Trump, such as those on steel and aluminium products.“Exports are increasing... there are several things we can buy from the US... For example, shale gas, LNG, crude oil. The more diversified our sources, the greater the benefit for us. Prices are also low in the US,"" the official, who did not wish to be named, said.","The government is keen to ensure that it manages to extract the best deal for Indian companies.

Monsoon Session From July 21 | Govt Refuses Special Debate on Operation Sindoor, Congress Cries Foul

NEW DELHI: The Centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament, expected to commence in mid-July.Govt sources on Tuesday confirmed motion to be introduced in the upcoming session.The move follows a Supreme Court-appointed inquiry panel’s indictment of Justice Varma over allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at his official residence in Delhi after a fire on March 14, 2025.Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju is set to hold consultations with all political parties to build consensus for the unprecedented motion, which, if passed, would mark the first-ever impeachment of a High Court judge in India.Govt sources said that there is a process of forming a panel to investigate the charges against the accused judge before an impeachment motion. However, that formality is not needed since the Supreme Court has already completed the exercise.The controversy erupted when emergency services, responding to the fire at Justice Varma’s residence, recovered a substantial amount of burnt currency notes, reportedly stacked as high as 1.5 feet in a storeroom.A three-member panel, constituted by then-Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna on March 22, 2025, and comprising Justices Sheel Nagu, G S Sandhawalia, and Anu Sivaraman, found credence in the allegations of misconduct.The panel’s report, submitted on May 4, stated that Justice Varma failed to explain the source of the cash, deeming the misconduct serious enough to warrant impeachment proceedings.Justice Varma, who was transferred from the Delhi High Court to the Allahabad High Court following the incident, has denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy. Despite the Supreme Court’s recommendation to resign, he has refused, prompting the government to initiate the impeachment process.Under the Constitution of India and the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, an impeachment motion requires the support of at least 100 Lok Sabha or 50 Rajya Sabha members to be tabled. It must then pass with a two-thirds majority in both Houses. The government, keen on ensuring bipartisan support, has tasked Minister Rijiju with engaging opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, and DMK, to back the motion.The Allahabad High Court Bar Association has welcomed the move, emphasizing the need to uphold public trust in the judiciary.The case has sparked debates on judicial accountability and the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar stressed the importance of legal due process, stating, “Judicial independence must not preclude accountability.”",The Centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament.

'Carrying explosives without declaring': DGCA warns Turkish Airlines to follow rules after surprise checks of its flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/carrying-explosives-without-declaring-dgca-warns-turkish-airlines-to-follow-rules-after-surprise-checks-of-its-flights/articleshow/121628468.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: India has warned Turkish Airlines to comply with all rules after a surprise inspection of its aircraft at four airports over the last one week revealed lapses, including the alleged carriage of explosives without disclosing the same on one flight.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had conducted “safety oversight and ramp (SOFA/RAMP)” inspections of the airline’s passenger and cargo flights at Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Bengaluru from May 29 to June 2, 2025. The operations of Turkish to India will be under the lens as the regulator says it will conduct flow-up inspections “as necessary to ensure continuous safety oversight.”The key lapses found during this surprise “surveillance of foreign (Turkish) aircraft” include: “The cargo contained dangerous goods for which permission is required from DGCA for carriage of explosives to/from over India. This was not found to be attached, nor was it mentioned in the dangerous goods declaration,” according to an aviation ministry statement.The other findings include: “At Bengaluru, the marshaller handling ground operations lacked proper authorisation and a valid competency card for marshalling functions. During the arrival of aircraft, the aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) was unavailable, and the arrival procedure was carried out by a technician instead.Airworks is the authorised engineering service provider for Turkish Airlines,” it added.The check revealed there was no “service level agreement in place between Turkish Airlines and its ground handling agent (GHA). Equipment such as ladders, step ladders, trolleys and ground power units (GPUs) lacked proper accountability and monitoring at Hyderabad and Bengaluru, where Globe Ground India was providing ground services without formal handover from Celebi,” the ministry statement said.“The DGCA emphasises its unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety and regulatory compliance of all foreign operators within Indian airspace. Turkish Airlines has been directed to address these findings promptly and ensure full compliance with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards and recommended practices as well as DGCA regulations. Further follow-up inspections will be conducted as necessary to ensure continuous safety oversight. ”Senior officials say the checks were conducted on Turkish Airlines aircraft operated by the airline and not the two Boeing 777s wet-leased (hired with crew) by IndiGo from it. Turkish and IndiGo each operate a daily passenger flight between Delhi & Istanbul and Mumbai & Istanbul.Following Turkey’s support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and the firing of Turkish drones by Pakistan, New Delhi is reviewing its ties with Istanbul. The security clearance of Turkish ground handler Celebi was withdrawn last month and it had to wind up activities from nine Indian airports. Then the DGCA asked IndiGo to wrap up its wet lease of two Boeing 777s from Turkish by Aug 31, 2025, by giving a “last and final three-month extension. ” This final extension was given after getting an “undertaking from (IndiGo) that they will terminate the damp lease with Turkish Airlines within this extension period, and not seek any further extension for these operations.”",India has warned Turkish Airlines to comply with all rules after a surprise inspection of its aircraft at four airports.

In a major reform announced on April 18, 2022, the UAE Cabinet introduced a revamped Golden Visa system aimed at attracting and retaining exceptional global talent. Among the updates, graduates from the world’s top 100 universities are now eligible to apply for long-term residency visas, commonly known as Golden Visas, allowing them to live and work in the UAE for up to 10 years without a sponsor.The changes are part of the UAE’s wider efforts to transition toward a diversified knowledge economy, as outlined in its Centennial 2071 vision, which places heavy emphasis on science, technology, and entrepreneurship.According to the Emirates News Agency, the new visa policy is designed to “attract and retain global talents and skilled workers” and enhance the UAE’s competitiveness in the global job market.The Golden Visa is open to:Applications from graduates will be evaluated based on:These criteria are aligned with QS World University Rankings, which consider factors like teaching quality, research output, and employability.“The UAE’s visa program shows that university rankings are an important tool for comparing university performance in a global context,” said Leigh Kamolins, Director of Analytics and Evaluation at QS.“It highlights the importance that governments and employers are placing on reputable, quality education for enabling career mobility and driving knowledge economies.”The updated policy also allows Golden Visa holders to sponsor family members, another step toward encouraging longer-term settlement and professional development within the UAE.“The recent changes… mark a shift from immigration based on a sponsorship model to a self-sponsored model,” said Abeer Husseini, Partner at immigration law firm Fragomen.Below is the complete list of the top 100 universities worldwide, whose graduates are eligible to apply for the UAE Golden Visa:","The UAE Cabinet announced a major reform of its Golden Visa system on April 18, 2022.

'Strong and focused agenda': Throne speech adopted without recorded vote in Canada's House of Commons. Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/strong-and-focused-agenda-throne-speech-adopted-without-recorded-vote-in-canadas-house-of-commons-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/121635584.cms,"Steven MacKinnon, Leader of the Government in the House of Commons

What is throne speech?



Who gave throne speech?







The Canadian government adopted the throne speech without a recorded vote, using the ""on division"" method, which means it does not need a vote in the Senate.The House of Commons on Wednesday adopted the government’s reply to the throne speech, according to CBC News.Steven MacKinnon, leader of the government in the House of Commons, posted on social media that this adoption paves the way for a ""strong and focused agenda."" He stated, ""We have a clear mandate to deliver on priorities for Canadians and build a strong Canada — and we're going to do just that.""No MP asked for recorded division on the throne speech when the time to vote came, meaning it was passed without MPs standing to vote.The adoption came despite interim NDP Leader Don Davies announced his party's opposition to the throne speech.Following a caucus meeting, he noted that 1.2 million Canadians elected New Democrats to represent working families, but these priorities were absent from the speech. He criticised the lack of specific details regarding healthcare and housing plans.MacKinnon confirmed this was a confidence vote, marking the first significant test for Prime Minister Mark Carney's government.A lost confidence vote could trigger an early election. Davies acknowledged public reluctance towards an election but maintained his party's position on principle.Green Party Leader Elizabeth May supported the speech, agreeing with its main theme of strengthening Canada, while noting limited attention to climate change. The Conservatives remained uncommitted on their voting stance.The Liberals experienced a setback on Monday when opposition members successfully amended the reply, requiring an economic update before summer recess. Government whip Mark Gerretsen downplayed the 166-164 defeat.The speech emphasises economic growth through expedited national projects and accelerated housing construction. Opposition leaders criticise its vagueness and reliance on rhetoric without clear spending reduction plans.A throne speech traditionally represents a matter of confidence, and its failure could have led to the government's defeat, potentially resulting in a fresh election or the governor general permitting an alternative party to establish governance.The Liberal party, with their 169 seats in the House of Commons, operates three seats below majority government status and requires a minimum of three opposition members to support their legislative proposals and other initiatives for successful passage.King Charles III delivered the Speech from the Throne to open the 45th session of Canada's parliament in Ottawa. In May, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that he had extended an invitation to the King to officially inaugurate Canada's 45th parliamentary session.The timing of his invitation was considered tactical, occurring during a period of tense diplomatic relations between Canada and its influential neighbour, the United States.During his address in Ottawa, Carney emphasised that the King's presence ""clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country"". He stated to the press: ""This is a historic honour that matches the weight of our times.""","The House of Commons adopted the government’s reply to the throne speech.

: An oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 58 lakh to Rs 81 lakh. )It is the first time this portrait has ever been sold at auction as it remained in British artist Clare Leighton’s collection until her death in 1989, after which it was passed down through her family.Leighton, reputed for her wooden engravings, was introduced to Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, she was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. He had travelled to India in 1930 where he met key Independence figures. Afterwards he published the book “Rebel India”, met Gandhi in London in 1931 and introduced Leighton to him. She became one of very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with him to sketch and paint him in 1931.In Nov 1931 Leighton showcased her portraits at the Albany Galleries in London.The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary, Mahadev Desai, wrote a letter to Leighton, a copy of which is attached to the backing board, which reads: “It was such a pleasure to have had you here for many mornings doing Mr Gandhi’s portrait.”According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry states: “We have found no documentation to corroborate this, but the painting shows signs of restoration to what appears to be repaired tears in several places. A label attached to the backing board confirms the painting was restored in 1974 by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory. ”“There is nothing comparable to this painting in existence as it was painted in his lifetime and was a painting that he sat for on multiple occasions,” Rhyanon Demery, head of sale, told TOI.The auction takes place from 7 to 15 July.","Oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000.

"World's richest family 'The Waltons' wealth surpasses the GDP of Greece, Hungary and Iran",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/worlds-richest-family-the-waltons-wealth-surpasses-the-gdp-of-greece-hungary-and-iran/articleshow/121595749.cms,"

Waltons’ humble origins of a retail empire

Global wealth that dwarfs nations

Beyond Retail: The Waltons' influence in sports

Luxurious life of Walton family members





The Walton family, heirs to the Walmart retail fortune, have once again cemented their position as the wealthiest family in the world, with a jaw-dropping collective net worth of $432 billion. This figure exceeds the entire gross domestic product (GDP) of nations such as Greece, Hungary, and Iran. It is a staggering comparison that highlights the sheer scale of the family's fortune. From humble beginnings in Arkansas, USA, the Waltons have built a retail empire that not only dominates the global market but also holds significant influence across industries including sports, real estate and entertainment.The story of the Walton family begins in 1962, when brothers Sam and Bud Walton opened the first Walmart store. Their vision was simple: offer low prices and great value. What followed was a retail revolution. Today, Walmart operates over 10,750 stores worldwide, including more than 4,600 in the United States alone, making it one of the most powerful corporations on the planet.Sam Walton, known for his discipline and work ethic, was often in the store by 4:30 a.m.and had a reputation for treating employees with respect. This ethos played a major role in Walmart's meteoric rise. Although Sam died in 1992 and Bud in 1995, their legacy lives on through their descendants, who continue to oversee and expand the business.The $432 billion fortune of the Walton family, as reported by Bloomberg, is greater than the GDPs of entire countries. For comparison, Greece’s GDP is around $300 billion, Hungary's is approximately $200 billion, and Iran’s is just above $400 billion. These figures put the Waltons’ personal wealth into dramatic perspective.Despite their riches, the family keeps a relatively low profile, though their financial moves speak volumes. Walmart continues to generate massive profits, and the family's shareholding in the company ensures that the fortune grows steadily year after year. Much of their wealth is held in trust funds and family foundations. Their philanthropic contributions remain modest compared to the size of their fortune.The family’s influence now extends far beyond the supermarket aisle. In 2022, they made headlines by purchasing the Denver Broncos NFL team for a record-breaking $4.7 billion. It remains one of the most expensive franchise deals in sports history. This acquisition was led by Greg Penner, Sam Walton’s son-in-law and current chairman of Walmart.Additionally, the Waltons have strong ties to sports mogul Stan Kroenke, who is married to Ann Walton, Bud Walton’s daughter. Kroenke’s portfolio includes Arsenal Football Club, the Los Angeles Rams, the Denver Nuggets, and the Colorado Avalanche. This gives the family indirect stakes in several top-tier sports franchises across the globe. These associations offer the Waltons influence in both American and European sports. Their reach extends from retail shelves to stadiums packed with millions of fans.Reflecting their immense fortune, family members own a number of ultra-luxurious assets. Notably, Nancy Walton Laurie owns Kaos, a $300 million superyacht said to be the largest yacht in the world owned by a woman. Previously owned by Qatari royalty, the vessel was extensively customised and is a floating symbol of the family’s vast wealth and exclusivity.As their empire continues to grow, the Waltons remain emblematic of the widening gap between ultra-wealthy dynasties and the rest of the world. They are a modern dynasty whose wealth has outstripped entire nations.","The Walton family, heirs to the Walmart retail fortune, have a collective net worth of $432 billion.

US heat alert! Why summer 2025 could be the most dangerous in decades according to NOAA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-heat-alert-why-summer-2025-could-be-the-most-dangerous-in-decades-according-to-noaa/articleshow/121579586.cms,"US Heat Alert

US to experience coast-to-coast heatwaves, NOAA warns



The West and Southwest, including Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada

The Gulf Coast and Florida, where high humidity will exacerbate heat index values

The Northeast and New England, regions historically less prepared for extreme heat events

Which US cities will face the worst heat in 2025



1. Northeast and New England

Cities like Boston, Hartford, and New York City could experience more frequent 90°F+ days than usual. These areas lack widespread air conditioning compared to hotter climates, making heat preparedness critical.

2. The Southwest and Four Corners

This region, already accustomed to hot summers, is expected to see record-breaking high temperatures. Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque could face days topping 115°F.

3. The Pacific Northwest

Typically known for mild summers, Seattle and Portland are under threat of multiple heat domes, similar to the deadly 2021 event. Infrastructure in these areas is still adapting to extreme heat.

4. Florida and Gulf Coast

High heat combined with tropical moisture could lead to oppressive heat indices over 110°F, creating a “wet sauna” environment. The risk of heat stroke and heat exhaustion is high.

Why cities feel like ovens: The urban heat island effect

Philadelphia is expected to exceed 40 days over 90°F, up from a historical average of 34

Chicago may experience back-to-back days above 95°F

Houston and Dallas could face “dangerously hot” periods with overnight temperatures staying above 80°F

Why heat causes more deaths than storms



Seniors over age 65

Young children

People with cardiovascular or respiratory conditions

Outdoor workers, especially in agriculture and construction

Wildfire threats: Fueling the fire season

High-risk zones in June:

Coastal Southeast

Central Texas

Four Corners region

Northern and Southern California

Later in the summer, wildfire threats could expand to:

Hawaii

The Great Basin

Southern Plains

Power grid and infrastructure challenges



Adaptation and safety measures



Personal safety tips

Stay hydrated with water, not sugary or alcoholic drinks

Avoid strenuous outdoor activity between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Wear light, breathable clothing

Use fans and air conditioning, or seek cooling centers

Community-level adaptations

Expanding green spaces and tree cover

Installing reflective rooftops and pavements

Establishing early warning systems for heat alerts

Subsidizing access to air conditioning for low-income households

Climate change and the bigger picture

The last 10 summers have all ranked in the top 15 warmest on record

Sea surface temperatures in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico are near historic highs, fueling atmospheric changes

Heatwaves are lasting longer, starting earlier, and occurring more frequently





As meteorological summer officially begins on June 1, 2025, the United States is preparing for what may become one of its hottest summers in recorded history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued an alarming seasonal outlook through its Climate Prediction Center (CPC), forecasting significantly above-average temperatures across nearly the entire country, as per The Economic Times report. Unlike past years that showed regional variability, the 2025 summer projection offers little reprieve anywhere in the US or even in most of Alaska. Driven by persistent atmospheric patterns, elevated sea surface temperatures, and the residual effects of climate change, this summer is shaping up to test the nation’s resilience to heat, wildfires, and health crises like never before.From densely packed urban neighborhoods to arid rural lands, the effects of this prolonged heat event are expected to ripple across infrastructure, agriculture, public health, and emergency services. Here's an in-depth look at what to expect, where the worst heat will strike, and how cities and individuals can prepare.According to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, model simulations show overwhelming support for a hotter-than-average summer across the continental US and much of Alaska. Areas most at risk of experiencing prolonged heat waves include:Johnna Infanti, a meteorologist with NOAA’s CPC, stated that “model guidance was overwhelmingly above normal across the US,” suggesting this forecast is one of the most confident summer projections ever released.Urban areas are uniquely vulnerable due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect—caused by concrete, asphalt, and limited green space retaining heat. According to NOAA:Lack of tree canopy, dark rooftops, and minimal airflow intensify the heat, disproportionately affecting low-income and elderly populations.Heat remains the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and floods. Vulnerable populations include:Heat stroke, dehydration, and heat exhaustion are all life-threatening conditions that can escalate quickly. Emergency departments are urged to prepare for spikes in admissions during heat waves.NOAA also projects below-normal precipitation for the Northern Rockies, Northwest, and central parts of the Great Plains. As vegetation dries out under extreme heat, wildfire risk surges.Wildfire smoke also presents a public health threat, worsening air quality for millions.Extreme heat drives up energy demand as households rely on air conditioning. States like Texas, California, and Arizona are particularly vulnerable to blackouts or rolling brownouts due to increased electricity usage.Water utilities, transportation infrastructure (such as buckling roads and warped train tracks), and emergency services may also struggle under the stress of high temperatures.Cities like Phoenix and Los Angeles have already implemented “heat officers”—government positions dedicated to heat mitigation planning. More cities are likely to follow.While seasonal weather variations play a role, the long-term warming trend driven by climate change continues to amplify the severity of summer heat. According to NOAA’s 2025 State of the Climate Report:Scientists agree that extreme summer heat is no longer an anomaly—but a new normal.","US to experience coast-to-coast heatwaves, NOAA warns.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

India to begin next Census in April 2026: Caste data to be included after 93 years; March 2027 reference date,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-from-april-2026-caste-enumeration-to-be-part-of-exercise-early-start-in-jk-uttarakhand/articleshow/121623209.cms,"The next nationwide census will begin on March 1, 2027, with Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and Uttarakhand starting earlier in October 2026. For the first time in over seven decades, the census will include caste enumeration to ensure transparency and national consistency.

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday announced that the next nationwide population census to start from April 1, 2026 and will, for the first time in over seven decades, include caste enumeration. The Census will be conducted in two phases under the Census Act, 1948, and the Census Rules, 1990. Reference date will be March 1, 2027.In snow-bound and non-synchronous regions including Ladakh, parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, the census will begin earlier, from October 2026. The reference date for these areas will be 00:00 hours on October 1, 2026, while for the rest of the country it will be 00:00 hours on March 1, 2027. A formal notification outlining these reference dates is expected to be published in the official gazette on June 16, 2025. Reference date is the date to which population count relates.Also read: What is caste census, and why does it matter - explained The decision to include caste data was confirmed earlier by Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw following a Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs meeting held on April 30. Vaishnaw said the move was aimed at ensuring transparency and consistency, and to address concerns over varying approaches adopted by states.“Some states have conducted caste surveys transparently, but others have not. These inconsistencies have created doubts and could disturb social harmony,” he said.The announcement comes as India prepares to undertake its first population census since 2011. The last census was conducted in two phases—House Listing and Housing Census from April to September 2010, and Population Enumeration in February 2011. Census 2021 had also been planned in a similar manner, but was indefinitely postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Preparations for the 2021 census had been completed and fieldwork was set to begin on April 1, 2020, when the pandemic hit.The inclusion of caste data in the upcoming census is considered a landmark development, especially since the last comprehensive caste-based count was done by the British between 1881 and 1931. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) conducted in 2011 under the UPA government did collect caste data, but it was never fully published or utilised. Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India, had earlier said that a caste census is essential to uncover deep-seated structural inequalities and to formulate inclusive policies.","The next nationwide census will begin on March 1, 2027, with Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and Uttarakhand starting earlier in October 2026.

Top stock market recommendations:For the past 14 trading days, Nifty has been static within a 2% band, however the highs of 25000 has been constantly providing supply non index longs. With the index now closing at a 3 week low on Tuesday, it continues to approach its downside target of 24300 / 24100 unless a closing above 25050 is not confirmed.On daily charts, the index has also formed a bearish head and shoulder pattern pointing out to similar targets wherein no support before it hits its 200 DMA can be seen. Nifty has had a nearly 15% run up in the past 6 weeks without a 2% correction. With the price action seen from the start of this week, it is fair for the index to retest 200 DMA support on downside which currently reads below 24100.Bank Nifty has faced rejection from its previous all-time highs above 56k mark in Tuesday’s trading session. Any trade below 55600 is likely to allow further skidding on the index for lower levels seen near 54700 / 54500 as the supply pressure is likely to mount post rejection seen earlier this week.Zydus Lifesciences stock has closed at a 2 month high, after breaking out from a falling trendline earlier this month which was in place since August 2024. Repeated higher lows have been seen from the start of this month on daily charts, this 2 high note closing on charts is likely to allow further thrust on the stock for a resistance meet at its 200 DMA near 980 odd.Ending its 11-month corrective phase, Great Eastern Shipping Company has given a breakout of a falling trendline which had been in place from the start of this correction. Overall this correction allowed the stock to give away nearly 50% of its rally which unfolded between lows of 2020 and highs of 2024. Further momentum is likely to unfold given the excesses being eliminated and higher lows seen on the daily charts.Tata Motors stock has seen a 5-7% corrective consolidation in the past 2 weeks of trade which was an after effect of a sharp 40% rally before that. With supportive news flow for domestic players in the new EV policy acting as tailwind, passenger vehicle stocks are likely to see further momentum. Tata Motors is a cleaner set up amongst the peers on charts for another 8-10% rally from CMP.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Zydus Lifesciences, Great Eastern Shipping Company, and Tata Motors are the top buy calls for today.

7. Oil and Gas producers:

US President Donald Trump has doubled down tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, following his earlier implementation of 25% tariffs less than three months ago.The move is intended to boost the US steel industry, but many businesses warn it will lead to higher prices for consumers.According to the New York Times, key sectors like housing, automotive, oil, and canned goods are expected to be hit hardest by Trump's increased tariffs. Homebuilders, car makers, oil producers, and packaging companies are expected to face rising costs, which many may pass on to consumers.Domestic steel industry representatives have welcomed the higher tariffs, saying they could boost investment and create more jobs in the US.Kevin Dempsey, president and chief executive at the American Iron and Steel Institute, stated that the increased tariffs would enhance US steel producers' competitiveness against China and other nations flooding the global market.He noted that many in the industry felt the earlier 25% tariff on steel imports wasn’t enough to offer adequate protection.""The increase to 50% is well justified and will help prevent a new surge in imports of steel,"" Dempsey said.He further continued that higher tariffs would eventually help create new jobs. ""Over time, increased production will lead to increased employment,"" Dempsey added.British steel and aluminum exporters will continue facing a 25% tariff when selling to the US, thanks to a temporary deal with the Trump administration.However, other countries like Canada are expected to face steeper challenges under the new tariff rules. As the primary foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, Canada's response has been strong.The Canadian Steel Producers Association criticised the increase, stating it ""essentially closes the US market to our domestic industry.""The European Steel Association has expressed concerns that this increase might redirect cheap foreign steel towards European markets.Aluminum industry groups back the US government's move to boost the domestic sector, but they stress the need for continued aluminum imports from Canada. These imports are essential for making specialised products that support American jobs and investments.""We urge the administration to take a tailored approach that reserves high tariffs for bad actors -- such as China that floods the market and includes carve outs for proven partners -- such as Canada,"" according to Matt Meenan, a spokesperson for the Aluminum Association.They also cautioned that higher tariffs alone won't boost domestic production unless trade policies become ""consistent, predictable trade and tariff policy to plan for current and future investment.""Increased steel tariffs are expected to drive up the cost of cars and trucks. This spells trouble for both consumers, who are already dealing with high vehicle prices, and carmakers, who are already burdened by rising costs due to earlier tariffs on imported parts and engines.""These tariff increases will further raise the cost of both imported and domestic steel and aluminum, thereby increasing the cost of assembling a car in the United States,"" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies on behalf of General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis.""This action places US industry and US workers at a disadvantage in the global marketplace,"" he added. The precise impact of increased metal tariffs on vehicle prices remains uncertain. Analysts suggest price increases could range from several hundred dollars to over $1,000 per vehicle. The timing of these price effects is also uncertain.The steel and aluminium tariffs are expected to increase construction costs and potentially limit new housing developments.Buddy Hughes, chair of the National Association of Home Builders, indicated that prior to the latest increase, builders had calculated tariffs would add $10,900 to new home costs."" President Trump's move to double steel and aluminum tariffs will have a negative impact on housing affordability by further disrupting building material supply chains and fueling business uncertainty,"" Hughes said in a statement.The increased metal tariffs will likely result in higher prices for canned goods at supermarkets.The Can Manufacturers Institute reports that domestic tin mill steel production has decreased by 75% over eight years due to significant production cuts.This reduction has led domestic can manufacturers and food producers to import approximately 80% of tin mill steel from international allies.The steel tariff increase will affect US oil companies' operations, as steel is essential for pipeline construction and resource extraction. Steel comprises 10% to 20% of new well costs.Rising metal costs coinciding with falling oil prices create difficulties for producers. Smaller operations, which typically cannot order materials far in advance, are particularly affected.","US President Donald Trump has doubled down tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%. The move is intended to boost the US steel industry, but many businesses warn it will lead to higher prices for consumers. Key sectors like housing, automotive, oil, and canned goods are expected to be hit hardest by the increased tariffs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121637497,imgsize-164288,width-400,resizemode-4/121637497.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Poll Do you think the amendments will affect national identity in Bangladesh? Yes, it will change how we see our history. No, history will remain unchanged.





Bangladesh's interim government on Wednesday clarified it has not revoked the freedom fighter status of ""Bangabandhu"" Sheikh Mujibur Rahman despite amending the Jatiya Muktijoddha Council (Jamuka) Act.""Sheikh Mujib's freedom fighter status has not been revoked,"" Azad Majumder, deputy press secretary to chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, leader of the caretaker government, told news agency ANI.Faruk-e-Azam, adviser to the ministry of law and affairs, also said those in the erstwhile Mujib-led provisional government will continue to be identified as freedom fighters.By making the amendments, the Yunus administration gave a new definition of who would be recognised as a participant in the country's struggle for independence from Pakistan.Under the amended ordinance, members of the provisional ""Mujibnagar government"" would now be recognized as ""associates of the Liberation War.""The ordinance also identified four other categories of freedom fighters as ""associates.""These four categories are: Bangladeshi professionals who have made special contributions to the liberation war abroad and played an active role in shaping world public opinion; officials, employees, envoys and others assistants of the Mujibnagar government; artists and technicians of the ""Swadhin Bangla Radio Station"" and all the journalists who served in support of the Liberation War at home and abroad; and the Swadhin Bangla Football Team.This comes just days after Sheikh Mujib's photos were removed from Bangladesh's bank notes.

Outbreaks in affected counties





Immunisation coverage for measles among children has declined, after the Covid pandemic in nearly 80 per cent of over 2,000 US counties analysed in a new study. The drop includes several regions currently experiencing outbreaks.The study, conducted by Johns Hopkins University and recently published in JAMA, was cited by the Associated Press. It highlights increased vulnerability in many areas, in line with state and national data showing declining routine childhood vaccination rates.""When you look at the state level or national level ... you really don't see those drastic drops. Those are there. They're real and they're really problematic,"" said Lauren Gardner, the study's senior author and infectious disease modelling specialist at Johns Hopkins University, who also developed the university’s Covid-19 database.As of Friday, the US has recorded 1,088 measles cases in 2025, the highest year-to-date total in more than three decades. The vast majority of cases have affected unvaccinated individuals and have been traced to both international and domestic travel. Three deaths have occurred during the current outbreaks.Although measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000 due to the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, declining vaccination rates now threaten that status.All 50 states require two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine for public school attendance, yet non-medical exemptions reached record highs in the 2023–2024 school year. Experts emphasise that a 95 per cent vaccination rate is necessary to prevent outbreaks.The Johns Hopkins researchers analysed 2,066 counties in 33 states, comparing average kindergarten vaccination coverage from pre-pandemic years (2017–2020) with post-pandemic rates (2022–2024). When kindergarten-specific data was unavailable, alternative metrics were used to approximate coverage.Since late January, Texas has reported 742 measles cases, most concentrated in West Texas. Gaines County leads with 411 cases, nearly two per cent of its population. Though vaccination coverage rose two percentage points post-pandemic, it remains at just 82.4 per cent, well below herd immunity levels. Terry and Yoakum counties, with 60 and 20 cases respectively, also fall short of the 95 per cent threshold, at 93.7 per cent and 91.8 per cent. Lubbock County, near Gaines, reported 53 cases, with coverage slipping from just under 95 per cent to 91.8 per cent. El Paso County, despite maintaining above-threshold coverage at 96.5 per cent, saw a 2.1-point decline alongside 57 reported cases.Kansas has also seen outbreaks. Gray County reported 25 cases, with vaccination coverage plunging from 94 per cent to 71 per cent. Haskell County saw an 18-point drop to 65 per cent with 11 cases, while Stevens County, with seven cases, dipped to 90.5 per cent.In Colorado, seven cases were traced to a mid-May arrival at Denver International Airport, affecting six residents and one visitor. Arapahoe County logged two cases with coverage at 88.4 per cent. El Paso County reported three cases and a drop to 80 per cent.North Dakota researchers analysed only post-pandemic years due to limited earlier data. Williams County recorded 16 cases with fluctuating coverage: 84.6 per cent in 2022, 87.7 in 2023, then falling to 83.5 per cent in 2024. Cass County, with seven cases, held steady at around 92.7 per cent. Grand Forks County reported 10 cases, with coverage dropping from 95.4 to 93.4 per cent.","US has recorded 1,088 measles cases in 2025, the highest year-to-date total in more than three decades.

A South Florida weather expert told his audience alleging the negative the impact of National Weather Service (NWS) personnel shortages on forecast accuracy.During a broadcast, earlier this week, on NBC affiliate WTVJ, meteorologist John Morales reflected on his 2019 hurricane coverage, stating, ""confidently, I went on TV, and I told you, 'It's going to turn. You don't need to worry; it is going to turn.'""Then he expressed concerns about current capabilities, saying, ""And I am here to tell you, that I am not sure I can do that this year, because of the cuts, the gutting, the sledgehammer attack on science in general.""Morales highlighted specific staffing issues, saying, ""And this is a multi generational impact on science in this country. All right, but specifically, let's talk about the federal government cuts to the National Weather Service and to NOAA. Did you know that Central and South Florida National Weather Service offices are currently basically 20 to 40% understaffed from Tampa to Key west, including the Miami office, 20 to 40% understaffed. Now, this type of staffing shortage is having impacts across the nation because there's been a nearly 20% reduction in weather balloon releases, launches that carry those radiosondes. And what we're starting to see is that the quality of the forecasts is becoming degraded.""Earlier this year, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Elon Musk's leadership (who has now stepped down from the role), implemented severe reductions at NWS and NOAA, organisations responsible for delivering daily weather forecasts, immediate storm alerts, climate surveillance and tracking extreme weather conditions.In February, the agency dismissed hundreds of weather forecasters and placed other federal NOAA staff on probation, followed by additional staff reductions exceeding 1,000 positions. By April, approximately 20 percent of positions remained unfilled across nearly half of the NWS forecast facilities.However, The Hill's Monday report indicated NWS's intention to recruit 126 new staff following substantial workforce reductions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NWS's parent organisation, had previously reduced staff numbers as part of government downsizing efforts.Florida and other southeastern US states face regular Atlantic hurricane threats, with the season commencing Sunday.NOAA responded on Tuesday via email to The Hill, stating, ""NOAA leadership is taking steps to address those who took a voluntary early retirement option. NWS continues to conduct short-term Temporary Duty assignments (TDYs), and is in the process of conducting a series of Reassignment Opportunity Notices (RONs) to fill roles at NWS field locations with the greatest operational need.""","South Florida meteorologist warns he might not be able to predict hurricanes accurately in future. John Morales: ""I am not sure I can do that this year, because of the cuts, the gutting, the sledgehammer attack on science in general"" Florida and other southeastern US states face regular Atlantic hurricane threats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121632636,imgsize-693272,width-400,resizemode-4/121632636.jpg"
Jeffrey Epstein’s hidden wealth revealed: Investment in Peter Thiel’s firm now nets millions for his estate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jeffrey-epsteins-hidden-wealth-revealed-investment-in-peter-thiels-firm-now-nets-millions-for-his-estate/articleshow/121628963.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein (File photo)





Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died by suicide nearly six years ago, invested $40 million in two funds managed by Valar Ventures, a New York-based firm co-founded by Silicon Valley mogul Peter Thiel, according to a confidential estate financial report obtained by The New York Times. These investments, made during 2015 and 2016, have now grown to an estimated $170 million, making them the largest remaining asset in Epstein’s estate.The financial link between Epstein and Thiel’s firm had remained undisclosed until now. Valar Ventures focuses on tech-based financial services startups, and the firm’s representative described Epstein in 2014 as a “well-known adviser to world leaders, top universities and philanthropic organizations.”The estate, which currently holds over $200 million in assets, has distributed hundreds of millions in settlements to Epstein’s victims and the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein maintained a residence. Yet the substantial returns on the Valar investment are unlikely to benefit the roughly 200 victims who previously accepted monetary settlements, signing releases preventing further claims against the estate or associated individuals.Instead, the funds are expected to go to one of Epstein’s former romantic partners and two longtime advisers who are designated beneficiaries of his estate. A confidential document about the estate’s 1953 Trust, the main vehicle for asset distribution, shows Epstein intended to forgive about $19 million in loans, including some to entities “closely associated” with the estate co-executors and advisers Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn. David Boies , a lawyer for several victims, criticized federal authorities for their lack of pursuit of civil forfeiture actions after Epstein’s death. “While we are grateful for the government’s prosecution of Epstein and Maxwell, the truth is that, both before and afterwards, the government was largely asleep at the switch,” Boies said. Civil forfeiture could have allowed the government to seize remaining estate assets potentially usable for victim compensation. However, a person familiar with the case, quoted by NYT, said federal prosecutors considered this but rejected it to avoid delaying settlement payments.Epstein amassed his wealth by charging high fees for tax and estate services to select billionaires, including retail magnate Leslie Wexner and private equity investor Leon Black. Black reportedly paid Epstein over $158 million in fees, and Epstein’s Manhattan mansion was once owned by Wexner.Aaron Curtis, speaking for Valar, said the firm “hopes that the eventual distribution of these investments can be put to positive use by helping victims move forward with their lives.” However, the Valar investments remain illiquid due to typical venture capital lock-up periods, which means cash disbursements to victims or other parties are delayed.At his death, Epstein’s assets- including investments, properties, artwork, and jewelry- were valued at around $600 million. The estate’s most recent public filing, as of March 31, lists assets exceeding $131 million, including roughly $50 million in cash, though investment values have not been updated since Epstein’s death.Meanwhile, a federal civil lawsuit filed by Boies’ firm seeks to represent unsettled victims in a potential class action against the estate executors. Previous settlements ranged from $500,000 to $2 million per victim. Once this lawsuit is resolved, remaining estate funds will be distributed according to Epstein’s will, which directs assets to the 1953 Trust.","Jeffrey Epstein invested $40 million in two funds managed by Valar Ventures, a New York-based firm co-founded by Silicon Valley mogul Peter Thiel.
