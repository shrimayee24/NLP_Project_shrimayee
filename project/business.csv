NSA starts probe into GPS spoofing at IGI airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nsa-starts-probe-into-gps-spoofing-at-igi-airport/articleshow/125237557.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The office of National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval has launched a probe into the unprecedented GPS spoofing IGI Airport has been facing for the past few weeks. NSA is learnt to be coordinating with multiple aviation and defence agencies on this issue as spoofing has been usually common in conflict zones.Due to this phenomenon, planes coming to land often get wrong location or heading signals and false terrain warnings about 60 nautical miles from the airport.This is the first time that the Delhi airport has been facing this issue. The 'automatic terminal information service' for IGIA has been regularly issuing alerts about spoofing and the airlines have been accordingly informing their pilots.While security agencies are tackling the source of this interference, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai on Monday cleared the promulgation of category-1 (CAT-I) instrument landing system (ILS) at IGIA's warhorse runway 10/28's 10 on the Dwarka side. Now, Airports Authority of India is likely to issue a notice to airmen by Tuesday.DGCA expedited this process from the original date of Nov 27 due to the spoofing. This will help an aircraft land from the Dwarka side on the main runway (10/28) when easterlies are blowing even if GPS spoofing is taking place.Without ILS, aircraft can land using 'required navigation performance', but it requires GPS and spoofing had affected flight movement on the main runway a few times in the recent past.The inability to land on runway 10 end had led to congestion at India's busiest airport, which now handles about 1,550 daily flights and some flights had to divert to alternate airports like Jaipur.Delhi International Airport Ltd has warned that ""some flight schedules may be impacted"" on Tuesday as ""mandatory flight calibration of ILS will take place between 11.30am and 1.30pm as part of continuous safety practices"". Flights will be ""regulated during this period"". Accordingly, DIAL has advised passengers to ""coordinate with airlines to get updated flight information status"".All the runways at IGIA are scheduled for calibration every six months. On Tuesday, sources say, the ILS of runway 29 left (29L), which is closest to the Gurgaon side and used for arrivals, is due for calibration.",NSA Ajit Doval has launched a probe into the unprecedented GPS spoofing IGI Airport has been facing for the past few weeks.

Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.





BENGALURU: Former grocery store chain owner Ravi Prasad Reddy of Hebbagodi, arrested on charges of murdering two friends, had become a vegetable vendor after incurring a loss of around Rs 5 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic.Around 60 people to whom he lent money or with whom he had invested in chit funds, died or left the city during the pandemic, causing him a huge loss, police investigations have revealed.Reddy, 40, allegedly murdered tea shop owner R Madesh (41), who was also involved in the chit-fund business, and Balappa Reddy (61), who owned a metal fabrication factory — to rob them and demand ransom. Reddy was arrested from a bar close to his home Saturday afternoon.The accused was shot at and injured in both knees when he tried to attack police personnel near a burial ground at Bommasandra, where he was taken for a spot investigation late Saturday night.Police picked up Reddy's two associates — Dhanush and Sateesh — for questioning as they accompanied him during Balappa's abduction on Nov 6. Reddy's elder sister, Sunanda, is also on the radar as she was allegedly in the same vehicle during the abduction.Police are yet to question her.""We intensified our investigation and questioned the bereaved family members about those with whom the two victims had financial dealings. This is how we zeroed in on the suspect. Special teams of CCB and Hebbagodi police were formed to nab the suspect,"" city police commissioner Seemanth Kumar Singh told TOI.The two murdered men were Reddy's close friends and he claimed to have lent them money earlier.""But they refused to lend me money when I was in deep trouble. This made me develop hatred towards them,"" police quoted Reddy as saying. Cops are also investigating whether Reddy owed them any money.Reddy, from Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, set up his chain of Happy Family Stores with help from his uncle. He earned good profits, lent money to others, and invested almost Rs 5 crore in chit funds, an investigating officer said.When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, defaults by his debtors forced him to sell his house and a plot of land near Hebbagodi for Rs 2 crore. He also leased out his stores to his relatives. Despite these efforts, more financial losses compelled his wife and two children to live with his uncle, while Reddy moved to a small house rented from Balappa, one of the victims.To rebuild his life, Reddy set up a vegetable stall and brought Dhanush and Sateesh from Andhra Pradesh to help him with the business.Inspiration drawn from crime filmsAccording to Reddy, movies showing people kidnapping victims for ransom encouraged him to do so. He planned to kidnap the two men and release them after receiving ransom. He purchased an air pistol, a metal detector, and knives. Reddy told cops that he wanted to use the metal detector to find hidden treasures.""Investigations revealed that Reddy hatched his conspiracy for around three months. First, he targeted Madesh on Nov 4,"" deputy commissioner of police (Electronics City division) M Narayana told TOI.Reddy was aware that Madesh, who was constructing a house, had Rs 10 lakh in cash stashed there. ""Knowing he would be alone in the under-construction building, I entered the house and threatened Madesh at knifepoint, demanding the money. But he resisted and shouted for help before running away. I chased him and attacked him with a knife. Seeing some neighbours coming out, I sped away on my scooter,"" police quoted Reddy as saying.Reddy waited for two days and decided on his next move as nobody suspected him. This time, he drove an MUV of an advocate-friend to Balappa's factory. Saying he had a business deal to discuss, he made Balappa join him in the vehicle.""He drove the MUV in the direction of Hosur and stopped at a desolate place. Then, he demanded money from Balappa who refused. In a fit of anger, Reddy attacked Balappa with the same knife he used in killing Madesh. Then, he brought the body back to his Hebbagodi residence, shifted it to his goods autorickshaw, and returned the MUV after removing stains. Then, Balappa's body was taken to the forest area near Hosur highway and dumped on the same night,"" an investigating officer said.","Ravi Prasad Reddy, 40, allegedly murdered tea shop owner R Madesh (41) and Balappa Reddy (61) to rob them and demand ransom.

'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

NEW DELHI: As a grey blanket of smog smothered the city and Delhiites struggled to breathe, air pollution data went missing for a major portion of Monday. Since 1 pm, neither hourly air quality index (AQI) updates nor the city's daily average had been released till late evening, even as the air visibly worsened since the afternoon.While hourly AQI data for individual stations was back on the Central Pollution Control Board website around 9pm, there were gaps in readings at several monitors. There was no response from CPCB or the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to TOI's queries on the data outage.As per an independent analysis, the average PM2.5 concentration from 12am to 9pm on Monday was 249 micrograms per cubic metre as compared to 215 micrograms per cubic metre over the same period of the previous day. Based on these readings, the PM2.5 levels were near severe on Monday.Till early afternoon, when the last available readings were published, the city's average PM2.5 levels - the primary pollutant responsible for Delhi's foul air - were nearly identical to those recorded at the same time on Sunday. Yet, the corresponding AQI values were significantly higher, mirroring the palpable deterioration that residents could feel.By evening, visibility had dropped sharply and an acrid stench hung in the air. Roads and flyovers disappeared into a yellow-grey haze as people covered their faces and hurried indoors.""The CPCB has not updated any data since the afternoon and it's not the first time this has happened in the last two years. The data missing from such a crucial website at such a critical time, handicaps citizens, researchers and regulators in taking action to reduce pollution or initiate precautionary measures,"" said Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts.From 1pm onwards, data went missing from the CPCB website but was available on the DPCC portal. This indicated that the monitors were working and the glitch was elsewhere.By around 5.30pm, out of 562 stations across India, only 4 were live.Gurgaon's AQI 'cover story': Trees, walls & missing dataA thick smokescreen hung over the city till late Monday morning. It was much the same in Delhi, Noida and other parts of NCR. But while Delhi's AQI was 345 (very poor) and Noida's 318 (very poor), Gurgaon seemed to be breathing easier with an AQI of 221 (poor). What one saw didn't fit with what the data suggested.It's been like this through this peak pollution season, since Diwali, with Gurgaon's average AQI mostly better than other NCR cities. Since Diwali, Gurgaon has recorded only two very poor AQI days, 16 poor days and three moderate days.Within the same airshed, this can happen sometimes because of wind direction and hyperlocal meteorological factors. But when it sustains over a period of time, one has to look more closely at the data. In fact, place recording the data. That's what we did on Monday. It was revealing.All five continuous air monitoring stations - at Vikas Sadan, Sector 51, Teri Gram, Gwalpahari and Manesar - are close to thick foliage or near walls, violating CPCB rules that require monitors to be installed at least 20-30 metres from trees and 50 metres from major structures, in open and well-ventilated areas. The stations have also not consistently recorded PM2.5 and sulphur dioxide (SO₂) data, lowering the city's AQI averages. Gwalpahari and Teri Gram recorded incomplete indices for several days. LED display boards at all five stations have, meanwhile, been non-functional for weeks.Over the years, vegetation within govt and institutional campuses has grown tall around these stations, trapping air and absorbing a share of pollutants before they reach the sensors. The ambience of the stations, in other words, is very different from the ambience of the road that hits you as you step out. ""Vegetation grew, but the monitors' locations stayed fixed,"" an official said.An analysis of CPCB's real-time data shows the Gwalpahari station failed to record PM2.5 levels for several hours on multiple days this month. Since AQI averages are based on available readings, missing data of PM2.5 - the pollutant most responsible for NCR's poor air - improves the average score. At Teri Gram, SO₂ data was missing for extended periods, which means one key gaseous pollutant wasn't factored in AQI calculations.""The stations are recording partial data and AQI looks better than it should. There are long gaps in data,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Centre for Science and Environment.""There is no live display, but the data is being generated every day. LED screens are unable to show data as they were shut down for several months,"" Krishan Kumar, regional officer, HSPCB, told TOI.","From 1pm onwards, data went missing from the CPCB website but was available on the DPCC portal. By around 5.30pm, out of 562 stations across India, only 4 were live.

300-Kg Explosives, Weapons, Timers: J&K Police Stop Deadly Terror Plot Targeting North India In Time

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor from Lucknow was arrested on Monday for her alleged involvement in a terror module operating across Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, officials told news agency PTI. An AK-47 rifle was recovered from her vehicle, they added.The accused, identified as Dr Shaheen, was arrested along with seven others, including Kashmiri doctor Muzammil Ganaie, who was picked up in Faridabad.Dr Shaheen was flown to Srinagar for custodial interrogation.According to officials, the arrests led to the seizure of 2,900 kg of explosives and uncovered what they described as a “white collar” network linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.The operation was carried out jointly by police forces of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, along with central agencies. Officials declined to specify the exact dates of the arrests, citing ongoing investigations.Police in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir have recovered a large quantity of explosives and weapons from a rented apartment in Faridabad, following the arrest of a Pulwama-based doctor suspected of links with the Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed group.Officials said around 360 kg of a highly inflammable substance, believed to be ammonium nitrate, was seized along with arms and bomb-making material.The haul included an assault rifle with three magazines, 83 live rounds, a pistol with eight live cartridges, two empty cartridges, two spare magazines, 12 suitcases, a bucket filled with the explosive substance, 20 timers, four batteries, remote controls, five kilograms of heavy metal and a walkie-talkie set.Police believe the materials were meant for large-scale terror attacks.The recovery followed the arrest of Dr Adil Ahmad Rather from Pulwama, who was detained in Saharanpur. His questioning led investigators to Dr Muzammal, an assistant professor at Al-Falah University in Faridabad, who was arrested nearly ten days ago. A search of his rented accommodation resulted in Sunday’s seizure, officials added.","Dr Shaheen arrested along with seven others, including Kashmiri doctor Muzammil Ganaie.

"Canal near Kartavya Path green with algae, pavements broken",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canal-near-kartavya-path-green-with-algae-pavements-broken/articleshow/125237476.cms,"/

NEW DELHI: Just a few metres away from the redeveloped Kartavya Path (earlier known as Rajpath) - a major component of the Central Vista project - sections of pavements lie broken, a canal that was refurbished has stagnant water, while several vehicles are stationed in a parking lot that has come up unauthorisedly.After the care bestowed upon the canal next to Kartavya Path police post, as part of the Kartavya Path project, which had made it look beautiful, it is now a portrait of bureaucratic apathy, with the water turning thick green with moss and algae due to lack of maintenance for weeks.These neglected patches are not tucked away in some forgotten corner. Every day, hundreds of govt employees, including senior officials from nearby buildings that house ministries, go past the stretch during their post-lunch walk. Yet, few appear to have raised the issue or alerted the agencies to set things right.TOI visited the sites near Kartavya Path on Thursday, only to find that pavement stretches along the Rafi Marg near Krishi Bhawan have remained damaged, posing risks to pedestrians and marring the aesthetics of one of Delhi's most prominent public spaces.The entire area falls under the jurisdiction of the housing and urban affairs ministry.When Kartavya Path was inaugurated, it had announced the installation of 60 aerators in canals to prevent stagnation and ensure clean oxygenated water. These systems were expected to keep the water clear and flowing, eliminating any chance of buildup of moss or algae.When contacted, ministry sources on Monday said 10 refurnished canals adjacent to Kartavya Path are being regularly cleaned by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). They added that CPWD had faced difficulty at only one canal as the cables connecting three aerators needed repairs. ""The aerator cables that are not functioning are likely to be repaired in the next two days. Meanwhile, the canal is being cleaned manually,"" one of them said.Another location between the canal (behind the police post) and Rail Bhawan has become a parking lot for dozens of vehicles. Sources said the area was used for some works during the construction of the new Parliament complex. But more than two years after the completion of the Parliament building, the area is yet to be restored.On the condition of footpaths on Rafi Marg along Krishi Bhawan and Vayu Bhawan, sources said these had to be dismantled to lay new underground electric cables for electric substations, to supply power to new Central Vista buildings. The work has been completed, and restoration of footpaths and the cleaning of debris will be done by Nov 13. The footpaths will be restored on a priority basis by Nov 25, they said.""This is another example of how maintenance gets less attention than new construction and development projects. For months now, the green areas and landscape near Krishi Bhawan have been neglected, and these are spruced up only ahead of Republic Day,"" said an official working at Krishi Bhawan.","A canal that was refurbished has stagnant water, while several vehicles are stationed in a parking lot that has come up unauthorisedly.

Data mismatch on dog bites raises question on health surveillance

NEW DELHI: Contrary to the Union government's claim in Parliament that no human rabies deaths occurred in Delhi between 2022 and 2024, information obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act reveals a starkly different reality.According to records shared by Maharshi Valmiki Infectious Diseases (MVID) Hospital - the Capital's only dedicated infectious disease facility under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) - 18 people succumbed to rabies in the city during this three-year period.The RTI data shows six deaths in 2022, 2 in 2023, and 10 in 2024 at MVID Hospital in Kingsway Camp. These figures directly contradict the written reply submitted by minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying S P Singh Baghel in the Lok Sabha earlier this year, which stated that ""zero human rabies deaths"" were recorded in Delhi from January 2022 to January 2025.The Lok Sabha reply, however, did include data on animal bite cases reported in Delhi during this period - 6,691 cases in 2022, 17,874 in 2023, and 25,210 in 2024 - indicating a steady year-on-year rise in dog bite incidents even as human deaths were officially shown as nil.The sharp mismatch between central and local data on rabies deaths in Delhi has raised questions over coordination between health surveillance systems and the accuracy of reporting mechanisms for rabies, a disease that remains 100% preventable yet almost always fatal once symptoms appear.In Parliament, the minister said that under the National Rabies Control Programme, states compile monthly data on dog bites and rabies deaths and upload it to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme portal. This system, he noted, enhanced surveillance of rabies cases and animal bites nationwide. While Baghel was unavailable for comments and did not respond to text messages, his additional PS, Himashu Sharma, said that offhand they cannot comment on the issue of discrepancy in the data, if any, without seeking a proper response from the department.Under the National Action Plan for Dog-Mediated Rabies Elimination by 2030 - jointly launched in September 2021 by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying - the National Centre for Disease Control implements the human health component, while the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying oversees the animal health aspect.The plan emphasises mass dog vaccination, sterilisation, and ensuring uninterrupted availability of anti-rabies vaccine and anti-rabies serum/rabies immunoglobulin at govt facilities. These are provided free of cost under the National Free Drug Initiative of the National Health Mission and are part of the essential drug lists of all states.","Data mismatch on dog bites raises question on health surveillance systems.

JLN rebuild could be inspired by Qatar's famed Sports City

NEW DELHI: Delhi's iconic sports venue, Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Stadium, which was originally built for the 1982 Asian Games and later refurbished at a cost of over Rs 900 crore ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, will likely be demolished and undergo a major makeover, according to sports ministry officials.The ministry is considering plans to redevelop the venue into a sprawling sports city in coming years, catering to all major disciplines, including a lodging facility for athletes, officials said on Monday.The Union govt plans to overhaul the 102-acre JLN stadium complex into a state-of-the-art, multi-discipline premier facility equipped with world-class infrastructure for both training purposes and hosting major sporting events.""The planning is in the proposal stage. Other ministries, including the urban development ministry, need to be consulted as well. The timeline for the project and the estimated cost has not yet been worked out. But it's been decided to dismantle and redevelop the JLN stadium into a premier sports city,"" officials said.Officials told TOI that the proposed sports city would be modelled on Qatar's Sports City, also known as Aspire Zone, in the Baaya district of Al Rayyan, which is located near Doha. It was built in 2003 at a cost running into billions of dollars. The facility was central to Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and forms a key part of its ambitions to host the Olympics in 2036. Last week, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya and his team attended the second World Summit for Social Development in Qatar.It has been learnt that the minister visited the Sports City and was left impressed with the facilities. Mandaviya even enquired at length about the project development from the Qatari sports officials.According to ministry sources, a delegation from Qatar would soon visit Delhi to assess the viability of the JLN redevelopment project and prepare a roadmap for Indian authorities. The ministry would also study two other key sports infrastructure for JLN stadium redevelopment - Australia's Docklands stadium in Melbourne that can host cricket, Australian Rules football, rugby, cricket and soccer, and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave closer home in Ahmedabad, which is spread across 650 acres and includes the Narendra Modi stadium and multiple Olympic-standard facilities. The project cost the Gujarat govt Rs 5,050 cr.""All offices inside the stadium, including some of the ministry's departments like Sports Authority of India (SAI), National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada), National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL), and Income Tax department will be relocated as and when the project takes off. Currently, over 100 acres of land that it occupies is not being used to its optimal level. Only 28 percent has been utilised,"" officials said.JLN stadium, with a seating capacity of 60,000, hosted several prestigious international events, including the Delhi CWG 2010 and U17 FIFA World Cup in 2017. It recently received a major renovation for the World Para Athletics Championships, which saw the participation of over 2,200 athletes globally from 104 nations.A new blue-coloured, nine-lane Mondo synthetic track was installed at both the main ground and warm-up area for an approximate cost of Rs 25 cr, while the total stadium refurbishment cost was around Rs 80 crore.The facility is primarily used for athletics events and football matches and has an archery, badminton and table tennis academy."," Delhi's iconic sports venue, Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Stadium, will likely be demolished and undergo a major makeover.

Supreme Court to seek government clarity on census, delimitation process

NEW DELHI: Observing that 33% reservation for women in legislative bodies is meant to bring social, economic and political justice for ""the largest minority of the country"" that is women, Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a plea seeking immediate implementation of quota for women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, instead of waiting for delimitation after the next census as required by the 106th Constitutional Amendment Act.Though a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan expressed its reluctance to entertain the petition, it finally agreed to examine it after senior advocate Shobha Gupta pleaded that the court should ask the Centre to brief when it intended to conduct census and thereafter delimitation exercise.Gupta submitted that the constitutional amendment cannot be put on hold for an indefinite period.""The constitutional amendment cannot be put on hold for an uncertain period. In fact, a special session of Parliament was called for implementing the reservation in Parliament as well as in the state legislatures, and both houses passed this bill unanimously and honourable President of India also gave assent and thereafter Act was notified on Sept 28, 2023. But it is not being implemented.

Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan expressed its reluctance to entertain the petition.

‘Never Heard Such an Explosion’: Locals Recall Shock and Panic After Delhi Blast

NEW DELHI: A deafening noise, car parts tossed into the air, and several bodies strewn across - eyewitnesses who found themselves near the spot of Monday evening's blast outside Red Fort metro station recalled scenes of complete chaos, destruction and trauma.The force of the explosion was immense, felt far and wide. The window at Gate No. 1 metro station - on the opposite side of the road - was completely shattered. Within seconds, debris was scattered everywhere, and fear and panic set in.""I heard the voice 300 metres away, behind Lala Lajpat Rai Market. We came out and saw people running,"" said Vinod Kumar (40), a coolie in Bhagirath Palace. ""I have never heard such a loud blast ever in my life. I fell three times due to the explosion. It felt as if we were all going to die...,"" recalled a local shopkeeper.At the site, slippers and shoes were seen lying in several places, left by the hundreds who ran for their lives - rushing off in different directions and into the closest lane they could find. Some vehicles passing by near Gate No. 4 metro station were left abandoned mid-road by drivers who feared another explosion.Jamna, a 50-year-old woman, stood crying near the barricade, frantically looking for her son Arjun. Disoriented and trembling, she said, ""He sells flowers in a nearby market... I can't find him now...""Police cordoned off the area and set up barricades. Shopkeepers, who had moments earlier been going about their day, were seen searching for their vehicles or trying to reach their loved ones to make sure they were safe.Akshay (41), a business man whose electronics shop was just 200 metres away, said, ""No one could figure out what happened. Several cars were damaged. It felt like the ground was shaking. People said it was a CNG blast, but it felt like something else...""Amid the chaos, there were also good Samaritans like Chander Prakash and his friend Abhijeet Singh, who sprang into action to help the injured. ""We were near the temple when we heard two loud blasts,"" Prakash recalled, his voice shaking. ""Suddenly, there was mayhem - people screaming, fireballs everywhere and debris flying in all directions. We rushed to assist the injured, lifting them and helping carry them into ambulances. ""Jai (49), a watch shop owner travelling from Lala Lajpat Rai Market towards Kashmere Gate, had a close shave as he was just 10 metres from the spot. ""I parked my scooty some distance away due to the rush and took an e-rickshaw with two others. Within a minute, I heard a noise so loud my ears got blocked. Then I saw car parts flying and scattered body parts,"" Jai said.Maujib (24), who was at a nearby traffic signal, recalled the panic: ""There was a huge crowd, and the moment we heard a loud noise, everyone just scrambled and ran for their lives.""Hours later, the usually crowded area with barely any space to walk stood eerily empty under the flashing lights of police and emergency teams.(With inputs from Kushagra Singh)","Witnesses who found themselves near the spot of Monday evening's blast outside Red Fort metro station recalled scenes of complete chaos, destruction and trauma.

Massive Car Explosion Near Delhi’s Red Fort Hours After Faridabad Terror Plot bust, Many Dead

4 toll plazas in NCR among 10 in country that see most FASTag use

NEW DELHI: At least nine people were killed and 30 others injured following a high-intensity explosion in a car near Red Fort in Old Delhi on Monday evening. The powerful blast also set at least three other vehicles moving alongside ablaze. The impact of the blast was such that human body parts along with parts of vehicles were found flung across a 20-25-metre radius.Massive flames and thick smoke engulfed the area before police and fire teams contained the situation. Apart from the occupants of the car, a Gurgaon number plate i20 hatchback, passersby were also killed in the explosion.A forensic report is awaited on the nature of the blast and the ensuing fire to confirm a terror angle, cops said. If it is indeed terror-related, this would be the first such blast in Delhi in 14 years, the last being in 2011 at the high court.Police commissioner Satish Golcha said it was around 6.52pm that a slow-moving vehicle stopped at the traffic signal. ""An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to it, nearby vehicles were also damaged. Some people died, and some were injured in the incident,"" he said.Late evening, police said the vehicle was registered in the name of a Gurgaon resident, Salman, but it was sold to someone.Cops said the ID of the current owner had the name Tariq, from Pulwama.Home minister Amit Shah also spoke with the Intelligence Bureau chief. The situation is being closely monitored. ""The home minister has also called us, and information is being shared with him from time to time,"" Golcha added.Fire officials said they received an SOS call around 6.55pm about ""some type of blast in a car and vehicle fire"". Seven fire tenders were sent to the spot. Soon, police and special cell also rushed. However, as the casualties and the scale of the blast was confirmed, NSG, NIA and other agencies were also pressed into service.Four toll plazas in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) - Kherki Daula on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Mundka on UER-II, Chhajarsi in Ghaziabad and Bagan in Sonipat - are among the top 10 locations on the National Highways network in the country with the highest use of the FASTag annual pass by private vehicle owners.Sources said that at some plazas, such as Kherki Daula, the share of transactions happening through the annual pass exceeds 50%. This reflects how the FASTag annual pass has become one of the most popular and preferred modes of toll payment, an official said.So far, over 32 lakh private vehicle owners have opted for the annual pass, which is both convenient and economical.Officials said that a similar trend is expected among vehicle owners using the Dwarka Expressway, as many officegoers commuting to Gurugram and Manesar are likely to prefer the tolling mode to cut expenses and save time. For such users, the total toll for a one-way trip through Bijwasan and Kherki Daula will be barely Rs 30.The annual pass, which costs Rs 3,000, allows commuters to cross 200 plazas and can be renewed multiple times a year. ""Since the renewal process through NHAI's Rajyamarg App is seamless, it has become very convenient for vehicle users,"" an official said, adding that the FASTag annual pass has also boosted the popularity of the app - a single-window platform offering information and services related to NHAI-managed highways.He added that greater use of the App by commuters will help NHAI get more insights into commuting patterns and high load stretches for future planning and expansion.",Four toll plazas in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) among 10 in country that see most FASTag use.

EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?

NEW DELHI: The 30th session of the annual UN climate conference (COP30) kicked off on Monday in Belem, Brazil, with a focus on climate finance to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries by 2035. Discussions on the inaugural day, however, were centred around setting key agenda points, involving five critical issues, for negotiations.The presidencies of this year’s host Brazil and last year’s host Azerbaijan had last week released the ‘Baku to Belém Roadmap’, detailing how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries to help them implement promised climate actions. Though not a formal conference document, the Roadmap set the tone for brainstorming the issue during the upcoming negotiations.With countries gearing up to discuss contentious issues, including climate finance, UN climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell, while opening the COP30, said, ""Your job here is not to fight one another – your job is to fight this climate crisis, together.""Besides the critical issues of ways and means of mobilising climate finance and the countries’ response to the latest round of climate action pledges (Nationally Determined Contributions) to limit the warming to 1.5 degree Celsius, the setting of agenda on the first day revolved around three more issues, including a request to discuss unilateral trade measures such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the EU-backed proposal on emissions reporting.The CBAM, which is to be implemented from next year, will impose border tax on carbon intensive goods, like iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that enter the 27 European Union nations. It'll put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries, including India, and impact their trade.As part of the other agenda, host Brazil has proposed setting up the Integrated Forum on Climate Change and Trade (IFCCT) to integrate climate and trade policies. It aims to create a unified platform under the WTO to discuss how such integration takes place. Negotiators of over 195 member-countries are expected to finalise the agenda through consensus by Wednesday.India is currently represented by a team of officials from different ministries, including environment, finance and renewable energy.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav will participate in the negotiations during the second week of the conference.","The 30th session of the annual UN climate conference (COP30) kicked off on Monday in Belem, Brazil.

CHENNAI: Thousands of doctors remain without work as NEET PG 2025 counselling for all-India quota seats has been indefinitely delayed. Meanwhile, hospitals, including state-run medical colleges across the country, which engage PG students as workforce, will remain short-staffed as students haven't joined these hospitals.On Nov 6, more than three months after completing the entrance test and hours before students could submit their application for the counselling, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC), under Directorate General of Health Services, said the competent authority has decided to extend the choice-filling of Round 1 of PG counselling 2025 until further notice. The committee said the seat matrix was being revised as the apex regulatory body, National Medical Commission, was adding more PG seats, and the National Board of Examinations (NBE) withdrew 169 PG DNB seats after the start of counselling.Candidates across the country accused the NMC, NBE, and MCC of mismanagement.

Terror Angle in Delhi Blast Not Ruled Out: PM Modi Briefed, Home Minister Amit Shah Calls NIA, NSG

NEW DELHI: The recent operations by the J&K Police and the Gujarat ATS have highlighted an insidious form of radicalisation - the so-called ""white-collar terror ecosystem"". However, what's more concerning is the recovery of common, dual-use materials - such as ricin from castor seeds and ammonium nitrate used in fertilisers - in terror plots.Sources said that this pointed to a critical shift in operational strategy, likely to have been necessitated by the stringent security checks at the borders and on traditional transit routes. This logistical chokehold is prompting terror commanders to have their recruits return to age-old, domestic bomb-making techniques using easily accessible, commercially available materials.Regarding the arrest of doctors, sources said that terror commanders were using Indian recruits who are radicalised but can dodge suspicion and detection by being in a respectable profession, affording Pakistan deniability in the process.The return to low-tech, high-impact techniques presents a fresh challenge for security agencies. According to intelligence officials, this modus operandi is preferred by terrorist groups since the ingredients are legal and sold, virtually over the counter, for legitimate commercial purposes and acquiring them does not immediately raise suspicion, making the planning phase extremely difficult to detect.For example, terrorists are using normal watches as timers in IEDs, in a throwback to the days when Indian Mujahideen used parts of Ajanta brand of wall clocks as timers for bombs they set off in a series of terror attacks at important cities.""This tactic is preferred by terrorist organisations, as ""improvised"" itself means using non-military, accessible components. Even groups in Iraq and Afghanistan (including al-Qaeda and IS) which extensively used IEDs, often used homemade explosives which were triggered by common electronic items like cell phones,"" said a retired intelligence officer. Even the LTTE in Sri Lanka was known for developing sophisticated IEDs and using fertiliser-based explosives in various attacks.The use of Homemade Explosives and readily available components for Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) grants terrorist groups significant leeway for carrying out ISI's plans to engineer high-impact attacks without having to worry about arranging the large amounts needed for explosives like RDX. ""Strategically, this approach is designed to inflict mass disruption and fear by causing violence through everyday items, thereby eroding public safety and generating propaganda that undermines govt stability,"" said another officer.","Recent operations by the J&K Police and the Gujarat ATS have highlighted an insidious form of radicalisation.

NEW DELHI: The capital's air quality continued to deteriorate for the fourth day running, with the city's average AQI inching closer to 'severe' levels on Sunday. The day's average air quality index was recorded at 370, in the upper range of 'very poor', the second worst of the season so far after October 30, when the index was at 373.Delhi woke up to another morning of toxic smog but, just as on the previous day, winds picked up towards late afternoon, providing some relief. The average AQI at 8 am Sunday was 391, close to the 'severe' range that starts from 401. By 11 am, the air remained just as bad, with the AQI at 389. The day's official 24-hour average is taken at 4 pm, when the air had improved a bit.The share of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana on Delhi's PM2.5 levels continues to be low, with the figure dipping to nearly 5% from 8% on Saturday.""The wind speed reached 14-15 kmph in the afternoon. While yesterday the wind was northwesterly, coming from Punjab and Haryana, today it changed to westerly and south-westerly. Thus, the fire farm impact,"" said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet.According to the Centre's Decision Support System (DSS), the share of farm fires was 5.3% on Sunday. The share has been less than 10% so far this season while in the past years it has peaked at over 40%.The DSS did not issue any forecast on the impact of stubble burning for Monday. The air quality early warning system expects the air quality to remain within the very poor category.""The air quality is very likely to be in the very poor category from November 10 to 12,"" it stated. The AQI is expected to stay 'very poor' for the subsequent six days as well, the note added.Meanwhile, the Commissioner for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) said that they are not imposing strict pollution preventive measures under Grap-III.The CAQM issued a statement asserting that in the wake of Delhi's daily average AQI hovering around the higher end of the very poor category in the morning, a review meeting was held on GRAP.""However, the sub-committee, while reviewing the current air quality scenario of Delhi-NCR and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions made available by IMD/IITM, noted that at 10am the hourly average AQI of Delhi was 391... Given that Delhi's daily average AQI has since shown a consistent declining trend, with AQI improving to 370 at 4 pm and further improving to 365 at 5 pm today, with the dynamic model and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions and AQI by IMD/IITM also indicating the overall AQI of Delhi to stay in the 'very poor' category in the coming days, the sub-committee opined that invocation of stage-III of GRAP is not required at the moment,"" CAQM stated.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa pointed to a slew of measure being taken by the city govt, including installing sprinklers, fixing pollution norms for industries etc, while attacking the previous AAP govt, stating that while they let Delhi's pollution worsen for 10 years and expect it to be cleaned in 7 months.""The inaction of pollution of 10 years cannot be fixed in 7 months... AAP commented on the location of the Bawana monitoring station, which was installed by them. They spent money on advertisements and not on fixing pollution. We are working to make the situation better,"" said Sirsa.Delhi, meanwhile, continued to feel the chill, recording a minimum temperature of 11.6 degress Celsius on Sunday, which was three degrees below normal. This was marginally higher than Saturday's season low of 11 degress Celsius. The maximum was 28.1 degrees Celsius, which was a degree above normal.

'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

NEW DELHI: As air quality in the national capital continues to plunge, several Delhi residents gathered at India Gate on Sunday, demanding that the government take concrete policy measures to curb the city’s persistent air pollution crisis. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Priyanka Kakkar also joined the protest, accusing the government of being in “denial” about the problem.Following the same, several protesters were detained for demanding stronger government action against rising pollution levels. The event, described as a “clean air protest,” called on authorities to implement stricter measures to tackle what participants referred to as an ongoing ""air emergency"" which has pushed the air quality index (AQI) close to 600 in some parts of Delhi - a level classified as ""severe."" Participants said their demonstration was peaceful and aimed at drawing attention to what they described as government inaction on the worsening situation.Speaking to reporters at the protest, Kakkar accused the BJP-led Delhi government of manipulating the data and demanding them to be on ground with the public.“People of Delhi are angry because the government of the national capital is in denial. They are not accepting that there is pollution.Rekha Gupta is sitting in her office-home after ordering 13 air purifiers - she should have been here. This is public anger. Because the BJP government didn’t take even a single step to address pollution and everyone knows it this time. The BJP government should have been with the people on the ground and not manipulating the data” she said.One protester said, “We want policies from the government to take action on the worsening situation of air quality. The AQI is touching heights, it’s around 600. In European countries everyone has the right to protest - here when we are protesting peacefully, no one wants to listen. We are being evacuated and not allowed to protest peacefully here. This is very wrong, we are not hurting anyone.”The resident further added, “All we’re saying is no matter whose government it is, common people are dying.

From Sidhu Moose Wala To Canada: Lawrence Bishnoi Gang Expands Threat To Global Punjabi Scene

'Bringing two gangsters back to India a challenge'

NEW DELHI: Indian security agencies have achieved a big breakthrough in their operations against criminals, with the detention of two of most-wanted gangsters -Venkatesh Garg and Bhanu Rana - operating from foreign soil.The detentions were made in Georgia and the US, marking a major success in the effort to dismantle international criminal networks.The first criminal, Venkatesh Garg, was apprehended in Tbilisi. Garg, associated with the gang led by UK-based Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, is wanted in more than 10 criminal cases, including the high-profile murder of a BSP neta in Gurgaon. Garg, a resident of Haryana's Narayangarh, was living in Georgia and recruiting youth from Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and other states for carrying out contract killings.Garg's chief Sangwan belongs to Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and is known for running an organised crime syndicate from London, coordinating extortion, murder and arms-related offences. A team of cops from Delhi and Haryana is learnt to have reached Georgia to expedite Garg's extradition. Cops anticipate that Garg will be brought back to India at the earliest to face trial in over a dozen criminal cases registered against him in Haryana and Punjab.The second detention is that of Bhanu Rana, who was taken into custody in the US. Rana is linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Bishnoi, who hails from Punjab and began his criminal career during student politics, now runs a vast network of hundreds of associates across India and abroad who are involved including heinous crimes, including murder and extortion.The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been implicated in numerous violent crimes, including murder and extortion, and has recently gained notoriety for operating its syndicate from behind bars.Police investigations have revealed that Bhanu Rana's criminal network is deeply entrenched across Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. His name had also previously surfaced during the investigation into a grenade attack in Punjab.Intelligence suggests that some of Rana's associates based in the US are actively connected to Bishnoi's criminal operations. Indian agencies are now working to secure Rana's swift deportation from the US. Multiple accomplices of Rana have already been arrested in India, and he faces numerous chargesheets in several criminal cases.Sources said these detentions abroad exposed a wider network, as over two dozen Indian gangsters are believed to be operating from abroad, running extortion and smuggling rackets by hiring operatives from India.""The detention of both Garg and Rana is a blow to their respective gangs and underscores the commitment of Indian law enforcement to pursue high-value targets across international borders,"" a senior officer said.Sources, however, pointed out that bringing the gangster duo back will be a challenge given the complex extradition procedure, which requires them to submit a range of documents to probe charges prima facie and establish their wanted status.",Venkatesh Garg and Bhanu Rana are two of India's most-wanted gangsters. The detentions were made in Georgia and the US. Garg is associated with the gang led by UK-based Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu.

'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate





NEW DELHI: South African cricket legend Jonty Rhodes has drawn attention to the worsening air quality in Delhi, describing the city’s pollution as “hard to digest” while contrasting it with the clean air of his home in coastal Goa.“Passing through Delhi en route to Ranchi this evening, and as always, it's hard to digest the low levels of air quality here,” Rhodes wrote on X, adding, “Am grateful to be living in a small fishing village in South Goa.” He tagged the post with #AQI and #whats2Bdone.Delhi woke up to a thick layer of smog on Monday, with temperatures dipping to 11.6°C and the city’s air quality remaining in the “very poor” category.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 6:05am showed an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 346.Pollution levels were dangerously high across most monitoring stations. Bawana recorded the worst AQI at 412, followed by Wazirpur (397), Jahangirpuri (394), and Nehru Nagar (386), according to the CPCB’s Sameer app.The capital has been experiencing deteriorating air quality for four consecutive days, edging closer to the “severe” category. Sunday’s average AQI was 370, the second-highest of the season after October 30, when it reached 373.While mornings remained heavily polluted, wind activity later in the day brought slight relief. On Sunday, the AQI measured 391 at 8am and 389 at 11am, improving marginally by 4pm, when the official 24-hour average is recorded.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa pointed to a slew of measure being taken by the city govt, including installing sprinklers, fixing pollution norms for industries etc, while attacking the previous AAP govt, stating that while they let Delhi’s pollution worsen for 10 years and expect it to be cleaned in 7 months.“The inaction of pollution of 10 years cannot be fixed in 7 months. AAP commented on the location of the Bawana monitoring station, which was installed by them. They spent money on advertisements and not on fixing pollution. We are working to make the situation better,” said Sirsa.","South African cricket legend Jonty Rhodes has drawn attention to the worsening air quality in Delhi.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Bill Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Bill Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasised, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritise women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Bill Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years.""""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalysing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.",Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Siddhant Awasthi’s journey through Tesla: From Model 3 to Cybertruck





Siddhant Awasthi’s impact on Tesla and the Cybertruck









Siddhant Awasthi, Tesla’s head of the Cybertruck programme, has announced his departure after more than eight years with the company. Rising from an intern to a senior leadership role, Awasthi played a key part in shaping several of Tesla’s landmark projects, including the Model 3, the Shanghai Gigafactory, and the groundbreaking Cybertruck. In a LinkedIn post, he reflected on his journey, highlighting the challenges and achievements that defined his career. Known for his technical expertise and leadership skills, Awasthi’s exit marks the end of a significant chapter for Tesla, leaving a lasting legacy on the company’s electric vehicle programmes and demonstrating the impact of innovation, dedication, and collaborative effort in advancing Tesla’s mission and shaping the future of sustainable automotive technology worldwide.Awasthi’s career at Tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018. He quickly impressed the leadership with his technical expertise and drive, earning a promotion to engineering manager within two years. This rapid rise continued when he became senior technical programme manager, overseeing the development of the Cybertruck’s 48-volt architecture.By late 2022, as Tesla prepared to start production of the Cybertruck, Awasthi was appointed head of the electric truck programme.He oversaw not only the production ramp-up but also planned future upgrades for Tesla’s high-profile pickup. This trajectory demonstrates both his technical prowess and capacity to lead complex engineering projects at a young age. During his eight-year tenure, Awasthi contributed to multiple core Tesla projects. He was integral to the Model 3 ramp-up, ensuring production efficiency and reliability. He also worked on the Shanghai Gigafactory, helping establish Tesla’s manufacturing footprint in China.His work extended to the development of new electronics and wireless architectures, critical components in Tesla’s advanced electric vehicles. Finally, Awasthi delivered the Cybertruck, Tesla’s most ambitious pickup project to date, known for its futuristic design and advanced technology. His multifaceted contributions showcase a rare blend of engineering skill, programme management, and innovation.In his social media post, Awasthi expressed deep gratitude toward Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership. He called his colleagues “talented, driven, and truly rockstar,” recognising the collaborative effort required to execute Tesla’s high-intensity projects. He also thanked Tesla’s customers for their support, noting that the company’s vehicles have positively impacted lives by improving safety and delivering tangible value.This acknowledgment underscores Awasthi’s perspective on teamwork and mentorship as essential to career growth, as well as his appreciation for the culture and leadership at Tesla. Despite Awasthi’s leadership, the Cybertruck has faced commercial challenges. Tesla initially aimed to produce 250,000 units annually, yet current sales reportedly remain around 25,000 per year. These figures highlight the complexity and unpredictability of launching a revolutionary vehicle.Nonetheless, Awasthi’s role in guiding the Cybertruck from concept to delivery has been significant. His work on vehicle architecture, production ramp-up, and future upgrades demonstrates a lasting legacy on Tesla’s electric truck programme. Reflecting on his time at Tesla, Awasthi described it as a “thrilling journey,” filled with high-intensity work across multiple programmes. From the Model 3 to the Shanghai Gigafactory and finally the Cybertruck, he emphasised the personal and professional growth he experienced.","Siddhant Awasthi has announced his departure from Tesla after eight years.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June.

Billionaire Peter Thiel on how Zohran Mamdani's win is a warning for both Republicans and Democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-peter-thiel-on-how-zohran-mamdanis-win-is-a-warning-for-both-republicans-and-democrats/articleshow/125199151.cms,"HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor





Billionaire investor and PayPal founder Peter Thiel has called the election victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as New York City’s new mayor a sign of deep voter frustration — and a wake-up call for both major political parties in the United States. In comments made to The Free Press recently, Thiel said the results reflect growing disillusionment among younger Americans who feel capitalism is no longer working for them. He warned that ignoring issues like housing affordability and student debt could push more voters toward candidates with radical or left-wing economic ideas.“When 70% of Millennials say they are pro-socialist, we need to do better than simply dismiss them by saying that they are stupid or entitled or brainwashed; we should try and understand why,” Thiel wrote in an email to tech leaders including Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen five years ago — an email that resurfaced online after Mamdani’s win.Thiel said that strict zoning laws and construction limits have benefited older generations who saw their property values rise, but hurt younger people locked out of home ownership.“If you proletarianize the young people, you shouldn’t be surprised if they eventually become communist,” he said.He added that many millennials and Gen Z voters aren’t necessarily ideological socialists but rather disillusioned with the economic system.“It’s more just: ‘Capitalism doesn’t work for me. Or, this thing called capitalism is just an excuse for people ripping you off,’” Thiel said.Political experts say Mamdani’s win underscores how rising living costs are reshaping voter priorities. Pollster Frank Luntz told The Free Press that affordability — not just inflation — has become the defining issue for many Americans, regardless of political party.Thiel echoed that view, saying people are now looking for bold ideas, not small policy fixes. “Incremental attempts haven’t worked,” he said, suggesting that both parties need to take the affordability crisis more seriously.Peter Thiel also reflected on America’s aging population, saying that if socialism does gain ground, it may look different from past revolutions.“If the U.S. becomes socialist, it will be more of an old people’s socialism than a young people’s socialism, where it’s more about free healthcare or something like that,” he said. “The word ‘revolution’ sounds pretty high testosterone and youthful. And today, if it’s a revolution, it’s 70-something grandmothers.”",Peter Thiel says the election of Zohran Mamdani as New York City's new mayor is a wake-up call for both major political parties.

India’s domestic growth cycle may be nearing its lowest point, with several supportive economic factors pointing to a possible rebound in the coming months, according to a report by HSBC Mutual Fund.The report noted that low interest rates, steady liquidity conditions, easing crude oil prices and a normal monsoon are all helping to create a more favourable environment for growth.It stated that “the growth cycle in India may be bottoming out. Interest rate and liquidity cycles, a decline in crude prices, and a normal monsoon are all supportive of a pickup in growth going forward.”While global trade-related uncertainty continues to weigh on private capital expenditure in the short term, HSBC Mutual Fund expects India’s investment cycle to stay on an upward trend over the medium term.As per news agency ANI, this growth will be supported by government-led spending on infrastructure and manufacturing, a revival in private sector investment, and a strengthening real estate market.The fund also anticipates stronger private investments in renewable energy, localisation of high-end technology components, and deeper integration into global supply chains—all of which could further drive economic expansion.On the equity front, the report mentioned that Nifty valuations are slightly above their ten-year average, but it remains “constructive on Indian equities” given the country’s resilient medium-term outlook.However, HSBC Mutual Fund cautioned that weak global growth, policy uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions could continue to pose risks.Possible threats include tariff measures, protectionist trade policies, and a slowdown in government capital expenditure.Despite these headwinds, the report pointed to several positives. Private sector investment recovery remains strong, supported by high capacity utilisation levels as per Reserve Bank of India data.Additionally, the ongoing expansion of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is expected to further encourage investment in key industries.Concluding its outlook, the report said that higher private capex in renewable energy, combined with favourable domestic conditions, is likely to sustain India’s economic momentum over the medium term.","India’s domestic growth cycle may be nearing its lowest point, with several supportive economic factors pointing to a possible rebound in the coming months, according to a report by HSBC Mutual Fund.

While there is concern that the return from AI stocks will take much longer-than-expected presently, it is a fact that there is no bubble yet in AI stocks, particularly when compared to the Tech bubble which crashed in 2000. In March 2000 Nasdaq PE was above 70 and many tech stocks were trading above 150 PE.Now Nasdaq is trading at 32 PE and the valuations of AI stocks range from 28 to 51. Therefore, the AI trade may continue for some more time, and so long as this trade persists, FIIs, particularly hedge funds, may continue to sell in India. This will weigh on Indian markets.”“Investors have to give priority to valuations and safety now. While Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, is trading at 51 times earnings, Indian retail investors are investing in IPOs priced at 230 times earnings. These are dangerous, unhealthy trends. Time for caution.”Asian equities continued their upward movement for the second day as developments towards resolving the prolonged US government shutdown boosted market sentiment, leading to gains across assets including commodities and cryptocurrencies.Gold prices reached a near three-week peak on Tuesday, driven by increasing anticipation of another US Federal Reserve interest rate reduction in December, enhancing the appeal of the safe-haven asset.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 4,114 crore net on Monday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

What happened to UAE's Iceberg Project?

The fine line between innovation and spectacle





In a region where rain is rare and water more precious than oil, the United Arab Emirates once had its sights set on an audacious engineering marvel: towing a gigantic Antarctic iceberg to its sun-baked coast to quench thirst, summon clouds, and maybe even reshape climate patterns. But as of 2025, the only glacier ice that has made it to Dubai is not floating off the coast but chilling highball glasses in rooftop bars, courtesy of a boutique Greenland startup.Launched in 2017 by the National Advisor Bureau Limited, a private Abu Dhabi-based company, the UAE Iceberg Project sought to tow a massive tabular iceberg, measuring roughly 2 kilometers long by 500 meters wide, from Antarctica to Fujairah, a coastal emirate on the Gulf of Oman.The logic, according to Abdulla Alshehi, the firm’s managing director and the project’s chief architect, was straightforward: an average iceberg holds over 20 billion gallons of fresh water, enough to supply 1 million people for five years. “This is the purest water in the world,” he told Gulf News in 2017. And the UAE, consuming 15% of the world’s desalinated water and facing depleting groundwater within 15 years, was in no position to ignore unconventional ideas.The iceberg, selected via satellite near Heard Island in the Southern Ocean, would undertake a 12,000-kilometer (≈6,480 nautical miles), 10-month journey across the Southern, Indian, and Arabian Seas to reach the coast of Fujairah in the UAE. Towed by large ocean-going vessels, it would travel northward through the Indian Ocean before entering the Gulf of Oman.Upon arrival, it would be stationed roughly 3 kilometers off Fujairah’s coast. Immediately, harvesting would begin efficiently, with the aim of extracting potable water within two to three months before significant melting occurs. Computer simulations commissioned by the company projected that up to 30% of the iceberg’s mass could be lost during the long journey, a challenge the team hopes to mitigate by timing its arrival during the UAE’s winter season, when sea temperatures are lower and melting would naturally slow.To prevent breakup during the long journey, Alshehi’s firm developed a patent-pending metal belt, a kind of reinforced corset designed to hold the iceberg intact against wave stress and temperature gradients. In 2020, the UK Intellectual Property Office granted Alshehi a patent for his invention, called the ""Iceberg Reservoirs"" system. The patent was promoted as a credibility boost to attract investment and reinforce the project's technical feasibility.A pilot project, costed between $60–80 million, was announced for 2019. A smaller iceberg was to be towed to Cape Town or Perth as proof of concept. The full UAE project carried a price tag of $100–150 million.Despite a splashy website launch (www.icebergs.world), promises of scientific panels, and a vision of global humanitarian water relief, no trial was ever confirmed to have taken place. As of 2025, there’s been no operational progress, no updated logistics, and no official cancellation, just prolonged silence.What made the proposal especially memorable was its near-mystical secondary goal: climate engineering. Alshehi claimed that the presence of a colossal iceberg floating off the UAE coast could induce localized weather changes.“Cold air gushing from an iceberg close to the Arabian Sea would cause a trough and rainstorms,” he told local media. The iceberg, he argued, could “create a vortex” that would attract clouds from across the region, generating year-round rain for the desert interior. This, he claimed, could help reverse desertification and transform arid landscapes into lush, green areas, with benefits for agriculture, biodiversity, and the broader ecosystem.Meteorologists weren’t sold. While some acknowledged localized effects, like minor cloud formation due to temperature differentials, experts like Linda Lam from Weather.com said sustained, regional rainstorms were unlikely due to the complex nature of atmospheric dynamics.The UAE’s acute water issues form the bedrock of the project’s rationale. The country experiences a paltry 120 millimeters of rainfall annually, and according to a 2015 Associated Press report, its groundwater could be fully depleted within 15 years. Meanwhile, the Gulf states have among the highest water usage rates in the world: around 500 liters per person per day.Desalination, though critical, is energy-intensive, costly, and environmentally damaging. Alshehi warned of desalination plants pumping concentrated brine back into the Gulf, increasing salinity and harming marine life. His iceberg initiative, he claimed, would be not only cheaper in the long run but eco-friendlier, despite concerns about dragging a 100,000-year-old ice mass across the globe.He asserted that environmental impact assessments had been conducted, and results suggested minimal disruption to ecosystems,though no independent third-party review was ever published.While Alshehi’s Antarctic ambitions appear stalled in bureaucratic limbo, a smaller, scrappier company in Greenland has quietly realized a modest version of his vision,not as a humanitarian water source, but as luxury indulgence.Founded in 2022 by Greenlandic entrepreneurs, Arctic Ice ships ice harvested from Greenland’s fjords to high-end bars and restaurants in Dubai. Their first commercial shipment, around 22 metric tonnes, arrived recently, offering the “cleanest H₂O on Earth” to be shaved into ice cubes for cocktails, ice baths, and facial massages in Dubai’s spas.The process is artisanal: Using a crane-equipped boat, workers collect naturally calved icebergs from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord near Nuuk. Only the clearest, bubble-free ice, locally known as “black ice,” is selected. These are believed to be over 100,000 years old, having never touched soil or contaminants.Each chunk is cut with sanitized chainsaws, stored in food-grade insulated crates, and sampled for lab analysis to screen for ancient microorganisms or harmful bacteria. The ice is shipped via refrigerated containers aboard cargo ships already returning empty from Greenland, minimizing additional emissions. The second leg, from Denmark to Dubai, completes the frozen supply chain.Despite the company’s carbon-neutral commitment, backlash has been fierce. Critics online lambast the concept as “climate dystopia,” arguing that glacial ice should not be commodified, especially given the accelerating melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Co-founder Malik V. Rasmussen says some messages have verged on death threats.Still, Arctic Ice insists it is creating economic opportunity for a financially dependent Greenland, where 55% of the budget is subsidized by Denmark. “We make all our money from fish and tourism,” Rasmussen said. “I’ve always wanted to find something else we can profit from.”Both projects,the giant iceberg tow from Antarctica and the boutique glacier cubes from Greenland, highlight a pressing tension: how far will humanity go to secure water, and at what cost?Alshehi’s vision is bold but fraught with logistical and ethical challenges. Icebergs aren’t endlessly renewable, and towing them across hemispheres feels more sci-fi than sustainable.Arctic Ice’s venture, meanwhile, has found a controversial niche,combining novelty, luxury, and symbolism. In a time of climate anxiety, it offers an icy illusion of control, frozen fragments of a melting world, crafted into cocktail spheres.Whether climate solution or spectacle, these ideas raise key questions: Who owns natural ice? Can it be harvested responsibly? And as water scarcity grows, how do we balance local needs with global care?For now, the UAE’s giant iceberg remains a dream deferred, and Dubai’s cocktails are as cold as ever, just sourced from a little farther north, and in smaller, sparkling doses.","The UAE Iceberg Project planned to tow a massive Antarctic iceberg 6,480 nautical miles to Fujairah.

Markets watch: Asian stocks rise as US shutdown nears end; oil prices stay under pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/markets-watch-asian-stocks-rise-as-us-shutdown-nears-end-oil-prices-stay-under-pressure/articleshow/125238844.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





Asian stocks continued to climb for a second straight day on Tuesday as signs emerged that US lawmakers were close to resolving the country’s record-long government shutdown.The positive sentiment also lifted global markets, though oil prices remained subdued amid concerns about oversupply and slowing demand.At 0230 GMT, the Nikkei was up 0.4% at 51,131.28, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged 0.1% higher to 26,680.73, while Shanghai slipped 0.3% to 4,008.61.In Washington, senators on Monday night passed a compromise budget deal after several Democrats sided with Republicans to fund government departments through January.If the measure clears the House of Representatives, the government could reopen by Friday. “It appears to us this morning that our long national nightmare is finally coming to an end,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said, while President Donald Trump told reporters that the deal was “very good” and that the country would be “opening up very quickly.”According to Reuters, the progress in Washington boosted risk appetite across markets, with Japan, South Korea, and Australia opening higher.The S&P 500 jumped 1.5% on Monday and the Nasdaq 100 gained 2.2%, while the MSCI All Country World Index recorded its best session since June.Commodities, cryptocurrencies, and industrial metals such as aluminium and copper also saw gains.The dollar weakened, while gold and Bitcoin rallied.Analysts said the reopening would help restore the flow of key US data on jobs and inflation, which could guide the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate decision. “Reopening would not only boost sentiment but also open the way for data releases,” said Fiona Cincotta of City Index, as quoted by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, oil prices were weighed down by rising production and sanctions-related disruptions.Brent crude slipped 0.4% to $63.83 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate dropped to $59.90, according to AFP.As per Reuters, while optimism over the US budget deal supported broader market sentiment, “worries about crude oversupply” limited oil’s recovery.Analysts at energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates noted that as OPEC production continues to rise, “global oil balances are acquiring an increasingly bearish hue” due to weaker demand and slower growth in major consuming nations.Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to increase December output targets by 137,000 barrels per day, the same pace as in previous months, but will pause hikes in the first quarter of next year.Adding to oil market jitters, new US sanctions on Russian firms Rosneft and Lukoil had begun to bite. Lukoil reportedly declared force majeure at its Iraqi oil field, and Bulgaria prepared to seize its Burgas refinery. The sanctions have also caused a surge in crude stored in Asian waters as exports to China and India fell.Some refiners in both countries have turned to Middle Eastern suppliers instead.Ritterbusch analysts added that a key uncertainty for oil’s outlook “is the extent to which China will continue to push Russian supplies into strategic stockpiles and whether India will succumb to Trump’s suggestions to defer further purchases from Russia.","Nikkei was up 0.4% at 51,131.28, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged 0.1% higher to 26,680.73, while Shanghai slipped 0.3% to 4,008.61.

Intel AI chief and chief technology officer Sachin Katti has left to join ChatGPT-maker OpenAI . In a statement, the chip maker said that its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, will now oversee the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) division. “We thank Sachin for his contributions and wish him all the best. Lip-Bu will lead the AI and Advanced Technologies Groups, working closely with the team,” Intel said. “AI remains one of Intel’s highest strategic priorities, and we are focused on executing our technology and product roadmap across emerging AI workloads,” the company added.Katti, who joined Intel four years ago and previously taught at Stanford University, was promoted to chief technology officer and chief AI officer earlier this year. His exit marks another leadership change under Tan, who took over as Intel’s CEO in March and has since restructured the company.Intel has been working to catch up in the AI chip market, where Nvidia and TSMC currently dominate. While its central processors power some AI systems, the company has yet to produce a competitive data center AI chip.Tan has been reshaping Intel’s leadership, expanding executive roles and hiring new talent from outside the company as he attempts to steer a turnaround at the struggling chipmaker.Sharing a post on X, OpenAI President Greg Brockman said:Katti responded, writing:","Intel AI chief and chief technology officer Sachin Katti has left to join ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.
