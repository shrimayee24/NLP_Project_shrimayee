This translates to a price of Rs 1.18 lakh per sq feet on super area and Rs 1.82 lakh per square feet on carpet area.

Although they had never met in person, the two had grown close through the social media platform, sharing countless conversations and pictures. Their families, too, had agreed on the wedding arrangements over the phone, and everything seemed set for the big day.On the morning of the wedding, Deepak, along with his family and 150 guests, traveled from their village, Mandiali in Jalandhar, to the wedding location in Moga. The bride's family had given clear instructions about the venue, ""Rose Garden Palace.""But upon arriving in Moga, the groom couldn’t find the venue and was told that someone would escort them to the venue. Hours passed with no one showing up.By 5 pm, still no one had arrived, and after questioning locals, they were left shocked to learn that there was no such place as ""Rose Garden Palace"" in Moga.Deepak and his family attempted to contact Kaur, but her phone was switched off, and they were left stranded in the middle of the town.

PILIBHIT: The night is its own predator on UP's highways as it snakes through hiding unseen dangers: speeding trucks, sudden turns, and then, out of nowhere, the dark silhouette of a stray bull, standing still as if daring fate itself. These highways, essential veins of transit, have become ready stages for nocturnal collisions, where cattle and humans lose their lives to a moment's invisibility.Last month, UP launched a deceptively simple solution. It taped fluorescent reflective strips around necks and horns of stray cattle. These strips, glowing under a vehicle's headlights, are meant to save lives in the dark. And they have, said officials, though the claims are yet to be backed by data.In Pilibhit, where the initiative began, the task of turning bovines into beacons has proven both bold and fraught, with challenges as daunting as the creatures it seeks to protect.On three major highways - Bareilly-Haridwar NH-74, Pilibhit-Basti NH-730, and Bhind-Lipulekh NH-731 - workers tagged 450 stray bulls with reflective tapes. The initiative, costing Rs 400 per cow or bull, is aimed at making animals visible, particularly those with black coats that blend into the night. ""It's an ambitious project,"" said assistant regional transport officer Virendra Singh, who is spearheading the effort. Villagers played a crucial role, not only supporting the initiative but funding much of its cost.Yet, the effort was anything but smooth. Field teams lacked protective equipment or tranquilisation tools, exposing them to life-threatening attacks from the very animals they were trying to save. ""Our personnel succeeded only because of the active support of local villagers,"" Singh admitted. ""But without proper safety measures, we cannot extend the initiative further.""Pilibhit's reflective tape initiative had an earlier inspiration, though. In 2016, NGO Neki Ki Deevar launched a similar effort, tagging 350-odd stray bulls and cows with reflective tapes in Puranpur before extending it to Sitapur and Kheri. However, escalating dangers & logistical shortfalls forced the project to soon halt.","Pilibhit, Uttar Pradesh, launched scheme last month to tag stray bulls with reflective tapes.

HYDERABAD: At just 22 years old, Mohammad Khaleel Ghori has lived a life marked by incredible transitions, heartbreak, and rediscovery in a world often divided by religion and identity. Over the past decade, he has lived through three distinct identities - Khaleel, Altaf, and Abhinav Singh - each shaped by different circumstances.Born and raised in Hyderabad, he vanished from his home at the age of 12, sparking a journey that would see him adopt new identities, religions, and families over the next decade.Khaleel's disappearance in 2014 began innocuously enough. ""It was a day before the Samagra Kutumba Survey. We sent Khaleel with his cousin to photocopy our documents,"" recalled his mother Sara. ""He sent the papers back, saying he'd return later. Hours turned into days, and days into years, but he never came back.""Sara spent the next decade searching for her son. ""I'm happy he is finally back,"" she said.Khaleel remembers little from his early years in Hyderabad. ""Before boarding a train to Delhi, I vaguely remember living with a man who told me my name was Altaf and that I had no family. That stayed with me, and I lived by it for the last 10 years,"" he said Saturday. He eventually landed in a shelter home in Ghaziabad, assuming the name Altaf.Three years ago, he was adopted by a Hindu family from Kanpur, who named him Abhinav Singh. ""Outside school, I didn't have many friends (in my adopted home). I spent my time studying or helping my mother with chores. I'm my sister's stressbuster. Whenever she was in a bad mood or stressed about her preparations to become a govt teacher, I entertained her with my playful antics,"" Khaleel said.""I will miss my (adopted) sister the most,"" he said. Khaleel's return to his biological family was triggered when his adoptive parents tried to get him an Aadhaar card . His original Aadhaar details surfaced when his biometrics were entered, leading Hyderabad police to track him down.On December 1, Khaleel met his biological mother and brother for the first time in a decade. ""I was taken to meet two people I had never met before. I was told they were my biological mother and brother. I couldn't recognise them, but they had all the proof - childhood photos, school records, even my Aadhaar card,"" he said.Khaleel now faces complex challenges, including navigating conflicting identity documents. His educational records list him as Abhinav Singh, while his original documents identify him as Khaleel, creating hurdles in continuing his education.“We don’t know what to do now. His records show him as Abhinav, with his adoptive family ’s details — father’s name, mother’s name, and address. He scored well in class 10 and 11 — 83% and 70% — but we might have to re-enrol him in class 10,” said Aqeel, his brother. To complicate matters further, Kanpur records list him as a 16-year-old, while his actual age is 22.Neuropsychiatrist Charan Teja Koganti from KIMS Hospital in Hyderabad suggested that Khaleel might be experiencing dissociative amnesia . “When someone goes through trauma or neglect, the brain blocks out all important people or events. They even forget their identity. They form a new identity, either by themselves or given by someone else.”","Mohammad Khaleel Ghori has lived a life marked by incredible transitions, heartbreak, and rediscovery. He vanished from his home at the age of 12, sparking a journey that would see him adopt new identities, religions, and families over the next decade. Over the past decade, he has lived through three distinct identities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116089625,imgsize-662882,width-400,resizemode-4/116089625.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Amid multiple suits being filed across country by Hindus seeking claim over religious places of Muslims alleging that they were earlier temples but converted to mosques during Mughal era and the lower court entertaining such pleas allegedly in violation of Places of Worship Act , SC will hear pleas challenging validity of the law which barred any litigation to change the character of a religious place from what it was at the time of Independence.A three-judge bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan will hear a batch of petitions seeking quashing of the law on Dec 12.A five-judge bench, while pronouncing the Ayodhya verdict , had approved the law and held that Places of Worship Act 'imposes a non-derogable obligation towards enforcing our commitment to secularism"" and it is a legislative instrument designed to protect secular features of Indian polity, which is one of the basic features of the Constitution. The verdict, reportedly penned by Justice D Y Chandrachud, said in no uncertain terms that historical wrongs cannot be remedied by people taking the law in their own hands and Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress present and future.""This court cannot entertain claims that stem from actions of Mughal rulers against Hindu places of worship in a court of law today. For any person who seeks solace or recourse against actions of any number of ancient rulers, the law is not the answer. Our history is replete with actions that have been judged to be morally incorrect and even today are liable to trigger vociferous ideological debate. However, adoption of the Constitution marks a watershed moment where we, the people of India, departed from determination of rights and liabilities on the basis of our ideology, religion, colour of skin, or the century when our ancestors arrived at these lands, and submitted to the rule of law,"" the verdict said.Months after the Ayodhya verdict, petitions were filed in SC challenging validity of the law on grounds of being ""arbitrary and unreasonable and infringing the fundamental right to practice religion"". The petitioners included BJP's Ashwini Upadhyay, Subramanian Swamy and other Hindu organisations seeking to open litigation routes for ownership claims over disputed sites like those at Kashi and Mathura.During hearing on disputes involving Gyanvapi mosque, a bench headed by Justice Chandrachud observed that ascertaining the religious character of a place of worship was not barred under Places of Worship Act which emboldened others to seek court-mandated surveys like, most recently in Sambhal and Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's shrine in Ajmer.",Supreme Court to hear pleas challenging validity of Places of Worship Act.

OCCRP refuted the report calling it “simply wrong”.In its response, it said, “OCCRP has no limits on its journalism and no donor influences our reporting.

NEW DELHI: Political confrontation on BJP's allegation about Congress's links with US-based currency manipulator and hedge fund operator George Soros looks unlikely to abate soon with the party in power rejecting the demand for an apology.""I stand by what I said because I spoke on the basis of facts they have not been able to dispute. In fact, I could not get to ask all the 10 questions I had planned to and will exercise my right to defend myself under Rule 357 to produce my entire chargesheet, should they insist on apology,"" said Nishikant Dubey, BJP member who levelled the charge in Lok Sabha on Thursday and doubled it down on Friday to rile the opposition party further with his ""Congress ka haath, Soros ke Saath"" jibe.Citing the claims made by French media outlet Mediapart, BJP, in both Houses, said on Thursday that Soros, through his proxies like the Open Society Foundation , Human Rights Watch, and Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), has consistently timed his ""false propaganda"" to coincide with Parliament sessions in India, which were then used by Congress leaders, with Rahul Gandhi taking the lead.Importantly, despite US embassy's protests against the saffron party's attempt to establish a link between the investigative journalism project and the State Department, BJP stuck to its charge that OCCRP was a project of the US department. ""It is a matter of fact. It is for them to figure out whether those behind the false propaganda against India exceeded their brief as part of a deep state operation,"" said Dubey as he made light of US embassy's complaint against BJP's statement.BJP's charge is based on Mediapart's claims that OCCRP derived a substantial part of its funding from the US and other western countries like the UK, France, Switzerland and Sweden. US's share alone stood at 53%, though OCCRP's Drew Sullian puts it at 46%. More importantly, it was created by US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. In fact, it owes its creation to David Hodkinson, formerly of US army who was deployed in 25 countries. A reservist now, he works for the US Director of National Intelligence as a colonel (retd).Mediapart, relying on the statements of Sullivan, summed up OCCRP's position vis-a-vis the US govt as of ""structural dependency"", since it is constrained from doing stories on US matters because of ""conflict of interest"" and because it is governed by the US Foreign Services Act that its activities is ""aligned with and advance US foreign policy of economic sanctions"". In an 2023 email to the OCCRP staff, Sullvan explained that the group will not do stories on the US because all of its budget was paid for by Washington and the Open Society Foundation of Soros.BJP's annoyance with Soros, who has made no secret of his dislike for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has included him in the list of targets, which also include US President-elect Donald Trump, is not new. It has also accused him of working in league with Congress.But it is Mediapart's disclosure about OCCRP, whose claims regarding Pegasus spyware, efficacy of anti-Covid vaccines developed in India, and currency manipulation by Adani Group, were seized upon by Congress and others to disrupt proceedings of Parliament, being backed by a US govt agency and Soros, appears to have encouraged the saffron strategists to turn their grievance into a full-scale campaign.Beginning Thursday, there has been a flood of posts on X, where party officials and supporters shared snippets of information, claiming that Congress, through its leaders like Rahul Gandhi, was in cahoots with Soros to push an agenda to undermine and defame the Modi government.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey rile the opposition party further with his ""Congress ka haath, Soros ke Saath"" jibe.

NEW DELHI: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh 's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.In a letter, Bukhari stressed the close ties between India and Bangladesh. “Since the establishment of Bangladesh, our national leadership, media, civil society, and influential circles have maintained close relations with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajid, and their party, the Awami League. In diplomacy, regional matters, international affairs, and issues concerning the Muslim world, Bangladesh has always stood by us as a close ally,” he said, according to an ANI report.Bukhari expressed concern over the unrest following Sheikh Hasina's departure to India, which has affected both Muslim and non-Muslim supporters of the Awami League. He specifically condemned the violence targeting the Hindu minority.“Until now, this remained an internal matter of Bangladesh. However, the ongoing injustices, assaults, and unilateral actions against the Hindu minority are condemnable and must stop immediately. There is no justification for such actions. The government must always acknowledge the role we have played in their establishment and development process, as well as our unparalleled history of supporting and caring for millions of refugees. We were the first to stand by them during every natural disaster,” he wrote.Bukhari also referred to the UN's declaration on minority rights, calling on Yunus to intervene. “As a credible neighbour, a close ally of Bangladesh, and a custodian of shared cultural heritage, I expect the current head of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, to take immediate steps to address the injustices against the Hindu minority. He should ensure that his international reputation remains untarnished. As a Muslim-majority country, Islam and Islamic jurisprudence inherently leave no room for any form of prejudice or injustice against minorities in Bangladesh,” Bukhari added.Over the weekend, more than 60 monks were reportedly stopped from entering India at the Benapole land port in Bangladesh, according to an ANI report citing an ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson. Additionally, a Bangladesh court has set January 2, 2025, as the hearing date for Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das , who was arrested on sedition charges. Das is currently in custody in Bangladesh.","Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi, has criticised the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. He urged Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government, to take immediate action against these injustices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115942823,imgsize-688125,width-400,resizemode-4/115942823.jpg"

Deshaun Watson will not face any suspension or fine from the NFL

The NFL has finished investigating sexual assault allegations against Deshaun Watson , the quarterback for the Cleveland Browns , and said that it did not suffice with evidence that it violated any part of the personal conduct policy. Watson is accused in a new lawsuit, filed after the season opener, of having committed sexual assault and battery. The attorneys for both parties confirmed that the case was resolved in October, and a confidential settlement was announced by attorney Tony Buzbee.Deshaun Watson, the Cleveland Browns quarterback, will not face any suspension or fine from the NFL for a sexual assault accusation made against him in September. ""The matter is closed,"" an NFL spokesperson told Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot on Friday. ""There was insufficient evidence to support a finding of a violation of the personal conduct policy.”The lawsuit was filed in Harris County , Texas, in which claims were made, that is, Watson and Jane Doe, whom he is said to have sexually misbehaved with in October 2020 earlier, just prior to the converged dinner at Watson's apartment. Watson denied the allegations in a statement by his lawyer Rusty Hardin. The NFL has assessed the complaint under its personal conduct policy, but did not place Watson on the commissioner exempt list because of the absence of formal charges and the review just started.Watson was suspended for a period of 11 games in 2022 after more than two dozen women alleged that he had sexually assaulted and acted inappropriately during massage therapy sessions. Following a settlement with the NFL and the Players Association, Watson was fined $5 million and required to undergo an examination by behavior specialists before being reinstated by the league. Watson settled most of the lawsuits against him, claiming 23 out of the 24 he faced during the summer of 2022.The lawsuit, which was instituted in September, is in no way connected to the two live lawsuits, one of which was instituted in the summer of 2022 and the other one initiated in October 2022, by women who have accused Watson of a sexual offense during massage sessions. Watson began seven games this season before suffering a right Achilles tendon tear in Week 7 that would sideline him for the remainder of the season. He has recorded the lowest total QBR in the entire league.Also Read: The NFL has revealed 32 nominees for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award 2024 Having traded three first-round picks to Houston for Watson and backed up their trade with a backfired $230 million contract, the Browns will still have to pay Watson $46 million in each of the following two seasons. So far, in a span of three seasons, Watson has only played 19 games owing to suspension and injuries. But even with all these, part of the huge implications of their contract with him and his salary are heavy chains for the Browns as they're looking to improve their team.","Deshaun Watson will not face any suspension or fine from the NFL for a sexual assault accusation made against him in September.

Tayvoodoo In Action? What Taylor Swift’s New Spotify Win Could Mean For Travis Kelce and the NFL



Spotify 2024 Wrapped - Taylor Swift Global Top Artist of the Year

The Spotify Wrapped 2024 is here, and is it any wonder that Taylor Swift has ranked as the No. 1 most-streamed artist globally in 2024 on Spotify, for the second year in a row? With over 26.6 billion streams, Swift’s latest album, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, also became the most-streamed album worldwide. The album broke some major records with over 300 million streams on its first day and 1 billion in its first week!“That’s right, it’s Taylor Swift!” Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s Global Head of Editorial, announced in a virtual press briefing. “With more than 26.6 billion streams globally this year, Taylor is our Global Top Artist for the second year in a row.”There’s no doubt that 2024 has been a milestone year for Taylor; besides the record-breaking sales of her music, her Eras Tour also became the highest-grossing concert tour of all time, as per a Pollstar data. The data also says that the tour is the first ever to gross $1 billion. On the personal front too, 2024 has been kind to Taylor as she has managed to cement her romance with Kansas City Chief’s Travis Kelce.In fact, just a day after Thanksgiving, Taylor, donning an ""87"" necklace in honor of Travis' number, joined Travis's mom Donna Kelce at the Kansas City Chiefs' game against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 29. Taylor’s dad Scott Swift also joined the happy gathering. It’s safe to say things are moving fast for the Swift-Kelce romance and fans have come up with several theories on Taylor’s influence on Travis Kelce and NFL.Fans have coined the term ‘Tayvoodoo’ to describe the Grammy winner’s influence on Travis’s games. Travis and Jason Kelce referred to the phenomenon on December 4, during the episode of their “New Heights” podcast. “Rookie of the Year, there’s so many good ones. Angels in the Outfield. I’d love to f—-ing feel what it’s like,” Travis referred to the 1994 film, which follows an underdog basketball team.Jason said, “I feel like you guys [the Kansas City Chiefs] are the Angels in the Outfield. There’s some unknown like …”“Here you go with this f–ing Tayvoodoo s–t again,” Travis said. “This dude is such a d–khead.” The tight end has had a slow season this year; Kelce has only managed 569 yards through 11 games, and his touchdown count is stuck at just two, which is unusual for someone like Kelce who is known for his consistency. However, Taylor’s influence has introduced millions of fans to the world of the NFL, which has also helped Travis’s profile, despite an underwhelming year. The Chiefs vs. Jets game featuring Taylor in the stands hit 27 million viewers—the highest number of non-Super Bowl Sunday viewers.It’s important to remember that the NFL is a league that thrives on ratings, advertisements and commercial popularity. Whether Taylor’s cheering for him in the stands or the couple is spotted her shows, Taylor’s star power has definitely helped the NFL player and his league. Earlier this year, he signed a two-year extension worth $34 million. His jersey sales reportedly spiked by 400% after the couple started dating. The league clearly approves of Taylor’s influence on Travis’ popularity, which doesn’t just draw in more crowd but also translates to commercial gains for the league.The NFL enjoyed a record-breaking holiday period, the Chiefs-Raiders Thanksgiving showdown saw a significant jump in viewership compared to last year's Miami Dolphins-New York Jets game. As per some reports, the ‘Swift bump’ has led to a 20 per cent increase in sponsorships for the NFL and viewership has increased by 53 per cent among teenage female viewers.Now that Taylor is Spotify’s most streamed artist, chances are influence will also translate into enhanced global popularity for the NFL. By catering to the Swifties, the NFL is tapping into a new market, exploring avenues for growth through pop culture intersections. Collaborations or promotions that include Taylor’s music could create unique experiences for fans.Following Taylor’s Spotify win, ror the first time, Spotify is adding a Wrapped badge to Taylor Swift’s Spotify profile. Moreover, Spotify is launching an Easter egg experience for Swifties as listeners can now see custom mini-animations tailored to the eras of Taylor’s discography on the app’s play button, while listening to her songs. Moreover, following a new partnership with Snapchat, Swifties can now go for 2024 Wrapped bracelets featuring a Global Top Artist Badge charm through an AR lens in the Snapchat app.Also read: What Taylor Swift’s Spotify Wrapped 2024 Win Means for the NFL and Travis Kelce","Taylor Swift has ranked as the No. 1 most-streamed artist globally in 2024 on Spotify, for the second year in a row.

The Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), commonly known as the Provident Fund (PF), is a compulsory savings and retirement plan established for employees working in eligible organisations.

Why Sam Altman says he is not worried

""I don’t think Elon would do it,"" Altman said, emphasizing that the public would not tolerate any misuse of political power for business gain.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed confidence that Tesla CEO Elon Musk would not use his influence with President-elect Donald Trump to undermine business rivals, calling such actions ""profoundly un-American."" Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, on November 4, Altman addressed concerns surrounding Musk's new role as head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Trump administration. There are worries in some quarters that Musk might leverage the position to benefit his own companies.Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been quite open about his 'dislike' for OpenAI CEO Altman.He added that, despite Musk’s polarizing persona, using political power for personal gain would go against values Musk holds dear.Altman said.Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before departing from the organization, is currently suing OpenAI and Microsoft.

He has also sought a federal court order to block OpenAI's transition to a more profit-driven model.Musk claims that they have strayed from the nonprofit mission originally envisioned for the company. Musk has also launched xAI, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, is now valued at $50 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable startups.Altman called the ongoing legal dispute with Musk ""tremendously sad,"" reflecting on a time when he viewed Musk as a ""mega hero.""Musk, who has become a close ally of Trump, was heavily involved in the 2016 presidential campaign, spending over $100 million to support Trump's bid and attending rallies. He has remained a prominent figure in the Trump administration’s transition, reportedly even joining a call when Google CEO Sundar Pichai congratulated Trump on his election victory.Musk's businesses, including SpaceX and Tesla, maintain significant ties with both U.S. and foreign governments.

Why stray cattle on UP's highways are 'glowing' at night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/why-stray-cattle-on-ups-highways-are-glowing-at-night/articleshow/116095838.cms,"'Success only because of the active support of local villagers'

PILIBHIT: The night is its own predator on UP's deadly highways as it snakes through hiding unseen dangers: speeding trucks, sudden turns, and then, out of nowhere, the dark silhouette of a stray bull, standing still as if daring fate itself. These highways, essential veins of commerce and transit, have become ready stages for nocturnal collisions, where cattle and humans lose their lives to a moment's invisibility.Last month, UP launched a deceptively simple solution. It taped fluorescent reflective strips around the necks and horns of stray cattle . These strips of light, glowing under a vehicle's headlights, are meant to save lives in the dark. And they have, said officials, though the claims are yet to be backed by data. In Pilibhit, where the initiative began, the task of turning bovines into beacons has proven both bold and fraught, with challenges as daunting as the creatures it seeks to protect.On three major highways - Bareilly-Haridwar NH-74, Pilibhit-Basti NH-730, and Bhind-Lipulekh NH-731 - teams of workers tagged 450 stray bulls with reflective tapes. The initiative, which cost Rs 400 per cow or bull, aimed to make these animals visible, particularly those with black coats that blend seamlessly into the night.It's an ambitious project,"" said assistant regional transport officer Virendra Singh, who is spearheading the effort. Villagers played a crucial role, not only supporting the initiative but funding much of its cost. Yet, the effort was anything but smooth. Field teams lacked protective equipment or tranquilisation tools, exposing them to life-threatening attacks from the very animals they were trying to save. ""Our personnel succeeded only because of the active support of local villagers,"" Singh admitted. ""But without proper safety measures, we cannot extend the initiative further.""In 2019, the district counted over 10,043 stray cattle in Pilibhit alone. Many were housed in the 61 operational shelters, but large chunks roam around - on the streets, in the fields and farms of people. Dr Arvind Garg, the chief veterinary officer of Pilibhit, echoed the need for specialised equipment. ""Many of these bulls require sedation before we can approach them safely. Without dart guns or blowguns, manual injections are highly risky,"" he said.Garg added: ""In 2019, Pilibhit district had 140,000 cows, 30% of which were capable of conceiving. Male calves constitute over 51% of all births. So, approximately 20,000 bulls are born each year. These bulls are often abandoned by cowkeepers, adding to the ever-growing stray population."" This cycle of abandonment-driven by economic realities and cultural practices-ensures that stray bulls continue to haunt highways, multiplying risks from themselves and travelling humans.Pilibhit's reflective tape initiative had an earlier inspiration, though. In 2016, the social organisation Neki Ki Deevar launched a similar effort, tagging 350-odd stray bulls and cows with reflective tapes in Puranpur tehsil before briefly extending it to Sitapur and Kheri. However, escalating dangers and logistical shortfalls forced the project to halt within a year. Gurmel Singh, the founder of Neki Ki Deevar, recounted the risks his volunteers faced. ""Many sustained serious injuries. One of our key members, Sonu Singh Chheena, was nearly gored when a bull charged at him.""The lack of tranquilisation tools or blowguns made the task too dangerous to continue. Efforts to acquire tranquilisation tools have met resistance from the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), which opposes the use of dart guns on cattle. Conservationist Dr Amitabh Agnihotri, however, questioned this stance. ""If dart guns can be used to tranquillise tigers and elephants under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, why the uproar over their use on stray bulls? This is about saving human and animal lives,"" he argued.What nobody contests is that UP's stray cattle crisis has turned its highways into dangerous zones. The 2019 Livestock Census recorded 1.9 crore cattle in the state, including 11.8 lakh strays. Today, that number has grown to an estimated 15 lakh, with 12 lakh reportedly housed in shelters. But it's a claim many refuse to believe.""Reflective tapes are a good first step,"" Singh said. ""But they are not a solution to the underlying problem.""The urgency of the tape initiative is reflected by UP's grim road safety statistics. In 2022, the state recorded 41,746 accidents, leading to 22,595 fatalities - the highest in the country - and 28,541 injuries, a 6.4% rise in deaths and a 14.6% increase in injuries compared to 2021. It's not known what percentage of the accidents can be attributed to collisions with stray cattle. Despite its challenges, the reflective tape initiative marks a significant step forward.A private company working with the state has demonstrated reflective tapes in three sizes, ensuring they fit animals of varying proportions. The project has also opened the door to broader collaboration between the Animal Husbandry Department and the Transport Department, which are mapping accident-prone areas for further intervention.Additional transport commissioner Pushpsen Satyarthi said, ""This is about making roads safer for both humans and animals, preventing unnecessary collisions, and saving lives."" For now, the reflective tapes glint in the headlights of passing vehicles-a flicker of hope against the vast darkness of UP's roads. Whether this light can spark systemic change remains an open question.","UP launched a deceptively simple solution. It taped fluorescent reflective strips around the necks and horns of stray cattle.

Indian foreign exchange strengthens again after a multi week low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-foreign-exchange-strengthens-again-after-a-multi-week-low/articleshow/116095743.cms,"NEW DELHI: India’s forex has started to rally once again after a consecutive plunge for eight months, hitting a multi month low.Data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this week revealed that India's foreign exchange reserves rose by $1.510 billion to $658.091 billion for the week ending November 29.However, since hitting an all-time high of $704.89 billion in September, the reserves have been consistently declining.This dip in the forex exchange is attributed to the cenbank’s efforts to prevent a sharp fall in the Rupee's value. A substantial foreign exchange reserve buffer helps shield domestic economic activity from global shocks.Recent apex bank data showed that India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, stood at $568.852 billion while gold reserves stood at $ 66.979 billion.Estimates indicate that India's foreign exchange reserves are adequate to cover roughly one year of anticipated imports.In 2023, India added around $58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves, combating the cumulative decline of $71 billion in 2022.Foreign exchange reserves, or FX reserves, are assets maintained by a country's central bank or monetary authority, predominantly in reserve currencies like the US Dollar, alongside smaller holdings in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.The RBI closely monitors foreign exchange markets, intervening only to maintain orderly market conditions and curb excessive volatility in the Rupee exchange rate, without adhering to any fixed target level or range.The RBI often intervenes to manage liquidity, including selling dollars, to curb sharp rupee depreciation. It has strategically purchased dollars during periods of rupee strength and sold them when the currency weakens, enhancing the appeal of Indian assets to investors.The rupee has emerged as one of the most stable currencies in Asia over the past decade, transitioning from its earlier phase of volatility.","India's foreign exchange reserves rose by $1.510 billion to $658.091 billion for the week ending November 29.

Juvenile crime surge in Andhra Pradesh: Deep dive into the alarming trends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/juvenile-crime-surge-in-andhra-pradesh-deep-dive-into-the-alarming-trends/articleshow/116094825.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The gruesome case of an eight-year-old girl who was kidnapped, raped, and murdered by three minor boys under Muchhumarri police station limits in Pagidyala mandal, Nandyal district, is not an isolated crime committed by juveniles. The police estimate that 80 to 90 minors are apprehended in Andhra Pradesh every month for various crimes.Recently, a 45-year-old teacher, Ezhas Ahmed, at the ZP High School in Kothapalle village of Rayachoti mandal in Annamayya district, was reportedly beaten to death by three students in the classroom.The teacher was prompting the students to maintain calm in the classroom, and in the process, he reportedly chided a batch of students. Reacting to this, three students pounced on the teacher, striking him in the chest, leading to his death.Though the number of cases in which juveniles were named as accused has decreased by over 5.5 percent in the past five years (2018 to 2022) in Andhra Pradesh, as per the NCRB report, juveniles' involvement in crimes has been a matter of concern.The involvement of juveniles in crimes ranging from minor offences to heinous crimes has been reported in parts of the state. Between 2018 and 2022, a total of 4,391 cases, including 4,073 cases under BNS, were committed by juveniles in Andhra Pradesh.As per the Juvenile Justice Act (JJA), a juvenile is defined as a person under 18 years of age. However, juveniles aged 16-18 who commit heinous crimes, as defined by the JJA and BNS, may be tried as adults. This is contingent upon a prior assessment of their mental and physical condition by theJuvenile Justice Board (JJB).Speaking to TOI, Superintendent of Observation Home for Juveniles (Boys), Visakhapatnam, K Veerayya, said the juveniles' involvement was seen in all sorts of criminal activities, including murder, kidnap, sexual offences, and property offences. The educational background of juveniles in the Vizag region is primary to matric and matric higher secondary, he added.A senior police officer said 50 percent of juveniles apprehended for committing crimes studied up to primary levels, and around 90 percent of them resided with parents in the state. The juveniles have been involved in the transportation of ganja, kidnaps, and murders, he added.As many as 5,445 juveniles were apprehended between 2018 and 2022 in the state. 116 juveniles were awarded punishment during the period. There are many reasons behind the increasing involvement in crimes, such as financial issues, broken families, the lure of easy money, and attraction towards a lavish lifestyle, the police added.A senior police officer, A Narasimha Murthy, said they observed that a lack of parental control is one of the major reasons for the increasing involvement of juveniles in offences. He appealed to the parents to keep a watch on their children to ensure they don’t develop an addiction.","The police estimate that 80 to 90 minors are apprehended in Andhra Pradesh every month for various crimes.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
