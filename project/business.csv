NEW DELHI: Taking note of the days-long ordeal faced by passengers due to mass cancellation of IndiGo flights, the parliamentary panel on transport, tourism and civil aviation will soon summon all airlines and other stakeholders, including sector regulator DGCA and officials from aviation ministry. The panel, headed by Sanjay Kumar Jha of JDU, will not only seek explanations but also explore solutions to ensure that such disruptions do not occur again, sources said.TOI learnt that while some panel members themselves faced inconvenience due to sudden flight cancellations, others received calls detailing how the crisis derailed travel plans of thousands of passengers.“This is an unprecedented situation in the history of India’s aviation sector. Both the airlines and the regulator will have to explain why such a situation occurred and why they failed to anticipate it,” said a member of the panel.Another member said the episode has exposed deeper systemic issues of the aviation sector, including manpower shortages, strained crew-management systems and gaps in regulatory oversight. The panel will also discuss how rival airlines ‘increased fares abnormally to make undue profit’.","The parliamentary panel on transport, tourism and civil aviation will soon summon all airlines and other stakeholders.

Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

AGARTALA: The unprecedented flight disruptions across India have extended a family’s wait to give the final farewell to their young son, prolonging their agony. The body of 23-year-old Saptarshi Das from Ramnagar in Agartala has been holed up at a mortuary in Delhi for past three days.Saptarshi, a medical intern at a private hospital in Lucknow, died in a road accident on Delhi-Lucknow national highway on the night of Dec 3. His friends Arnav Chakraborty, Ayush Sharma and Shrestha Pancholi also lost their lives in the accident. Their car overturned after colliding at a high speed with a stationary truck.Following an autopsy, Saptarshi’s body was released to his family for transportation to Agartala for the last rites. However, the sudden cancellation of flights by IndiGo led to a frustrating cycle of returning the body to the mortuary and booking hotel accommodations, while scouting for alternative options.Saptarshi’s mother Arpita Debsarkar said her family was repeatedly promised about flights, only to discover they had been cancelled at the last moment, and had to navigate back and forth between the mortuary, hotel & airport. Saptarshi was nearing the completion of his MBBS internship at Venkateshwar Medical University, with just three months left, his mother said.Chaos still persists at Agartala’s Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport as a result of the flight disruptions. In past two days alone, three flights per day have been cancelled, leaving hundreds of passengers, including patients, stranded at the airport lounge. Frustrated travellers have accused both IndiGo and Airports Authority of India of failing to fulfil their obligations.","The body of 23-year-old Saptarshi Das from Ramnagar in Agartala has been holed up at a mortuary in Delhi for past three days.

Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

MUMBAI: An Embraer E175LR private jet was rushed to Guwahati on Saturday to bring back 36 children of top corporate executives after they were stranded in Kaziranga when IndiGo cancelled its flights. The scramble has become emblematic of the sudden rush for charter aircraft in India as disruptions at the country’s largest airline ripple through the peak travel and wedding season.“Typical movements included Delhi-Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, all popular wedding destinations, apart from Hyderabad and Chennai,” said Gautam Sahni of Noida-based Subha Aviation, which specialises in airline charters. He described the spike as “unprecedented”, driven entirely by destination wedding groups and smaller groups of 50-180 whose scheduled flights were cancelled at short notice: “Look for 50-seater airline jets and you will find that nothing is available in the market today because, ultimately, you have to take aircraft away from a scheduled carrier’s flow. ”“Every airline does charters, but none can support this kind of sudden demand, especially at a time their scheduled flights are flying packed because of IndiGo disruptions,” he said.In one instance, he added, an eight-seater aircraft had to be flown empty from Delhi to Kolkata to pick up a wedding party after their airline connection broke down.Mandar Bharde, of Mumbai-based MAB Aviation, said past four days had brought a flood of enquiries, led largely by destination weddings and year-end travel.“Every day we are getting requests from destination wedding hosts in Jaipur and Udaipur. Dec is peak vacation season and all charter flights are full,” he said. Bharde added that Mumbai has about 8-10 charter aircraft while Delhi has about 20, but most operators were already busy before the airline disruptions worsened the crunch.Rahul Muchhal, of Accretion Aviation, said: “We’ve been getting 200-250 calls daily over the past three days, not much from Mumbai, and mostly for Delhi-Goa, Delhi-Udaipur and Mumbai-Delhi. But today, nothing is available. The actual bookings were mainly from corporate houses who needed to shift people urgently.”So, how much do these charters cost? A 30-seater Delhi-Udaipur charter was quoted at about Rs 17.6 lakh plus taxes, touching Rs 20 lakh all-inclusive; the operator did not divulge the aircraft type. Smaller aircraft such as the 7-seater King Air B200 on the Delhi-Vadodara sector cost Rs 11 lakh for a round trip. Aircraft type also dictates the price.A 13-seater Embraer Legacy aircraft cost Rs 20 lakh to charter, including 18% GST, and a 7-seater Bombardier Learjet went for Rs 18-19 lakh.","The scramble has become emblematic of the sudden rush for charter aircraft in India as disruptions at the country’s largest airline ripple through the peak travel and wedding season.

NEW DELHI: An ambitious campaign that began on Sept 13 will reach its grand finale on Dec 8 at a glittering ‘Ideas for India’ summit, where some of the finest minds in the country — ranging across diverse sectors like business, tech, policy, and academia — will assemble to brainstorm innovations that could transform the nation, and 12 winners whose ideas were chosen after a gruelling selection process will be felicitated. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be the chief guest and deliver the keynote address.The Times of India launched the Ideas for India initiative as a powerful thought-leadership platform, recognising that achieving the national vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047 requires not just economic momentum, but a fundamental reimagining of solutions. The campaign was conceived with the core belief that answers to India’s greatest challenges lie within its people.The initiative has tapped the country’s innovative energy, drawing thousands of registrations from students, entrepreneurs and change-makers across India. At its heart is a nationwide Innovation Challenge that moves beyond speeches and slogans to focus on actionable blueprints.Participants were invited to submit solutions across three critical pillars – Make in India for the World, Environmental Sustainability, and Health & Social Wellbeing – with a focus on scalability, feasibility and impact.The promise is clear: your idea today can contribute to India’s progress tomorrow, provided it can be executed on the ground and deliver measurable change.Entries were expected to address real-world gaps, from inclusive industrial growth and skilling to clean energy, water security, mental health, digital inclusion and social equity.The Innovation Challenge cast its net wide across emerging and priority sectors such as green and renewable energy, healthcare and health tech, advanced manufacturing, cyber security and digital public infrastructure, agri-tech, urban mobility, water and climate resilience, waste management and circular economy, logistics, and education and skilling.To ensure rigour and transparency, the process was structured as an end-to-end framework. After a national call for entries through a dedicated microsite, TechGig conducted the first-level screening, with EY validating the scoring and shortlisting. A 28-member screening jury of entrepreneurs, CXOs, marketing and tech leaders then helped narrow the list down to 67 submissions, from which 34 finalists emerged.Shortlisted participants were tasked with building first-cut prototypes and received one-on-one mentorship from a panel of five experts in early Dec. Their refined solutions were then presented before a Grand Jury of senior industry leaders and policy voices, split across two groups to evaluate categories such as Economic Resilience, Environment & Sustainability, and Health & Social across tech and non-tech streams.The journey now culminates in a National Summit, where around 30 of the most promising innovators will present their ideas and prototypes to policymakers, experts and industry leaders, and 12 winners will finally be chosen. A dedicated compendium will capture the 30 blueprints that made it to the finals — ideas that not only stood up to rigorous evaluation, but can also serve as potential building blocks for the Viksit Bharat that India envisions in 2047.",The Times of India launched the Ideas for India initiative as a powerful thought-leadership platform.

NEW DELHI: A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). While there has been a slight improvement compared to recent weeks, many parts of the city remained shrouded in dense haze.Areas including Ghazipur Mandi, Anand Vihar, and Wazirpur experienced severely reduced visibility due to the smog. CPCB data showed Anand Vihar recording an AQI of 366, Sonia Vihar 352, Wazirpur 359, and Ghazipur Mandi 366, all in the ‘very poor’ range. Bawana recorded the highest AQI at 375 at 7 am, while NSIT Dwarka measured 260, categorised as ‘poor’.The India Gate and Kartavya Path areas were also covered in smog, with the AQI in the region at 311, falling under the ‘very poor’ category.According to the AQI scale, 0–50 is ‘good’, 51–100 ‘satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘moderate’, 201–300 ‘poor’, 301–400 ‘very poor’, and 401–500 ‘severe’.In response to the worsening air quality, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued a statement on Friday following a question raised by MP Dr.Laxmikant Bajpayee in the Rajya Sabha. He had asked whether it was true that “one in every seven deaths in Delhi can be attributed to the city’s toxic air as claimed by several studies and reported in the media.”Minister of State Kirti Vardhan Singh replied that various studies have been conducted by academic and research institutes on the impact of air pollution. He added that in 2025, the AQI in Delhi had not reached the ‘severe plus’ level on any day.The government continues to take measures to tackle pollution in Delhi-NCR. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), established under the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Act, 2021, oversees air quality in Delhi and neighbouring regions.The Commission has been working collaboratively with all major stakeholders to reduce pollution. It has issued 95 statutory directions to guide action against air pollution and has prepared a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to manage pollution during peak winter months. Stricter emission norms for polluting activities in the NCR have also been implemented, and regular review meetings are held to monitor progress.","A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am.

Cabbies double fares; pvt bus operators come to rescue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabbies-double-fares-pvt-bus-operators-come-to-rescue/articleshow/125798323.cms,"Chandigarh/Nagpur: With major flight disruptions continuing for the third consecutive day, taxi operators in Chandigarh are driving away with the moolah. All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues', prompting many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - to book last-minute taxis. Several passengers told TOI that they had to fork out nearly twice the normal fare of Rs 5,000-6,000.Those who had time switched to trains, but most had to cough up extra for a cab ride. Arun Kumar and Naina, who were headed to Canada, said they had no option but to book a cab after their flight to Delhi was cancelled. ""We paid Rs 10,000 for a taxi to IGI. Just last week, our friends went for Rs 5,500,"" they said.In Nagpur, abrupt disruptions & repeated cancellations forced hundreds of passengers to turn to private sleeper bus operators, who stepped in to travel to major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru at short notice. Unlike Chandigarh, however, operators did not hike charges despite the sudden influx, said private bus operator Mukesh Chaurasiya, who runs a fleet of sleeper coaches. ""We charged normal fares. People were genuinely relieved because they had no other option left,"" he said.""Yesterday alone, I provided four to five buses from Nagpur to Mumbai after flights got cancelled. My buses even had to go directly to the airport because so many passengers were stranded, especially after the Bengaluru flight was cancelled,"" Chaurasiya told TOI.""Even today, five to seven buses are coming from Mumbai to Nagpur. We're getting inquiries from Delhi and other cities as well, but our capacity is limited,"" he added.Other private bus operators, too, confirmed a spike in emergency bookings. When TOI checked online fares for Saturday's buses from Nagpur to Mumbai, the AC sleeper seats were less than Rs 3,000.

Right to Disconnect Bill 2025: Supriya Sule moves legislation to promote work-life balance for employees after office hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supriya-sule-moves-bill-to-ensure-right-to-disconnect-after-office-hours/articleshow/125803345.cms,"Supriya Sule (ANI image)

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill in the Lower House to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.The Bill, ""The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025"", seeks to impose sanctions at a rate of 1 per cent of the total remuneration of its employees on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.The Bill, as introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday, provides every employee the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications.""It aims to foster a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing the ""burnout caused by today's digital culture,"" she wrote on X.While digital and communication technology offer benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries a significant risk of eroding the boundaries between professional and personal life, she argued in the private member's Bill.""Studies have found that if an employee is expected to be available round the clock, they tend to exhibit risks of over-work like sleep deprivation, developing stress and being emotionally exhausted. This persistent urge to respond to calls and emails (termed as 'telepressure'), constant checking of emails throughout the day, and even on weekends and holidays, is reported to have destroyed the work-life balance of employees,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill read.""According to a study, the constant monitoring of work related messages and emails, may overtax employees' brains leading to a condition called 'info-obesity'.""The Bill argued that there is a need to respect the personal space of the employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employer's calls, emails etc., during out-of-work hours.""The need is also to recognise the rights of the employees, it also takes into consideration the competitive needs of the companies and their diverse work cultures. Flexibility in the right to disconnect rules and leaves it to the individual companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees is need of the hour,"" the Bill further read.The digital transformation has direct impact on conditions in the employment contract, like the time and the place of work.Hence if an employee agrees to works during out-of-work hours, overtime pay at the same rate as his wage rate is also necessary to check the surge in unpaid overtime work, brought about by digital transformation, she argued in the Bill.The Bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use.To free an employee from digital distractions and enable him to truly connect with the people around him, the Bill provides for digital detox centres.""The Bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect. The Bill seeks to recognise right to disconnect as a way to reduce stress and ease tension between an employees' personal and professional life,"" the Bill concluded.She introduced all together what she termed forward-looking Private Member Bills in the Parliament - the other two were The Paternity and Paternal Benefits Bill, 2025. It introduces paid paternal leave to ensure fathers have the legal right to take part in their child's early development. It breaks the traditional model, supports the new mother's well-being, and promotes flexible parenting.The other one is the Code on Social Security (Amendment) Bill, 2025, that recognises platform-based gig workers as a distinct category, ensuring minimum wages, regulated hours, social security, fair conditions, and equitable contracts to ensure a fairer, more sustainable environment and economy for them.Several other members of the Lok Sabha also introduced their Private Member Bills in the House.","Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo’s flight chaos deepened on Saturday, with the airline scrapping more than 400 flights across four major airports, even after it secured temporary relief from the new court-ordered pilot duty and rest rules just a day earlier, PTI news agency quoted sources.Of these cancellations, Bengaluru airport accounted for 124 flights—63 departures and 61 arrivals—while Mumbai saw 109 cancellations, including 51 departures and 58 arrivals. Delhi airport reported 106 cancellations, with 54 departures and 52 arrivals affected. In Hyderabad, IndiGo cancelled 66 flights, the PTI sources added.The disruptions, which began earlier this week, have continued due to pilot-rostering problems, leading to widespread cancellations across the country.The ministry issued statement, ""Ministry of civil aviation has taken serious note of concerns regarding unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption. In order to protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing, the Ministry has invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes.An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to the fare caps that have now been prescribed.These caps will remain in force until the situation fully stabilises. The objective of this directive is to maintain pricing discipline in the market, prevent any exploitation of passengers in distress, and ensure that citizens who urgently need to travel — including senior citizens, students, and patients — are not subjected to financial hardship during this period. ""More than 200 flights were cancelled on Saturday from just two major cities—Delhi and Mumbai—a day after airlines received temporary relaxations in the second phase of the court-mandated flight duty and rest rules for pilots, sources said.According to officials, Mumbai saw 109 IndiGo cancellations, including 51 arrivals and 58 departures. At Delhi airport, 106 IndiGo flights were cancelled, with 54 departures and 52 arrivals affected.Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu on Friday said that the government will not ignore the massive disruptions faced by IndiGo airlines, stressing that ""this thing shouldn't be left unattended"".He said a committee has been formed to investigate the issue and necessary action will be taken against those responsible.Speaking about the situation, the minister said, ""The immediate priority for us is to bring back normalcy and provide all the support to the passengers.""He also added that the ministry is closely monitoring all operational aspects. ""We are deeply observing this, and observing the FDTL norms, scheduling network. We will thoroughly look into this and ensure that all airlines follow due diligence.""The minister further confirmed that a formal probe has been launched.

In Ahmedabad, seven arrivals and 12 departures were cancelled.At Mumbai airport, passengers remained stranded as IndiGo struggled to stabilise operations. Long queues were also seen at Chennai airport, where several flights were cancelled.14 arrivals and 28 departures of IndiGo cancelled at Pune Airport on Saturday.IndiGo, which usually handles about two-thirds of India’s domestic air traffic and operates around 2,300 flights daily, cancelled more than 1,000 flights on Friday alone as crew shortages continued.Aviation regulator DGCA issued new orders on Friday to help stabilise the situation. The authority granted exemptions in Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) and other relaxations so IndiGo can deploy more pilots and reduce delays.The DGCA said the exemptions were aimed at restoring normal operations “at the earliest.”The airline apologised on X, saying it would automatically process refunds and provide full waivers for cancellations or rescheduling for travel between December 5 and December 15, 2025.The airline added, ""Kindly check the flight status on our website and the notifications sent to you.

"IVF pushes 9 in 10 couples into catastrophic debt; study recommends PM-JAY cover Rs 81,332 per cycle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ivf-pushes-9-in-10-couples-into-catastrophic-debt-study-recommends-pm-jay-cover-rs-81332-per-cycle/articleshow/125807314.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Infertility treatment in India is driving an overwhelming financial crisis for families, with a new multi-centre study showing that nearly 90% of couples undergoing IVF are pushed into catastrophic expenditure—even in public hospitals. The analysis, conducted across five major institutions, highlights the scale of the burden at a time when infertility affects an estimated 3.9–16.8% of Indian couples.The study found that out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for one IVF cycle averages Rs 1.1 lakh in public hospitals and Rs 2.30 lakh in private hospitals, forcing more than half of couples to borrow money. Only 5% had any insurance coverage for IVF, and those who did received limited support. Researchers also estimated the health-system cost of one IVF cycle at Rs 81,332, irrespective of hospital efficiency.Based on this, the study recommends that Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) consider adopting Rs 81,332 as the reimbursement package rate if IVF is added to the scheme.The study was conducted by the HTA Resource Hub at the Indian Council of Medical Research–National Institute for Research in Reproductive and Child Health (ICMR-NIRRCH), led by Principal Investigator Dr Beena Joshi.The financial strain extends beyond IVF. Among couples undergoing infertility treatment for conditions such as PCOS, endometriosis, tubal disease or male-factor infertility, 25% experienced catastrophic expenditure. The median OOPE for non-IVF infertility treatment was Rs 11,317, with private hospitals leading to higher medical costs, while public facilities imposed higher indirect and non-medical expenses.Quality of life was markedly poorer among couples seeking treatment, especially those undergoing IVF. Women reported significant pain, anxiety and depression, while men showed increased anxiety scores.The study was conducted across PGIMER Chandigarh, SRIHER Chennai, Maulana Azad Medical College (Delhi), SAT Hospital at Government Medical College Trivandrum, and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Wardha. It assessed 30 IVF patients and 100 infertility patients at each site, along with detailed costing from hospital records.Among IVF couples, oligospermia and tubal-factor infertility were the leading causes, while among non-IVF groups, PCOS was the most common diagnosis.The researchers note that because most infertility expenses fall under OPD care, PM-JAY would need to revise its current structure—which excludes OPD costs—to make IVF coverage meaningful. They also suggest that, in line with earlier CGHS norms and NICE guidelines, up to three IVF cycles could be considered for reimbursement.","Infertility affects an estimated 3.9–16.8% of Indian couples. Out-of-pocket expenditure for one IVF cycle averages Rs 1.1 lakh in public hospitals and Rs 2.30 lakh in private hospitals. Only 5% had any insurance coverage for IVF, and those who did received limited support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125807359,imgsize-107001,width-400,resizemode-4/couple-faces-financial-strain.jpg"

PM Modi Bats For Peaceful Resolution To Ukraine Conflict

'Like Pole Star': PM Modi Lauds Strong Ties With Russia; Hails Moscow's Support In War On Terror

Relationship built on trust has stood test of time: PM

NEW DELHI: Amidst the turbulence the world has witnessed in the past 8 decades, the India-Russia relationship has remained like the pole or a guiding star resting on mutual respect and trust, said PM Narendra Modi as both sides reaffirmed their commitment to upgrading the economic partnership in the summit with President Vladimir Putin.The 2 countries signed over a dozen agreements and MoUs, including in areas like health, migration and maritime cooperation, and adopted a framework for economic cooperation that is expected to boost trade to $ 100 billion in the next 5 years, as Putin said that Russia is ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast-growing Indian economy.Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything that is required for the development of India's energy, said Putin while hailing India’s “independent and self-sufficient"" foreign policy. The Indian side maintained its energy partners, whether old or new, understood the need for diversification given its focus on securing its energy interests and the need to maintain stability in oil prices.While there was a “general discussion” on defence including the Make-in-India initiative and legacy cooperation, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the focus in the summit was mainly on economic cooperation and efforts to ensure balanced and sustainable trade by facilitating more Indian exports to Russia.Both leaders also strongly backed ongoing efforts for early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. Modi underlined the significance of civil nuclear cooperation, saying energy security has been a strong and vital pillar of the India-Russia partnership.“Over the past eight decades, the world has witnessed many ups and downs. Humanity has faced numerous challenges and crises. Yet, through all of this, the India-Russia friendship has remained steady like a guiding star. Built on mutual respect and deep trust, our relationship has stood the test of time,” said Modi, adding that the new economic cooperation programme till 2030 will make trade and investment more diversified and balanced. He said cooperation in critical minerals is vital for ensuring secure and diversified supply chains across the world.India announced a free 30-day e-Tourist Visa and a 30-day Group Tourist Visa for Russian citizens. The manpower mobility agreement will create new strength and new opportunities for both countries, said Modi, who also raised the need for early release of Indians serving in the Russian army with Putin.According to a joint statement - as both sides called for comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council to reflect contemporary global realities and to make it more representative, effective and efficient in dealing with issues of international peace and security - Russia reiterated its steadfast support for India’s permanent membership in a reformed Council.Putin also said that Russia and India are conducting independent foreign policy together with the like-minded countries in BRICS and SCO and promoting a more “just and democratic multipolar world order”.“We are defending the main principles of the international law enshrined in the UN Charter. Among them, the right of any country for its own way of development and the preservation of their cultural civilizational identity, respect for sovereignty, careful balance of interests of all participants of the world community,” said Putin.On defence cooperation, the joint statement said that responding to India’s quest for self-reliance, the partnership is reorienting presently to joint research and development, co-development and co-production of advanced defence technology and systems. “Our country for the last half a century has been helping to arm and modernize the Indian army, including the air defense forces, aviation, and the navy. In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiations we just had,” said Putin in his media statement after the meeting.On international issues, the leaders endorsed their cooperation in keeping Afghanistan free of terrorism and stressed the importance of resolving the Iran nuclear issue through dialogue. They also expressed concern, according to the joint statement, over the humanitarian situation in Gaza and strongly stressed the importance for all parties concerned to remain committed to agreements and understandings reached between them for cessation of conflict, humanitarian assistance and a sustainable peace.","India-Russia relationship has remained like the pole or a guiding star resting on mutual respect and trust, said PM Narendra Modi.

Exemptions will put safety at risk, says pilots’ body

NEW DELHI: Govt has put on hold the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms for pilots with “immediate effect for now” and expects normalcy in IndiGo operations to be restored by Dec 15.The aviation ministry’s decision came Friday when over 1,000 IndiGo flights — more than half its schedule — were cancelled, with none operating from Delhi, wreaking havoc on plans of lakhs of fliers. IndiGo is offering full waiver on cancellation /reschedule requests on travel from Dec 5 to 15. On Saturday, less than 1,000 flights are likely to be cancelled. The number will gradually fall.On Thursday — when its on-time performance touched its nadir at 8.5% — IndiGo had sought exemption from certain norms, such as the cap on number of night landings a pilot can make between midnight and 6am, to restore normalcy in Airbus A320 operations by Feb 10, 2026. Since that was a long way off, govt put Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s FDTL orders in abeyance.The week-long flight operation disruptions in IndiGo has wiped out nearly Rs 20,000 crore worth of market value for Interglobe Aviations, the company that runs the airline. In past one week, the stock has fallen nearly 9% to Rs 5,371 on BSE at Friday’s close with the airlines major’s current market cap at nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore now.From its Nov 28 close at Rs 5,904 on BSE, the stock had fallen to an intra-day low of Rs 5,266 during Friday’s session. However, after DGCA allowed the airlines some temporary leeway with crew management rules, the stock recovered some ground to close at Rs 5,371, market players said.While IndiGo’s stock suffered due to the ongoing crisis, the stock price of SpiceJet, one of its smaller competitors, gained. Friday SpiceJet stock price rallied 2.5% on BSE to close at Rs 31.Putting on hold Friday its orders meant to ensure that pilots are not fatigued, thereby boosting flight safety, govt said the move will not compromise on safety of passengers. “This decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs... taken urgent measures to address the ongoing disruption in flight schedules, particularly those of IndiGo,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said.DGCA has constituted a four-member committee headed by a joint DG for a “comprehensive review and assessment of circumstances leading to operational disruption of IndiGo. Committee will identify accountabilities for failure and adequacy of subsequent mitigation measures being taken by IndiGo,” a govt statement said.Aviation authorities say all possible steps are being taken to stabilise IndiGo operations at the earliest. DGCA has offered its Airbus A320-type-rated flight operations inspectors (FOIs) to operate flights for IndiGo in an attempt to help the airline recover from its lowest operational point in over 19 years of existence. “FOIs operate a flight every month (to keep their licences valid). We have made this offer to IndiGo, they did not ask for it, to help it get back on its feet as quickly as possible,” said sources.A significant number of pilots for IndiGo and for some other Indian carriers are upset at losing their hard-earned right to a more humane roster. “Airlines treat us as mere cost-cutting items in their income and expenditure statements during their good days. When it fell on bad days last month, we helped as much as working at 120%. But that could not have gone on indefinitely as we remember how they treat us,” said many senior pilots.Sensing the simmering discontent, Naidu held meetings over video links with some pilot bodies and assured them that the exemption from the new FDTL was temporary. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai issued an appeal to pilots’ associations as the aviation sector is under “significant stress”.“As we now approach fog season, peak holiday period, and marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges. Passenger volumes are expected to rise sharply, and weather-related impacts may further complicate scheduling and flight safety. Given this situation, we earnestly request full cooperation of all pilot bodies, associations, and pilots across India,” Ahmed’s letter says.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers issued a video statement saying normalcy could return between Dec 10 and 15, while admitting the crisis had “shaken customers’ belief in IndiGo’s reliability, built over the last 19 years”.Hours after govt relaxed key provisions of the new duty-and-rest norms to help IndiGo stabilise its pilot roster and flight operations, the Indian pilot community criticised the civil aviation regulator, demanding that the said dispensations be withdrawn immediately.The relaxations now allow IndiGo to roster its pilots for longer duty hours than permitted under Phase II of revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, which came into effect on Nov 1 after a preparatory period of about two years. FDTL norms are mandatory regulatory limits that define the maximum duty hours and minimum rest periods that should be factored in when rostering pilots for duty so as to keep crew fatigue under check and maintain operational safety. Each country formulates its own FDTL based on specific operational realities and scientific studies.In a strongly worded letter to DGCA, Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said selective exemptions compromise safety and undermine the intent of the rules. The union also sought a probe into what it termed an “artificial pilot-shortage narrative” created by IndiGo, punitive action against the airline’s accountable management, and full enforcement of Phase II of the FDTL without exemptions. Airlines in India adopted Phase II of FDTL on Nov 1.The dispensations have destroyed regulatory parity, undermined public trust in DGCA’s neutrality, compromised scientifically established fatigue protections, and placed millions of passengers at heightened risk, said ALPA. Aviation safety expert Capt Amit Singh said the changes bypass the established procedure for exemptions. “These are ad hoc changes. There was no pilot representation before these changes were made,” he said, adding that exemptions must follow safety risk assessments in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation norms.Meanwhile, ALPA’s strongest objection pertained to changes in night operations; relaxation of the definition of night (midnight to 5am was extended in the new FDTL to midnight to 6am) and doubling of permitted landings “encroaching night” — the return to the 5am definition means that a pilot rostered for, say, 5.30am, will not be considered as flying night operations — from two to four, contradicting the revised FDTL and “fundamentally diluting” fatigue protections.DGCA has effectively acknowledged that IndiGo pilots will now fly with reduced rest and increased fatigue, placing passengers at higher risk, it said. It referred to a Nov 24 meeting ALPA had with DGCA in which it was “unequivocally agreed” that no dispensation, exemption or variation, especially for commercial reasons, would be granted to any operator. “FDTL norms exist solely to safeguard human life, and any dilution would expose pilots, passengers, and aircraft to unacceptable risks,” it said.The association questioned why widespread disruptions surfaced 35 days after Phase II came into force: IndiGo had nearly two years to prepare for the Nov 1 implementation of Phase II of revised duty and rest rules for pilot rostering. “These events raise serious concerns that an artificial crisis was engineered to exert pressure on govt for commercial gain under the pretext of public inconvenience.”ALPA warned that if the dispensations are not revoked, DGCA, and not pilots, must bear responsibility for any fatigue-related incident arising from the relaxations.","The aviation ministry’s decision came Friday when over 1,000 IndiGo flights — more than half its schedule — were cancelled, with none operating from Delhi.

Hasina’s stay in India is her personal decision: Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hasinas-stay-in-india-is-her-personal-decision-jaishankar/articleshow/125812094.cms,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials

Unreasonable for nations to expect say in our foreign ties: EAM

NEW DELHI: Amid calls by Bangladesh for ex-PM Sheikh Hasina ’s extradition, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said Saturday her stay in India is her personal decision influenced by what transpired in the country last year.India has so far not acceded to Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of Hasina, who was sentenced to death last month for crimes against humanity.Asked if she could stay as long as she wanted, the minister said this was a different question. “She came here in a certain circumstance, and I think that circumstance clearly is a factor in what happens to her. But again, that is something in which she has to make up her mind,” he said. He also said India is a well-wisher of Bangladesh.“As a democratic country... we would like to see the will of the people ascertained. I’m quite confident that whatever comes out... would have a balanced and mature view about the relationship and, hopefully things would improve,” he said at Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.On the visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin , he said the India-Russia partnership has been among the “steadiest big relationships” in the last 70-80 years.Foreign minister Jaishankar disagreed that Putin’s visit could complicate India’s negotiations with the US on a bilateral trade agreement.“I think everybody knows that India has relations with all the major countries in the world,” Jaishankar said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. “I think for any country to expect to have a veto or a say in how we develop our relations with others is not a reasonable proposition,” he said.Jaishankar was asked if Putin’s two-day visit to New Delhi that focused largely on significantly enhancing the economic dimension of India-Russia ties will have a bearing on the negotiations with the US for the proposed trade deal. “Because remember, the others can expect the same. I think we’ve always made it very clear that we have multiple relationships. We have a freedom of choice,” he said. “We talk about what is called strategic autonomy and that continues and I cannot imagine why anybody would have reason to expect the contrary,” he added.The minister acknowledged that the focus of the Trump administration has been on trade and noted that India’s approach in navigating it is totally driven by national interests. “I think clearly right now trade is the most important issue there. We have, it’s clearly very central to the thinking in Washington, much more than it was to earlier administrations, which is something which we have recognised and we are prepared to meet,” he said.“But we are prepared to meet it on reasonable terms. I mean, for those of you who think that diplomacy is about pleasing somebody else I’m sorry, that’s not my view of diplomacy. I mean, to me, it is about defending our national interests,” he said.The India-US relations are going through possibly the worst phase in the last two decades after Washington imposed a whopping 50% on Indian goods, including 25% levies for New Delhi’s procurement of Russian crude. The two sides are currently holding negotiations for the proposed a trade deal “We believe that there can be a landing point for our respective trade interests. Obviously, that is something which will be negotiated hard because it has an implication for livelihoods in this country,” he said.“At the end of the day, for us the interests of the workers and the farmers and the small business and the middle class matters. When we look at a trade agreement with a country like the US, you have to be extremely judicious about your position, about what you put on the table,” he said.On President Putin’s trip to India, Jaishankar said for a “big” and “rising” country like India, it is important to maintain good cooperation with as many important players as possible in the world in line with freedom of choice.","India has so far not acceded to Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of Hasina, who was sentenced to death last month for crimes against humanity. “She came here in a certain circumstance, and I think that circumstance clearly is a factor in what happens to her.

Cap on fares comes too late for lakhs

NEW DELHI: Govt on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees and taxes extra). In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha gave IndiGo two days — instead of the 21 sought by the airline — to fully restore operations.Sinha summoned the airline brass led by CEO Pieter Elbers to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan after the ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, arming itself with powers instead of leaving it to aviation regulator DGCA. The carrier, controlling 60% of the domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on Dec 7, and return bags within two days. The airline has been barred from charging any rescheduling fee, which it was levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.Unlike other airlines which were updating DGCA periodically about flight duty time limitations (FDTL), IndiGo not only failed to implement it but even refused to disclose details to the regulator. Officials pointed out that the airline did not update authorities and travellers adequately during the chaos caused by its failure to adhere to FTDL despite being given two years to accept the globally accepted protocol.IndiGo has been instructed to improve its communication: it will now submit a report every fortnight on implementation of its commitment to recruit enough pilots to ensure compliance with resting norms.Separately, officials indicated the probe into IndiGo’s operational collapse may be expedited to find out why such a massive failure took place, and based on that the airline may be penalised. The role of the management is under the scanner as well. The airfare caps stay till IndiGo operations stabilise.Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi-Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500; for 500-1,000km (Delhi-Udaipur, Hyderabad-Chennai) at Rs 12,000; 1,000-1,500km (Delhi-Mumbai) at Rs 15,000 and above 1,500km (Delhi-Chennai/Bengaluru/Hyderabad) at Rs 18,000. India had last imposed fare caps during Covid (May 2020 to Aug 2022).Aviation ministry said it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.A reduction in flight cancellation may have begun on Saturday when that number dropped to about 700 — from over 1,000 a day earlier. “We are on our way to operate over 1,500 flights by end of day (Saturday). With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations. We are committed to build back the trust of our customers,” IndiGo said in a statement. IndiGo used to operate over 2,200 flights daily.The fare-capping development may have come way too late for lakhs of passengers who had IndiGo tickets for travel from earlier this week when the airline started cancelling hundreds of flights, till mid-Dec when IndiGo expects to normalise operations. These passengers had to cancel their IndiGo tickets and buy on other airlines like Air India, AI Express, Akasa and SpiceJet at sky-high fares — touching upto Rs 90,000 on certain routes.Geeta Srivastava (name changed on request), for instance, bought tickets for Delhi-Udaipur-Delhi for Rs 11,000. While she travelled Delhi-Udaipur (Dec 5) on some other airline, she was forced to cancel her IndiGo Udaipur-Delhi ticket of Sunday. “I bought Udaipur-Delhi ticket on another airline for Rs 24,000. Of what use is govt directive? Throughout this crisis, aviation ministry has been nothing but a mute spectator,” she fumed.Like Srivastava, lakhs of passengers have had to shell out many times the usual airfare to get to their destinations. The arithmetic is against passengers as IndiGo has almost 65% of the domestic market share. Before the IndiGo crisis, more than five lakh daily domestic flyers were travelling daily this season. Until IndiGo operations are back to normal, almost the vast majority of travellers are chasing seats on airlines that have the remaining 35%. With such a demand-supply mismatch, fares have zoomed.Aviation ministry said in a statement Saturday: “An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to fare caps that have now been prescribed. These caps will remain in force until the situation fully stabilises. Any deviation from the prescribed norms will attract immediate corrective action in public interest.”","Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi- Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500. IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125812083,imgsize-71090,width-400,resizemode-4/govt-caps-flight-fares-gives-indigo-2-days-to-normalise.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The University of Western Australia (UWA) is going to set up two Indian campuses — Chennai and Mumbai — with the university targeting Aug 2026 to start its first academic programme from the Chennai campus.Vice-chancellor Amit Chakma told TOI in an exclusive interaction that the two campuses will function as a single UWA entity in India and award full degrees of the Australian university.According to university officials, the Chennai campus will initially be technology-focused, while the Mumbai campus will be more busine-ss-oriented. Academic offerings will begin at the undergraduate level, with postgr-aduate programmes to be added soon after. “We are wo-rking against some very str-ict timeline to see whether we can start our first programme from Aug 2026,” Chakma said on Wednesday. “The Chennai campus initially would be more technology focused. .. and eventually we’ll build it up. The Mumbai campus probably would be more business centric,” he said. Both campuses will initially function from leased facilities, retrofitted for academic use.While Australia’s Deakin University and University of Wollongong have already started operations, Victoria University, Western Sydney University and La Trobe University have received permissions for the same.“India is a fascinating story unfolding,” said Chakma, adding that UWA sees strong long-term potential for India to emerge as a regional education hub. The entry of multiple international campuses reflects this shift.","The University of Western Australia (UWA) is going to set up two Indian campuses.

Study: Inhaled toxic particles take direct route from lungs to brain

NEW DELHI: Communities living around areas in India that witness mining operations are showing measurable signs of lung impairment and heavy-metal exposure, according to new data tabled in Lok Sabha.The health ministry, citing Indian Council of Medical Research studies, has confirmed that residents in mining belts face risks comparable to those for workers directly involved in extraction.A National Institute of Occupational Health study of 1,202 people living near coal mines found abnormal pulmonary function in 14.3% of miners, 10% of supervisory staff and 7.8% of residents. Chest X-rays showed interstitial lung fibrosis in 2.5% of miners, 2.3% of supervisors and 2.7% of residents. Mercury levels above the permissible exposure limit (<5.8 Mu/dl) were detected in 6.8% of miners and 8% of residents, indicating exposure well beyond workplace boundaries.“These patterns tell us that fine coal dust and silica are travelling far into homes, schools and community spaces,” said Dr Dhiren Gupta, paediatric pulmonologist and allergy specialist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “When non-workers show lung abnormalities comparable to miners, it means even children and families are facing occupational-level exposure without protection.”In Bhilwara district, Rajasthan, children living near the Rampura Agucha mine had higher blood lead levels than control groups, though researchers did not detect toxicity or IQ decline. In Angul and Damanjodi in Odisha, an ICMR assessment found 2.35% and 2.04% respiratory impairment, respectively, among community members.Experts warn that such findings suggest deeper environmental lapses. “If residents show structural lung changes, it strongly indicates that dust suppression and emission control measures are nowhere near sufficient,” said Dr Pritpal Kaur, senior consultant, Pulmonology, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Delhi. She added that community-level exposure points to presence of fugitive dust, inadequate green buffers and outdated dust-control technology.Despite the red flags, mining companies told govt they already provided wide-ranging healthcare in affected areas. Coal India Limited runs 64 hospitals, 300 dispensaries and 18 mobile vans, while NLC India Ltd and Singareni Collieries conduct periodic screening through Occupational Health Centres.But public health specialists say these initiatives fall short of the long-term surveillance mining communities need. “Health camps and mobile units are episodic and basic,” said Dr Neetu Jain of PSRI Hospital. “Only structured programmes with regular screenings, specialist clinics and environmental audits can catch disease early and prevent irreversible damage.”The health ministry said it maintained coordination with the ministry of coal and district authorities to run national programmes relating to respiratory diseases, but experts believe the new data underscores the need for more rigorous monitoring and stronger environmental safeguards in India’s mining belts.","Residents in mining belts face risks comparable to those for workers directly involved in extraction.

'Maligning Hindu Way Of Life': PM Modi Calls Out Colonial Mindset Over 'Hindu Rate Of Growth' Label

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Saturday said India was witnessing a “psychological renaissance” as it shook off the slavery mindset, which was reflected in its slow pace of development being termed as Hindu rate of growth, and asserted that the country was now the growth-driver of the global economy.The PM said India was being showered with plaudits like “global powerhouse” or “global growth engine” when it was the fastest growing major economy. But when it gr-ew at a rate between 2% and 3%, the term “Hindu rate of growth” was coined to describe its slow pace, he said.“Do you think the act of linking a country’s economic growth to the faith of its people and their identity was without any reason? No, it was reflective of the mindset of slavery,” he said at the HT Leadership Summit, adding no one was using the term when India clocked a high rate of gro-wth. GDP grew at a robust 8.2% in the second quarter.The so-called intellectuals saw no communalism in a phrase like “Hindu rate of growth” that made Hindu civilisation and culture synonymous with poverty and unproductivity, he said.The British mocked Indian tradition to strip people of self-confidence, Modi said, adding that his govt was working to restore the country’s prominence in a host of sectors. Modi said India was now in a different league at a time when the world was talking of a slowdown. India was scripting the chapter of growth and has become a pillar of trust amid “crisis of trust” in the world, he added. “India’s journey today is not merely about development. It is also about a change of mindset. It is also a journey of psychological renaissance,” the PM said.",PM Narendra Modi said India was witnessing a “psychological renaissance” as it shook off the slavery mindset.

Sanchar Saathi App Row In LS: Cong Flags Privacy Fears, Scindia Says 'Snooping Not Possible'

NEW DELHI: A new controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users for the needs of law enforcement agencies and disaster management officials.The matter, which has been in discussion for over five years now, had seen a suggestion by the mobile phone operators lobby, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), that govt order compulsory activation of A-GPS technology. This uses satellite and mobile data to give accurate and accelerated location of an individual. However, no action has been taken on the matter by the ministry of electronics and IT (Meity), which had been conducting talks with the industry — both mobile operators as well as device makers. Currently, phone operators provide location of individuals by tracking users through mobile towers, which lack pinpoint accuracy, while also being delayed in giving the coordinates.Sources said not much progress had been made in five years around implementation over issues related to user privacy as well as reluctance of device makers such as Apple and Samsung over mandated activation. The device makers argue that user consent needs to be taken before activation of pinpoint satellite-based location tracking.Also, they have expressed fears that other service providers, and even hackers, may misuse the always-on location tracking services, violating user privacy.The issue has come to the fore at a time when govt rescinded on a plan to mandate pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app after outcry over possible state surveillance as well as user privacy violations. In this case too, global manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung had told the department of telecom — which had issued the pre-installation order — of their objections to the measure, citing user privacy.",New controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users.

Winter Session Of Parliament: Bills On Atomic Energy, Excise On Agenda; Oppn Gears Up For SIR

NEW DELHI: Govt will soon undertake “comprehensive” reforms of Customs to make it more transparent and ease compliance, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Saturday.“There are quite a few things to do. There is the complete overhaul of the Customs area. We need to have a lot more simplified Customs department for people to feel that it is not tiresome and cumbersome for them to comply with the expectations in the rules, to make it more transparent,” Sitharaman said at an event here.The FM said govt had undertaken reforms of the Income Tax Act and ensured that income tax is no longer seen as a ""tiresome exercise”. She said measures had been taken to ensure transparency, faceless assessment had been introduced and reforms in tax administration had been undertaken.“Now the same virtues have to be brought to Customs…” she said, adding that the aim was to introduce technology to scan and clear goods with minimal interference of officials and end “discretion”.“We are looking at it in that sort of way comprehensively... We have brought down Customs duties over the last two years steadily, but in those few items where we are still considered to be over the optimal rate, we will bring them down as well. So, Customs is my next big cleaning up assignment if I can say,” Sitharaman said when asked about the next “big bang” reforms that govt was planning to undertake.","Nirmala Sitharaman: Govt will soon undertake “comprehensive’ reforms of Customs to make it more transparent and ease compliance.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

KOLKATA: The pre-hearing phase of Bengal’s SIR of electoral rolls is nearing completion with nearly 100% of 7.6 crore voters’ data having already been digitised. But, between 28 lakh and 30 lakh voters will, in all probability, have to attend poll officials’ hearings if they want to stay on the rolls as they remain unmapped (data not matching with the 2002 roll).All these unmapped voters will get notices to appear for in-person hearings and will have to produce one of the 13 SIR documents that EC has approved for Bengal. The hearings will be held between Dec 16 and Feb 7 next year before the publication of the final electoral rolls on Feb 14. Besides this number, till Saturday afternoon, 54.6 lakh voters remained untraceable or were categorised as dead or duplicate. These names will be deleted from the SIR draft list to be published on Dec 16, officials said. EC’s deadline to complete this phase of SIR ends Thursday.“A little over 7% (54.6 lakh) of the 99.4% digitised enumeration forms are now ‘uncollectible’ and these names will not be included in the draft SIR roll,” a senior EC official said. But voters can challenge and file fresh enrolment applications under Form 6 if they want to challenge this. Around 23.7 lakh voters have died, 19 lakh have shifted, 10.1 lakh are untraceable, and 1.2 lakh are duplicate voters. EC will publish a separate list of voters who have collected forms but are yet to return them to BLOs. These names (around 39,000), too, will not be included in draft rolls.","The pre-hearing phase of Bengal’s SIR of electoral rolls is nearing completion with nearly 100% of 7.6 crore voters’ data having already been digitised.

'Black Day': Owaisi Targets Modi Govt, Questions Acquittals In Babri Masjid Demolition Case

BERHAMPORE/KOLKATA:The programme, organised by suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir at Beldanga, happened under heavy security. Authorities reported no clashes. Kabir addressed about 400 people from a two-tier stage set nearly a kilometre from the proposed mosque site, introduced two clerics described as being from Saudi Arabia, and cut a ceremonial ribbon amid cries of “Nara-e-Takbeer, Allahu Akbar”.“There is nothing unconstitutional about this. Building a place of worship is a constitutional right. Babri Masjid will be built,” Kabir declared, framing the project as what he called “emotional restitution” for the 1992 demolition.Claiming threats over the naming of the mosque after Mughal emperor Babar, Kabir invoked numbers to defend the project: “There are 40 crore Muslims in the country and four crore in this state. Can we not build one mosque here?”The scale of mobilisation spilled into commerce. Brick kiln owner Abdul Bashir said he sold 32,000 bricks at Rs 10 a piece — above the usual Rs 8 rate — earning over Rs 3 lakh. Seven catering agencies prepared biryani for 30,000 people. A Kabir aide told PTI food alone cost Rs 30 lakh and the total budget crossed Rs 70 lakh. Donation boxes were circulated, and an SBI account with a QR code in the name of “West Bengal Islamic Foundation of India” was announced.TMC sought to distance itself. Party spokesman Kunal Ghosh said people had the right to build religious structures on private land, but warned that using such events to “spread religious venom” for political gain crossed a line. BJP launched a blistering attack. “This so-called mosque project is not a religious effort but a political one, designed to inflame emotions and consolidate vote banks,” said Amit Malviya. Former Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh accused TMC of stoking communal passions before 2026 polls.CM Mamata Banerjee on X warned against forces “igniting fire of communalism” and said Bengal’s soil “has never bowed down to division”.","The programme, organised by suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir at Beldanga, happened under heavy security.

NEW DELHI: Biocon will fully integrate its biosimilars arm, Biocon Biologics into the parent, in a deal valuing the unit at $5.5 billion.The move is aimed at creating a unified biopharma powerhouse, and to strengthen its global position to lead in diabetes, oncology, and immunology — therapeutic areas that together account for nearly 40% of global pharma revenues, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon said on Saturday.Biocon will acquire the remaining stake in Biocon Biologics from Serum Institute Life Sciences (Serum), Tata Capital and Activ Pine through a share swap of 70.28 Biocon shares for every 100 Biocon Biologics shares, at a price of Rs 405.78 per Biocon share.Further, Biocon will acquire the residual stake held by Mylan (Viatris) for $815 million, split between $400 million in cash and $415 million through a share swap of 61.7 Biocon shares for every 100 Biocon Biologics shares at a price of Rs 405.78 per Biocon share.“The combined entity will offer a unique portfolio spanning biosimilars, insulins, GLP-1 peptides and complex generics, positioning Biocon among the few global players with scale in both generics and biologics. Further, we will combine the synergies in oncology and immunology with the products, in biosimilars and generics,” said Mazumdar-Shaw.As the only company operating globally with both biosimilar insulins and generic versions of complex peptides, including GLP-1s, Biocon is poised to address the rapidly expanding ‘diabesity’ market, according to a company statement.The company’s board also approved raising additional capital, of up to Rs 4,500 crore ($500 million) through Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), subject to shareholder approval. The proceeds of the QIP will be largely utilised towards the cash component payable to Viatris.After the transaction and planned fundraise, the promoters’ stake in Biocon is expected to drop to around 44.4%.Biocon Biologics chief executive Shreehas Tambe will become CEO and managing director of the combined entity post-integration, and Kedar Upadhye will be the chief financial officer. Biocon CEO Siddharth Mittal will transition to a group leadership role, the statement added. The swap ratios have been approved by the board based on independent valuations by EY.Explaining the move, Mazumdar-Shaw said, “We had created Biocon Biologics as a separate entity to attract investments and for a strategic global focus on biosimilars. Over the years, we did that successfully, even acquiring Viatris’ biosimilars business for $3 billion. But markets kept devaluing both Biocon and Biocon Biologics because of debt overhang and holding company discount. Now the board feels it’s a better decision to stay together and consolidate, as it gives us a much stronger balance sheet. ”","Biocon will fully integrate its biosimilars arm, Biocon Biologics into the parent.

Slap UN sanctions on LeT, JeM: India, US

NEW DELHI: Even as uncertainty looms over the Quad summit, the grouping held a meeting of its counterterrorism working group and unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.In a joint statement, the members also expressed their condolences for the “heinous terror incident” near Red Fort in Delhi last month, called for the perpetrators, organisers and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice, and urged all UN member states to cooperate in doing so.With India and the US yet to finalise a bilateral trade agreement that is crucial for their relationship, the Quad summit could not take place this year, and there’s no formal word on when India might be able to host it in 2026. However, Quad has remained engaged at the level of officials on issues of interest in the Indo-Pacific. In Sept, Indiahosted counterterrorismworkshops that included a technical exchange on misuse of Unmanned Aerial Systems/drones by terrorists and a seminar on preventing terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technologies, including for terror-financing.During the meeting last week, the Quad member countries exchanged assessments on the terrorism threat landscape, including developments in the Indo-Pacific region.“They discussed the full spectrum of counterterrorism cooperation and measures that could be used to address existing and emerging challenges. They underscored the importance of ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains open and free from the threats of terrorism,” said the joint statement.A Tabletop Exercise (TTx) on “Counter Terrorism Operations in the Urban Environment” was also conducted. The TTx provided CT experts an opportunity to share their best practices and identify potential opportunities for joint operational preparedness to respond to complex terrorist scenarios, said the statement.“The Quad partners reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen cooperation in multilateral fora. They also emphasised the value of continued information sharing on terrorists, terrorist organisations and their proxies,” it said.India and the US have called for additional designation of IS and al-Qaida affiliates, and LeT and JeM and their proxy groups, supporters, sponsors, financiers and backers under UN 1267 sanctions regime, ensuring they face a global asset freeze. The two renewed their commitment to strengthen multilateral cooperation in countering terrorism including in UN, Quad, FATF.","The Quad condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.

The PM is expected to reiterate India’s position seeking early end to the Russia-Ukraine war and a return to dialogue and diplomacy. Putin had hosted Modi for a private dinner during the latter’s Russia visit last year for the annual summit.Putin’s main engagements are scheduled for Friday, beginning with a visit to Rajghat, followed by a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The leaders will hold talks at Hyderabad House for the main summit. After lunch with Modi, Putin will participate in India-Russia Business Forum.

In addition to the main talks with Narendra Modi, the programme includes a visit to the Russia-India Business Forum and participation in the launch ceremony of the RT TV channel in India,” Ushakov said.He added key aspects of trade and economic cooperation would be discussed. “In 2024, the bilateral trade turnover increased by 12%, up to $63.6 billion. We have many large-scale promising projects in various areas, including industrial cooperation, innovative technologies, transport, peaceful space exploration, mining, healthcare and labour migration progra-mmes,” he said, adding both sides were strengthening cooperation in politics and security, economy and finance, transport and logistics, science and technology, education and culture.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Tough to give India S-500 systems as of now, says official

NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Thursday agreed to further enhance their expansive defence partnership, including through collaboration in niche military technologies and stronger defence-industrial cooperation, which is likely to see Moscow continuing as New Delhi’s leading arms supplier for the foreseeable future, reports Rajat Pandit.Ahead of the Modi-Putin summit, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov stressed ties were based on “a deep sense of trust, common principles and mutual respect” while inking a protocol on “ongoing and prospective areas” of defence cooperation.The 22nd inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation, co-chaired by the ministers, underlined India’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy despite mounting pressure from the US and EU to distance itself from Russia.Sources said discussions ranged from India acquiring additional S-400 Triumf air defence systems and their surface-to-air missiles in large numbers to upgrading IAF’s Sukhoi-30MKI fighter fleet and arming them with long-range R-37 and RVV-BD air-to-air missiles.The joint production of advanced variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as procurement of short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba air defence systems also figured in the talks.“It will be difficult for Russia to supply advanced S-500 air defence systems as of now even if India wants them. Its fifth-generation Sukhoi-57 fighters are also on offer, but India is yet to take a decision,” an official said.Taking note during the meeting of the special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia, Rajnath Singh said India is determined to expand the capacity of its indigenous defence industry for both local production and exports under the aegis of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ policy.Belousov, in turn, said Russian defence industry was ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in defence production, highlighting that both the countries were “united by many years of friendship and strategic cooperation”.India also wants Russia to expedite deliveries of critical military hardware that have been hugely delayed due to the Ukraine war. These include the two remaining squadrons of the five S-400 squadrons contracted for $5.43 billion in 2018 as well as the advanced Akula-class nuclear attack submarine, which was supposed to arrive this year on a 10-year lease under the $3 billion deal signed in March 2019. “Russia says the two S-400 squadrons will be delivered next year, while the submarine will come in 2028,” a source said.India plans to acquire another five S-400 squadrons, while defence ministry has also cleared the Rs 10,000 crore procurement of 280 of its missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km to replenish stocks used during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities with Pakistan as well as build reserves, as was earlier reported by TOI.IAF also wants R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm its upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters. This will counter Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 long-range missiles that initially caught it off-guard during Operation Sindoor.Advanced lighter versions of BrahMos missiles, whose strike range has already been enhanced to 450km from the initial 290km and will eventually go up to 800km, are also on the cards.While the heavyweight Sukhoi fighters armed with BrahMos missiles had carried out long-range precision strikes against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, the plan now is to go for smaller air-launched BrahMos-NG missiles that can be carried by lightweight jets as well.The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles with a 2.8-Mach speed becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.","India and Russia agree to further enhance their expansive defence partnership.

IndiGo says more cancellation in next few days

NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise after IndiGo reported widespread operational disruptions and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across its network since late November 2025.Civil Aviation Minister reviewed the situation with senior MoCA officials and IndiGo’s top management, directing the airline and all relevant aviation bodies to take urgent steps to assist passengers and stabilise operations. The Ministry said it is keeping a “close watch” on the situation, according to DGCA's statement cited by ANI.""In addition, the Civil Aviation Minister has also held a meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India and instructed AAI to inform all airport directors that they should constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. He also directed DGCA to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,"" according to the released statement.Apart from the ministry, DGCA, in a detailed review meeting chaired by the Director General (Civil Aviation), flagged concerns over IndiGo cancelling 170–200 flights per day, a level significantly higher than normal for the country’s largest airline.IndiGo attributed the disruptions to transitional challenges from the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) Civil Aviation Requirements, which came into effect in two phases — 01 July 2025 and 01 November 2025 — following court directions.The airline said the new fatigue-management rules, crew-planning issues, and winter operational constraints have sharply impacted scheduling stability.DGCA has directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest and ensure that the current situation does not lead to fare increases.IndiGo has been instructed to submit:As DGCA released its statement assuring firm corrective action and close monitoring, IndiGo, however, informed the regulator that stabilising its network will require a short transition period. The airline told DGCA that additional cancellations will continue over the next two to three days as part of its schedule-reset effort aimed at restoring roster balance and preventing further last-minute disruptions, as reported by PTI.IndiGo has also conveyed that it will proactively scale down flight operations starting December 8 to minimise passenger inconvenience and allow crew-planning teams to rebuild buffers eroded over recent weeks. According to the airline, this controlled reduction in operations is essential to streamline rosters, align crew availability with revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms and ensure that fatigue-management standards are fully complied with.The carrier has assured DGCA that corrective measures are already underway and that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026. IndiGo said its recovery plan includes accelerated crew recruitment, intensified training cycles and a phased reintroduction of flights once adequate staffing and roster resilience are secured.",The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise.

NEW DELHI: India's largest airline, IndiGo , continued to face a major operational breakdown on Friday as pilot-rostering issues escalated into massive flight cancellations for the fourth straight day.More than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across airports nationwide. The crisis, largely triggered by an unexpected pilot shortage under new duty-time rules, has forced the airline into emergency schedule cuts and triggered a regulatory intervention.Airports reported chaotic scenes, with passengers waiting over 12 to 24 hours, organising protests, and complaining about a lack of communication and even misplaced baggage. Some said they had boarded their aircraft only to be asked to deboard later when flights were abruptly cancelled.IndiGo, which usually operates around 2,300 flights daily with a fleet of over 400 aircraft, has seen its On-Time Performance collapse to 19.7%, down from 35% the day before.IndiGo announced a full-day suspension of all departures from Delhi Airport till 11:59 pm on Friday, intensifying disruption that had already seen more than 300 cancellations in 48 hours up to Thursday.Multiple airports — including Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Goa — also issued lists of cancelled flights as the ripple effect spread across the network.In a statement, IndiGo said, “We confirm that all IndiGo domestic flights departing from Delhi Airport (DEL) on Dec 5, 2025 stand cancelled till 11:59PM. We express our profound apologies to all our valued customers and stakeholders who have been significantly impacted by these unforeseen events.”Passengers across multiple airports expressed anger and helplessness as IndiGo’s massive delays and cancellations left thousands stranded with little clarity or assistance.Many said there was no proper communication, food, or water as they waited for hours. Staff shortages and new crew duty rules have pushed operations into disarray, resulting in nearly 1,000 flights being cancelled over the past few days, with disruptions now stretching into the fourth consecutive day.The airline however listed steps being taken to assist stranded travellers stating that:The airline issued a detailed public apology on Friday, acknowledging the scale of the crisis. In its statement, IndiGo said, “We do deeply apologize and understand how difficult the past few days have been for many of you. While this will not get resolved overnight, we assure you that we will do everything in our capacity to help you in the meantime and to bring our operations back to normal at the earliest.”IndiGo added that December 5 ""should be the day with the highest number of cancellations, as we are doing all that is necessary to reboot all our systems and schedules for progressive improvement starting tomorrow.""The airline also said its teams were working in coordination with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the DGCA to restore normalcy. ""Our teams are working to reinstate regular operations in alignment with the Ministry and DGCA,"" it added.IndiGo announced several support measures for affected passengers and promised automatic refunds. The airline said, “We will ensure that all refunds for your cancellations will be processed automatically to your original mode of payment. Full waiver on all cancellations/reschedule requests for bookings between 05 December 2025 to 15 December 2025.”IndiGo’s large-scale cancellations have triggered a sharp spike in domestic airfares, with last-minute ticket prices on major routes touching record highs as passengers scrambled for alternatives.According to MakeMyTrip (MMT) data, same-day non-stop flights from Delhi to several metros cost up to double the rates for nearby dates.IndiGo has urged passengers to check flight status before leaving home, as widespread cancellations continue. In its advisory, the airline said:IndiGo says it has been hit by multiple unforeseen operational challenges—including crew shortages, winter schedule changes, weather issues, tech problems, and airport congestion.However, the biggest trigger is the stricter Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) rules that came into effect on November 1. The new norms increased weekly rest, extended night-duty definitions and reduced permitted night landings from six to two, following years of pilot fatigue complaints.These rules were mandated by the DGCA after a Delhi High Court order. Airlines had lobbied for a delay, but DGCA enforced them with only limited relaxations.The latest DGCA FDTL rules mandate:The stricter night-duty limits reduced crew availability sharply—affecting IndiGo the most due to its massive network of late-night operations.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Friday it was temporarily relaxing specific provisions of the new Phase-II Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms for IndiGo’s A320 fleet, including rules on night duty between 0000–0650 hours and restrictions on night operations. The exemption is valid until February 10, 2026.The regulator emphasised that the exemption is being granted “in public interest” to ensure continuity of essential air services but warned that safety standards must be strictly followed and the approval could be withdrawn if safety is compromised.IndiGo is now required to submit fortnightly progress reports on crew utilisation and steps taken to improve availability. The airline also has to present a roadmap within 30 days to ensure full compliance with FDTL standards.IndiGo had approached DGCA citing severe operational difficulties following the rollout of new FDTL norms, which lowered the number of night landings allowed per pilot. According to details shared with the regulator, the airline is short of both captains and first officers for its A320 fleet.For December, IndiGo reported availability of 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers, lower than what the new rules demand. The requirement rose significantly after Phase-II norms were implemented.These numbers highlight what officials describe as a crew shortage that IndiGo underestimated, leading to cascading delays and cancellations. On Friday alone, more than 500 IndiGo flights were delayed or cancelled, severely disrupting travel across the country.DGCA noted that current disruptions stem from operational constraints, unpredictable weather and rising seasonal demand. “As we now approach the fog season, the peak holiday period and the marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges,” the regulator said.Pilot unions have strongly criticised IndiGo’s resource planning.The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) said the airline “enforced a hiring freeze even after knowing the impact of the new DGCA rules.”It added that while all other airlines planned ahead and hired adequately, IndiGo “inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze, entered non-poaching arrangements, maintained a pilot pay freeze through cartel-like behaviour, and demonstrated other short-sighted planning practices.”The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said the disruptions point to a failure of proactive resource planning and alleged attempts to pressure the DGCA to roll back stricter duty-time rules.The Ministry of Civil Aviation has directed IndiGo and other airlines to act immediately to restore services. In its order, the ministry said:The ministry added that the government remains “fully alert to the woes of air passengers” and will take “every possible measure, including rule exemptions” to restore stability.IndiGo has said its operations will stabilise within 48 hours, noting that its teams are making “calibrated adjustments” to rotations and night schedules. The airline is redeploying crew on high-stress routes, pre-cancelling select flights and reorganising aircraft rotations.In its meeting with DGCA on Thursday, IndiGo assured that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026, the deadline for which it has sought temporary exemptions.“Our frontline staff and the entire team remain dedicated to restoring normal operations and helping every customer with care and respect,” the airline said.While operations may improve in the short term, IndiGo’s long-term stabilisation now hinges on how quickly it can rebuild its crew strength and fully comply with duty-time regulations that the rest of the industry has already implemented.","India's largest airline, IndiGo, continued to face a major operational breakdown on Friday as pilot-rostering issues escalated into massive flight cancellations for the fourth straight day.

Now boarding - Frustration



Refunds ... but at what cost?



What the airline has offered



No hellos, no goodbyes!



IndiGo feels the heat



What’s next



At airports, there was a time when a crackling announcement - ""This is the last call for ...” - meant panic, urgency, a frantic dash through terminals. When a voice reverberating in mechanical voice announced, “your flight has been delayed”, it was no less than a nightmare as it tested the patience. However, today, for IndiGo passengers, now these same words land like reassurance.It means the flight exists. It means the crew showed up. It means travel is still possible. In a week when cancellations ran into four digits a day, travellers like Soubik Majumder clung to every announcement not as a warning, but as hope because silence, not sound, has become the true alarm.With abrupt cancellations running into hundreds, sometimes even over 1,000 flights a day in the last week, the news of a delay has, ironically, offered some relief.Majumder had booked an IndiGo flight in advance from Delhi to visit Agartala for his brother’s wedding.However, what should have been a pleasant ride home turned into a desperate hunt for buses, trains and anything that moved, all in a bid to reach the ceremony on time.He had booked the tickets one month before his actual flying date but the ongoing chaos and disruptions left him with nothing but a cancelled flight.“I booked my ticket almost a month in advance so that I wouldn’t have to face any hassle.But because of the changes that happened later due to the new aviation law, I am now facing problems for the same ticket that I booked one month earlier,” he told TOI.Delays came first, followed by endless queues and cancellations and gradually, everything erupted into utter chaos, turning airports into scenes similar to a fish market, with suitcases scattered everywhere.IndiGo’s flight disruption worsened on Friday as the airline cancelled over 1,000 flights across major cities. After remaining silent for three days during the crisis, CEO Pieter Elbers finally issued a video apology, expressing regret for the inconvenience caused to passengers.Delhi bore the brunt with 235 cancellations, followed by Mumbai with 104, Bengaluru with 102 , and Hyderabad with 84 cancelled flights.For many passengers, the trouble began long before the cancellation alert flashed on screens. Vaishnavi Shree, travelling from Tirupati to Delhi, recalled the confusion that unfolded in real time.""There’s only one direct flight from Tirupati to Delhi, it departs at 9 am and usually lands by around 11.30 pm. We completed all the usual procedures, but while going through security, I overheard a guard mention that the Delhi flight might be cancelled. No one seemed sure, so we continued to the gate,"" she said.The uncertainty only grew. ""The flight was delayed first by one hour, then two and finally it was cancelled,"" she said.Passengers were offered two choices: reschedule for the next day with hotel accommodation and meals, or cancel their tickets. But those who urgently needed to reach Delhi were left stranded, with connecting routes via Hyderabad, Bengaluru or Chennai either fully booked or cancelled.Playback singer and performer Abhijit Ghoshal told TOI, 'I paid around Rs 14,000 for my flight. It wasn't cancelled, but it was delayed by nearly six hours. After landing in Mumbai at 8.51 pm, it took 40 minutes just for the doors to open, and I received my luggage only at 10.45 pm.”Sunil D Shaligram said his son remained stuck at the airport for over 14 hours. ""Despite repeated requests, we received no assistance,"" he told PTI.Another parent, S Arora, said the airline ""should have foreseen the chaos their decisions would trigger.""Several passengers said they were asked to deboard after being told there was ""no pilot available.""Stranded travellers are now demanding clearer communication from the airline and better arrangements to deal with disruptions of this scale.To support affected passengers, IndiGo announced automatic refunds for cancelled flights.The airline said, ""All refunds for cancelled flights will be processed automatically to your original mode of payment. Additionally, we are offering a full waiver on all cancellations and reschedule requests for bookings between 5 and 15 December 2025.""However, frustration runs far deeper than refunds, with passengers now facing fares nearly ten times higher than their original bookings. Many received cancellation alerts just hours before departure.""My flight was at 9.00 am and I got the message at 4.00 am,"" Majumder said. ""In a way, it was slightly helpful that I didn’t have to go to the airport ... but when you find out four to five hours before your flight that it's cancelled, you can't do much urgently.""Talking about the refunds, he added, ""IndiGo is covering the amount I originally paid, yes, but that doesn't solve the problem ... I can't find anything below Rs 50,000–70,000, and even then only connecting flights, no direct options.""After spending roughly Rs 8,000 for his tickets, Majumder believed his plans were set, until the chaos left him scrambling. ""They are charging ten times that now ... it feels like the aviation industry is taking advantage of the public,"" he said.Despite already missing part of the family wedding, he insisted he would try every possible route to attend the remaining ceremonies.Nomad Travel CEO and former Travel Agents' Association of India president Ajay Prakash told PTI, ""If a Rs 10,000 ticket is being sold at Rs 60,000 ... I would call it black marketing, profiteering."" He argued the sector is now driven ""purely by profit motives,"" with IndiGo's 64–65% market share giving it near-monopoly power.Fare spikes followed the chaos: after 1,000 flights were cancelled, a one-way economy ticket on SpiceJet from Kolkata to Mumbai touched Rs 90,000, while Air India’s Mumbai–Bhubaneswar fare hit Rs 84,485.It wasn't just airfares that shot up. Ghoshal said even cab prices had tripled. ""My usual fare ... is between Rs 550 and Rs 650, but yesterday ... it was showing Rs 1,871.""He added the crisis has hit livelihoods. ""Many of my peer musicians have missed their concerts ... We artists usually fly on the day of the performance itself,"" he said, calling the situation ""ridiculous"" and deserving serious action if caused by mismanagement.Another passenger, Ritik Jha, also told TOI how his entire travel plan collapsed.“Initially the flight was scheduled for December 3 at 9.15 am, booked much in advance — in October — and was cancelled a few hours before take-off,” he said. Jha had booked four tickets at Rs 8,855 per person, but the last-minute cancellation forced him to look for alternatives that were 300–400% higher than his original fare.“Air India was charging Rs 33,353 per person for two of us in the morning, while Akasa was Rs 22,532 per person in the afternoon — which again caused delays for a planned event,” he said, adding that the entire schedule went haywire, leading to “inflated costs, delays, and complete chaos.”Jha also mentioned that an international client travelling with him faced similar issues. “He was supposed to fly from Pune to Bengaluru with IndiGo, but the last-minute cancellation made him take a connecting flight via Chennai, again costing much higher and causing delays and chaos.”Beyond refunds, IndiGo has been providing accommodation and meals to stranded passengers. Shree said, ""We were provided accommodation and food at Fortune Grand ITC.""""We got the cab that they (IndiGo airline) provided, and the food is there, three meals a day, and the hotel and everything is good.""For Ghoshal, however, the experience was far less satisfying.""On December 2, when I flew from Ranchi to Delhi and it was delayed in the Delhi–Prayagraj sector, they offered very meagre food. The quantity of food for delayed passengers was almost 30% of a usual thali. But at Prayagraj airport on December 4, IndiGo did give snacks, packets and tasty food (lunch) at around 3 pm.""The disruption at IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share, has not just crippled aviation operations, it has pushed passengers into deep emotional distress. Weddings, work commitments, medical emergencies and even final goodbyes now hang in uncertainty.In Guwahati, one passenger described the agony, “I have come all the way from Shillong this morning. My husband passed away, and I have come here to transport the casket to Kolkata so he can be buried in his hometown.”“We booked an IndiGo flight, and till now there is no information on whether it will take off. I don’t know if the flight will be cancelled or if it will actually depart,” the flyer told ANI.Another flyer from Delhi reached the airport at 2 in the afternoon, excited to attend an important wedding function, waited all day at the airport, only to return back home after spending almost 12 chaotic hours at the airport, and no flight in sight.InterGlobe Aviation, also known as IndiGo, is reeling from the disruption not just on the ground, but also at Dalal Street. In the past 5 trading sessions, the airline’s stock price has tumbled down by over 7%.The company’s stock has been under pressure for four consecutive sessions, slipping 7.23% on the Bombay Stock Exchange and 7.30% on the NSE over the period.On Friday, it closed 1.22% lower at Rs 5,371.30 on the BSE after falling as much as 3.15% intraday to Rs 5,266, while on the NSE it ended 1.27% down at Rs 5,367.50. Since December 1, the firm’s market capitalisation has eroded by Rs 16,190.64 crore to Rs 2,07,649.14 crore.IndiGo's on-time performance also collapsed amid worsening operational disruptions, plunging to just 8.5% on Thursday, according to data from the civil aviation ministry.The decline has been sharp, as the airline’s OTP dropped from 35% on Tuesday to 19.7% on Wednesday before hitting single digits a day later, a major setback for an airline that has long positioned punctuality as its key strength.The government on Saturday intervened to control spiralling ticket prices as IndiGo’s operational crisis entered another day, triggering widespread cancellations, passenger unrest and uncertainty over return travel.The ministry of civil aviation said it had taken “serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and invoked its regulatory powers to ensure “fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes.”The ministry has also instructed IndiGo to promptly process all outstanding passenger refunds.It has been mandated that refunds for all cancelled or disrupted flights must be completed by 8:00 pm on Sunday, December 7.Additionally, airlines have been directed not to charge rescheduling fees to passengers whose travel arrangements were impacted. The ministry cautioned that any delays or failure to comply with the refund processing will result in immediate regulatory measures.Meanwhile, passengers who have even travelled one way are still worried about their return plans. Hardik Sharma, who was one of the lucky ones who got to board their scheduled flight from Delhi to Vizag, is now feeling anxious about his return journey.“Thankfully, my flight was on time, but there’s still uncertainty about my return flight to Delhi on Sunday night”, he said.With thousands stranded nationwide, Delhi airport released a statement on Saturday afternoon saying operations were gradually improving, “We are glad to update that IndiGo flight operations are now steadily resuming and getting back to normalcy following the brief disruption. Please check the status of your booking and flight before leaving home.”In order to help passengers with no travel options, the South Central Railway announced four special trains to Chennai, Mumbai and Shalimar (Kolkata) to clear the extra rush.The move followed long queues and overcrowding at the airport due to the large-scale grounding of flights.Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said restoring normalcy across airports “remains the immediate priority”. He added that authorities are closely monitoring the airline’s scheduling network and compliance with pilot duty and rest norms.“The immediate priority for us is to bring back normalcy and provide all the support to the passengers. We are deeply observing this, and observing the FDTL norms, scheduling network. We will thoroughly look into this and ensure that all airlines follow due diligence,” he said.IndiGo, which usually operates around 2,300 flights a day, has been cancelling services to manage the worsening operational disruptions tied largely to crew shortages, causing massive distress for passengers and triggering knock-on effects across the aviation and railway networks.How long it will take for IndiGo to resolve the ongoing disruptions remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: passengers will end up paying a price far beyond just their airfares.Even if this chaos resolves within the coming days and normalcy returns soon, it is certain that neither the emotional damage caused to passengers can be undone nor the trust shaken in the reliability of the airline can be restored in the near future.IndiGo will fix its roster, the ministry will probe and issue new directives, and eventually airports will go back to being temples of impatience, not despair. But until then, every time a speaker crackles, passengers will inhale sharply - not worried they’re late, but relieved they’re still on the list.In a week when 'delay' became the new 'on time,' travellers learned the hardest lesson of all - that in aviation, the most expensive seat isn't business or premium economy. It’s certainty.","IndiGo has cancelled over 1,000 flights in the last week. CEO Pieter Elbers issued a video apology for the inconvenience caused to passengers. IndiGo announced automatic refunds for cancelled flights. Passengers are now demanding clearer communication from the airline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125805748,imgsize-714295,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-22.jpg"

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon Musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Who is Shahriar Tajbakhsh ?





Shahriar Tajbakhsh, the CTO and co-founder of Metaview AI, which sells software to help automate job interviews, joked about the $100,000 H-1B yearly visa fee and said 'make it per day'. The company recently created a social media stir as they did their hiring in India, the hub of H-1B, fearing neither the fee nor the prevalent sentiment in the US against H-1B. When the fee was announced in September, he called it a 'rounding error' compared to the value the H-1B staff members add to the team.""Make it per day,” he posted as the MetaView hiring posters in India went viral. ""I’ll set up a recurring payment,"" he added, making it clear that the fee does not matter to his company.""Yes, we still sponsor H-1Bs""; ""No, AI won't build itself,"" Metaview AI's recent hiring posters in India read.Iranian-origin Shahriar Tajbakhsh is a technology entrepreneur and engineer. He did his BSc in Computer Science from University College London. He worked at Palatir Technologies before starting Metaview in 2018. Metaview is London-based but now expanded to the US. Tajbaksh told Business Insider earlier this year that his company plans to submit more H-1B petitions in the next lottery and Trump's executive order will not change his belief that an organization's success or failure is a function of its people.Tajbakhsh, however, is not an H-1B. He revealed that he was relocating to the US on an EB-1 visa which is an employment-based, first preference visa for an individual of extraordinary abilities, or an outstanding professor or researcher, or a multinational executive or manager. ""When you sum up the value created by people's hard work, $100,000 just doesn't matter. The only way to build anything meaningful that changes people's lives is to have a world-class team — there's no shortcut around that. Trying to save money on talent is the most irresponsible thing a founder could possibly do,"" Tajbakhsh said.","Shahriar Tajbakhsh is the CTO and co-founder of Metaview AI, which sells software to help automate job interviews.

Democrat senator Ruben Gallego (Arizona) has expressed concern over the H-1B visa program and asked the Donald Trump administration how it would ensure Americans are not losing out on jobs. Gallego said companies are laying off Americans while hiring foreign workers on temporary H-1B visas. ""Such trends are concerning given the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, particularly recent graduates. At major public technology companies, employees between the ages of 21 and 25 made up 15 percent of the workforce in January 2023. By July 2025, that number had dropped to 6.7 percent. These statistics suggest that there are young American workers eager to be trained for and to fill these roles,"" the senator wrote.""Gen Z workers are struggling elsewhere in our economy too,"" he added.Citing the data from a Bank of America Institute report, Gallego claimed that over 13 per cent of of unemployed Americans in July were new entrants into the workforce or jobseekers with no prior work experience. This is the highest since 1988, according to the Richmond Federal Reserve, the letter added.""This trend is particularly concerning because the American dream has become unachievable for most young people.For example, the average student borrows over $30,000 to pursue a bachelor’s degree. But even this is no longer enough; since the start of 2020, the median home price has risen 55.7 percent, while average wages have only increased 26.6 percent. Moreover, a new report shows that childcare for one infant now costs more than rent in 17 states and more than in-state college tuition in 38 states,"" he wrote.Acknowledging the administration's Project Firewall, the senator asked whether the Department of Labor will pay special attention to companies that have laid off American workers while filing petitions for H-1B workers. ""How will you ensure companies make good faith efforts to fulfill all H-1B requirements, including those requiring prioritization of U.S. workers over H-1B employees?"" the senator wrote.","Ruben Gallego (Arizona) said companies are laying off Americans while hiring foreign workers on temporary H-1B visas.
