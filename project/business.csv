"Paddy variety in focus cuts cost, pollution in Delhi-NCR",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paddy-variety-in-focus-cuts-cost-pollution-in-delhi-ncr/articleshow/114234019.cms,"NEW DELHI: Short-duration paddy variety PR-126 , developed by Punjab Agricultural University , may be at the centre of controversy for being pushed by the AAP-led state govt despite its low yield but the benefit of it in terms of saving input cost is something which is not being factored in by opposition Congress that has raised its pitch against the variety.Besides reducing cost of farming, PR-126 has the potential to combat the menace of air pollution in Delhi-NCR as it gives enough post-harvesting window to farmers to prepare their farms for the next crop without resorting to stubble burning . So, more use of the short-duration variety means lesser episodes of biomass burning. Its result is, however, yet to be seen this year as peak harvest season is still a bit far.Unlike the most popular Pusa-44 variety, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), which takes 155-160 days to grow, the short-duration PR-126 variety takes just 123-125 days. Taking 30-35 days less time means not only saving input cost in terms of irrigation but also saving energy and precious groundwater.The flip side of it is, however, 4-5 quintal per acre less yield of PR-126 compared to Pusa-44 which gives 35-36 quintal per acre. Even at the milling stage, it gives 5 kg less rice and this prompted leader of opposition in Punjab assembly Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday to slam chief minister Bhagwant Mann for pushing PR-126.“The yield problem can, however, be resolved from the next season if the state opts for a high-yielding short-duration crop variety, Pusa-2090 , developed by IARI. This new variety matches Pusa-44 in terms of yield and PR-126 in terms of duration (123-125 days) to get mature and ready for harvest,” said an official in the agriculture ministry.The Pusa-2090 variety was, however, formally released this year only for Delhi. A few farmers in Punjab and Haryana have planted this new variety on a limited scale on an experimental basis, but it will take a couple of more years for its wider adoption.“Unlike Pusa-44 variety which matures in 155 to 160 days, the Pusa-2090 variety took just 120 to 125 days. Yields of both these varieties (34-35 quintal per acre) are almost the same,"" Shukhjeet Singh Bhangu, farmer from Kanakwal Bhanguan village of Sangrur district in Punjab, had told TOI last month.Bhangu, who planted Pusa-2090 in one acre of land on an experimental basis, said the new variety will give farmers an additional 30 days to prepare their farmlands for the next crops (mainly wheat), significantly reducing their reliance on stubble burning. He claimed to have distributed seeds of new variety to couple of more farmers in Sangruru district who have already harvested their paddy crops.The new variety will not only give farmers more time to prepare for next crop but also help them get equal yield at less input cost as they don't need to go for additional cycles of irrigation and spray if the crop is ready for harvest in 125 days instead of 155 days in the case of existing popular variety, Pusa-44.",Short-duration paddy variety PR-126 is at the centre of controversy for being pushed by the AAP-led state govt despite its low yield. But the benefit of it in terms of saving input cost is something which is not being factored in by opposition Congress.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114234040,imgsize-1260716,width-400,resizemode-4/114234040.jpg"

MUMBAI: Chief minister Eknath Shinde made a significant announcement in the state cabinet meeting on Monday. He announced a full toll waiver for light motor vehicles at all five toll nakas entering Mumbai. This order will be implemented from midnight.The toll nakas are managed by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( MSRDC ), which has given a toll collection contract to a private company at Mumbai’s five entry points until 2026.RTI data received by activist Anil Galgali reveals that MSRDC awarded the contract for the five entry points of Mumbai for Rs 2242.35 crores to MEP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd to collect tolls for constructing 31 flyovers and bridges in Mumbai. The toll nakas are located in Mulund, Dashiar, and Mankhurd .MSRDC informed Galgali that prior to 2010-11, MSRDC was collecting tolls on its own. “In the year 1999-2000, it collected Rs 28.35 crores. In the year 2010-2011, MEP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd was awarded the contract for toll collection, authorising collection up to November 19, 2026, for Rs 2242.35 crores. From 1999-2000 to 2015-2016, MSRDC spent Rs 119 crores on maintenance of these roads and bridges. MSRDC spent Rs 1058 crores on the construction of the 31 flyovers; this cost was to be recovered by the collection of tolls at the five entry points,” Galgali said.In August last year, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray demanded that the toll being collected at Mumbai’s entry points on the Western and Eastern Express Highways (WEH & EEH) should be scrapped immediately as the two roads were handed over by the MSRDC to the BMC.Galgali also wrote to CM Eknath Shinde and deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , demanding an audit of MEP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. Galgali said that an audit would reevaluate how much toll money was collected by the company from 2016 to 2023.“There are many flyovers which were constructed prior to the year 2000, at the cost of the state exchequer, for which toll is being collected. Also, private entities like MEP Infrastructure are being given a chance to earn huge profits. Because now both EEH and WEH are being maintained by the BMC, the toll must be scrapped,” Galgali said.",Chief minister Eknath Shinde made a significant announcement in the state cabinet meeting on Monday.

"India, US to ink Predator deal today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-to-ink-predator-deal-today/articleshow/114228911.cms,"NEW DELHI: India and the US on Tuesday will ink the $3.3 billion (Rs 28,000 crore) contract for 31 weaponised MQ-9B Predator drones, which will take the collective worth of lucrative Indian defence deals bagged by Washington to over $25 billion in less than two decades.The induction of 31 `hunter-killer’ high-altitude, long-endurance drones will boost India’s military capabilities in undertaking long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions and precision strikes against high-value targets, especially in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) where China is rapidly expanding its naval presence and turnaround facilities.Under the govt-to-govt deal with the US, which was cleared by the PM-led cabinet committee on security on Oct 9, deliveries of the 31 remotely-piloted aircraft systems with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, will begin in about four years and be completed in six years, a defence ministry official told TOI.A separate contract will also be inked on Tuesday with drone-manufacturer General Atomics -- which will assemble some of the fighter-sized MQ-9Bs in India -- for the global MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility to be set up here, with 34% of the components to be sourced from Indian companies.“There will be performance-based logistics (PBL) for the MQ-9Bs (15 Sea Guardians for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF) through the depot-level MRO for eight years or 1.5 lakh flying hours, whichever is earlier,” the official said.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the capabilities of the MQ-9Bs are considered far better than China’s existing armed drones like Cai Hong-4 and Wing Loong-II, which are also being supplied to Pakistan.While there will be no transfer of technology (ToT) in the MQ-9B deal, General Atomics will provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and others to develop such heavy-duty drones that are capable of firing missiles and precision-guided munitions on enemy targets before returning to their home bases to re-arm for their next mission like manned fighter jets.India plans to deploy the MQ-9B drones at ISR command and control centres at Arakkonam and Porbandar for the IOR and Sarsawa and Gorakhpur for the land borders.Only some NATO countries and close military allies of the US have the Predator or Reaper drones, which are controlled by satellites and have a proven track record in precision strikes in Afghanistan and other conflicts. Some critics, however, say the drones have largely operated in “uncontested air space” without facing a hostile air force or advanced surface-to-air missile systems.The MQ-9B contract will be the second largest deal that India has inked with the US after the induction of 11 C-17 Globemaster-III strategic-airlift aircraft by IAF at a cost of around $4.5 billion. The Navy, in turn, has inducted 12 P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft from the US for $3.2 billion.The IAF had also acquired 13 C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from the US for over $2.1 billion but lost one in a crash during a tactical low-level training sortie near Gwalior in March 2014, which killed the five personnel on board.","India and the US will ink the $3.3 billion (Rs 28,000 crore) contract for 31 weaponised MQ-9B Predator drones.

It is completely within Parliament’s legislative domain to consider whether an act can be classified as an offence or not,” the CJI-led bench said, adding, “We cannot use our power under Article 142 to create an offence.” This may not be completely true as SC, in its landmark Vishaka judgment on Aug 13, 1997, had created sexual harassment at workplaces as a distinct offence after recording that “the present civil and penal laws in India do not adequately provide for specific protection of women from sexual harassment in workplaces and that enactment of such legislation will take considerable time”. Parliament took 16 more years to enact Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act.A month-and-a-half ago, Delhi HC had not only entertained a PIL by advocate Gantavya Gulati seeking inclusion of non-consensual unnatural sex and sodomy as offences in BNS but also urged Centre to bring an ordinance to penalise these “offences” pending considerations for amendment to BNS.While granting Centre six months to take a holistic view on inclusion of these “offences” in BNS, HC had said there could not be a vacuum in crime & punishment. “...Centre made even non-consensual (unnatural) sex non-punishable.

The diplomatic ties between India and Canada hit the lowest on Monday after India decided to withdraw its high commissioner and some other ""targetted"" diplomats asserting that it has ""no faith"" in the Trudeau government. The move came after Canadian government, led by prime minister Justin Trudeau, attempted to implicate the Indian high commissioner in an investigation likely related to the murder of Sikh extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.India also issued a stern warning against the ""concocted"" allegations targeting its diplomat.India vehemently rejected the accusations against high commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, labeling them as ""preposterous imputations"" and attributing them to the ""political agenda of the Trudeau government that is centered around vote bank politics"". The ministry of external affairs (MEA) stated that India received a diplomatic communication from Canada, suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are ""persons of interest"" in an ongoing investigation in Canada.The relationship between India and Canada has been under significant strain since prime minister Trudeau's accusations in September last year, suggesting a ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar, who was shot dead in Surrey, British Columbia, in June 2022. New Delhi has repeatedly dismissed Trudeau's charges as ""absurd"". This, however, is not the first time India and Canada are staring at a historic low in its diplomatic ties under a Trudeau regime. Justin Trudeau’s father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who served as Canada’s fifteenth prime minister also had a difficult relationship with India much like his son Justin Trudeau.In 1974, Ottawa's foreign policy experts were outraged when India conducted nuclear tests, suspecting that the Canadian-designed and collaboratively constructed CIRUS reactor was used. Canada had previously assumed that India shared its ideological opposition to nuclear weapons development. The Indian tests challenged this assumption, forcing Canada to reevaluate its understanding of Asia's emerging strategic landscape.India later carried out nuclear tests in Pokhran, Rajasthan in 1998, motivated by various domestic and external factors, including a growing consensus among India's political elites and scientific community, the security threat from China following the 1962 Sino-Indian war, and China's nuclear tests in Lop Nor. The aftermath of the tests saw a deterioration in India's relations with Canada and much of the Western world.Canada perceived the Pokhran event as a betrayal by India, with policymakers in Ottawa worried that Indian nuclear tests would encourage other non-nuclear states to pursue similar capabilities. As a result, Canada halted tentative nuclear cooperation with India. The then Foreign Minister Mitchell Sharp expressed his disappointment, stating that the ""trust between the two countries was gone.""Canada's former PM Pierre Elliott Trudeau had warned Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi about the repercussions India would encounter if it developed nuclear weapons capabilities. Trudeau's India policy aligned with his positive stance towards Communist states like China and a rejection of Washington's expectations for Canada's foreign policy. Consequently, Canadian policymakers became wary of any attempts to seek reconciliation with India, particularly regarding civil nuclear energy cooperation. This position was eventually abandoned during the Harper administration, leading to the signing of the Canada–India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.Following India's nuclear tests in 1998, Canada imposed sanctions on the South Asian nation. According to reports, the Canadian foreign minister at the time, Lloyd Axworthy, initiated a ""crusade"" against India in response to the tests.The sanctions remained in place until 2001 when they were finally lifted. However, it took another nine years for India and Canada to sign a civil nuclear agreement, which occurred in 2010.The nuclear tests and subsequent sanctions strained the relationship between the two countries for a significant period, highlighting the complex dynamics of international diplomacy and the consequences of pursuing nuclear capabilities.More than the nuclear test, Pierre Trudeau’s failure to take action against the Khalistani forces dealt a serious blow to Indo-Canadian relations.Several terrorists from Punjab took refuge in Canada after the crackdown on militancy in the 1980s. One such terrorist was Talwinder Singh Parmar. He fled to Canada after killing two police personnel in Punjab in 1981. Parmar, a member of the Khalistani group Babbar Khalsa, advocated for attacks on Indian diplomatic missions abroad and mass murder.India asked for Parmar to be extradited, but the Pierre Trudeau administration denied the request. Additionally, even warnings from Indian intelligence agencies remained unheeded.The final blow came when all 329 people on board Air India Flight 182 (Kanishka), which was traveling from Toronto to London, UK, on June 23, 1985, were killed when a bomb concealed in two luggage detonated. The majority of those killed in the Kanishka bombing were Canadians. Parmar, who Pierre Trudeau protected, was the bombing of Kanishka’s mastermind. In Punjab, he was murdered by police in 1992. Posters honoring Parmar were seen all around Canada in June of this year.Talwinder Singh Parmar was among those arrested in connection with the Kanishka bombing, but he was all released, and only one person was found guilty.In 1982, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi complained to Pierre Trudeau about the meek Canadian response to the Khalistani challenge, according to Terry Milewski, a retired CBC correspondent and author of “Blood for Blood – Fifty Years of the Global Khalistan Project.”","India withdraws its high commissioner and some other ""targetted"" diplomats from Canada.

History with Trudeaus

NEW DELHI: Justin Trudeau 's aggression towards India coincides with the Canadian Prime Minister's sliding popularity ratings at home and growing dissent against him, which are being seen to have enhanced the need for him to woo the politically-significant Sikh community ahead of next year's federal elections.Amid complaints over rising cost of living, a struggling healthcare system, and growing crime rate, an Ipsos poll showed that just 26% saw Trudeau as the best PM candidate, 19 percentage points below Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.This comes after two electoral setbacks. Last month, the in-power Liberal Party lost in Montreal, seen as a safe seat, just three months after being defeated in a special election in Toronto after holding the seat for three decades. To make matters worse, Jagmeet Singh 's New Democratic Party withdrew support to the minority Liberal govt days before the Montreal loss. Singh has been a supporter of Khalistan There have been calls from Trudeau's party colleagues for him to step down, as many experts are predicting that the Liberals will face the same plight as the Conservatives in the UK. Trudeau is holding on after surviving two no-confidence motions in Parliament.Canada has over 7.7 lakh Sikhs, the fourth-largest ethnic community, with a section backing the demand for Khalistan.India was always skeptical of Trudeau's policy on pro-Khalistan separatists. In 2018, PM Narendra Modi met him on the sixth day of his first official visit to the country amid a controversy over an invitation for a dinner at the Canadian high commission to businessman Jaspal Atwal who was convicted but later acquitted in a plot to assassinate a Punjab minister in Vancouver Island in 1986. While the invitation was withdrawn, Trudeau sought to distance himself from the controversy.There was, however, no change in stance as the Trudeau govt refused to clamp down on protests outside Indian consulates, some of which saw demonstrators burning the Indian flag.On the 40th anniversary of Operation Bluestar, processions in Ontario and Toronto saw floats depicting the assassination of former PM Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards in 1984. The Canadian govt refused to stop a referendum on Khalistan, which was backed by Sikhs for Justice.Relations hit a low after Trudeau alleged that ""Indian agents"" were involved in the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. The Canadian PM made the accusations soon after his return from New Delhi after the G20 Summit in Sept. India not only denied the allegations but sought concrete evidence, which Canada has refused to provide.The two sides halted negotiations for a trade agreement and India temporarily stopped processing visas as it feared for the safety of its mission staff in Canada. Over 40 Canadian diplomats were withdrawn from missions in India after New Delhi raised the principle of reciprocity in staffing.Canada also sought to include India in a probe into alleged election interference.During a meeting with Trudeau on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in New Delhi last year, PM Modi had expressed concern over anti-India activities in Canada by extremists.This is, however, not the first time that separatists have caused major friction in bilateral ties between India and Canada. Trudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau, a former PM, was accused of mishandling ties with New Delhi as Canadian authorities had failed to act against Khalistani extremists in the 1980s.Elliott had refused India's request for extradition of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a member of Babbar Khalsa, who fled to Canada after being accused of killing two cops in Punjab. An alleged mastermind of the 1985 Kanishka bombing, he was killed in Punjab seven years later.","Canada has over 7.7 lakh Sikhs, the fourth-largest ethnic community, with a section backing the demand for Khalistan.

A dramatic and unprecedented escalation in the year-long rift between India and Canada over the killing of pro-Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in 2023 saw the former recalling high commissioner Sanjay Verma from Ottawa Monday after Canada alleged he and some other Indian diplomats were “persons of interest” in the murder.Several other diplomats and officials were also withdrawn.A Washington Post report said Canada had expelled six diplomats, including Verma, but the Indian side insisted they had been recalled.Late evening, New Delhi said it had expelled six Canadian diplomats, including the deputy high commissioner and charge d’affaires (acting high commissioner) Stewart Wheeler. They were asked to leave India by Oct 19 night.New Delhi summoned Wheeler and told him that the “baseless targeting” of Verma and other diplomats and officials in Canada was “completely unacceptable, and that in an atmosphere of extremism and violence, Trudeau govt’s actions endangered their safety”.We have no faith in the current Canadian govt’s commitment to ensure their (Indian diplomats’) security. Therefore, govt of India has decided to withdraw the high commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials,” New Delhi said, adding it also conveyed that India reserved the right to take further steps in response to the Trudeau govt’s support for extremism, violence and separatism against India.In a scathing and lengthy response to the “ludicrous” allegation, which was conveyed to India in a diplomatic communication on Sunday, Indian govt accused Canada of “pandering to the anti-India separatist agenda” and threatened action against the Canadian mission here for serving the “political agenda” of the Trudeau govt.The escalation by Canada followed a meeting last week between Trudeau and PM Narendra Modi in Laos after which the Canadian PM had said there were real issues between the two countries that needed to be addressed. Indian govt sources had responded by saying that there was no substantive engagement between the two and that bilateral ties could only be repaired if Canada took verifiable action against Khalistani separatists .Earlier in the day, acknowledging a diplomatic communication from Canada claiming that Verma and other diplomats were persons of interest in “a matter related to an investigation” in that country, India strongly rejected the “preposterous” imputations and ascribed them to Trudeau’s vote bank politics.While reiterating that the Canadian govt had not shared a shred of evidence to back Trudeau’s allegations last year about Indian involvement in the Nijjar case, govt said the latest assertions, which followed several rounds of exchanges between the two sides, were also not backed by facts. The intelligence community in both countries had remained in touch about the Nijjar probe but, according to Indian authorities, to no avail as Canada didn’t share any evidence.“This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains. Prime Minister Trudeau’s hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort,” the Indian govt said.“His cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in Dec 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard,” it added, while recalling the Trudeau govt’s support to the farmers’ protests in Delhi in 2020.Taking cognisance of the activities of the Canadian high commission in India that served the “political agenda” of the Trudeau govt, India said this had led to implementation of the principle of reciprocity in regard to diplomatic representation. India had last year forced Canada to withdraw 41 diplomats alleging they were involved in anti-India activities. “India now reserves the right to take further steps in response to these latest efforts of the Canadian govt to concoct allegations against Indian diplomats,” govt said.In its response, India also said that under criticism for turning a blind eye to foreign interference in Canadian politics, the Trudeau govt had deliberately brought in India in an attempt to mitigate the damage.“This latest development targeting Indian diplomats is now the next step in that direction. It is no coincidence that it takes place as Prime Minister Trudeau is to depose before a commission on foreign interference,” govt said, adding the latest allegations also served the anti-India separatist agenda that the Trudeau govt has constantly pandered to for narrow political gains.“To that end, the Trudeau govt has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada,” the govt said.Linked Images (2)","India recalls high commissioner Sanjay Verma from Ottawa.

NEW DELHI: India on Monday hit back at Canada after receiving diplomatic communication suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are 'persons of interest' in a matter related to an investigation in that country.The ministry of external affairs ( MEA ) called the allegations baseless and politically motivated, attributing them to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's domestic agenda and adding that his ""hostility towards India"" has long been in evidence.""The government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Trudeau government that is centred around vote bank politics ,"" the MEA said in a statement.""Prime Minister Trudeau’s hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard. That his Government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters,"" it added.The MEA reffered to past events as a reminder of the strained ties between the two nations, worsened by what India sees as Trudeau's repeated interference in its internal affairs.The MEA accused Trudeau’s government of relying on support from political parties that openly back separatism in India. “That his government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters,” the statement read.The accusation from Canada comes at a time when Trudeau’s government is facing domestic scrutiny over foreign interference in its own political system. MEA alleged that Trudeau’s latest move against Indian diplomats is part of an effort to deflect attention from those allegations.“Under criticism for turning a blind eye to foreign interference in Canadian politics, his Government has deliberately brought in India in an attempt to mitigate the damage. This latest development targeting Indian diplomats is now the next step in that direction. It is no coincidence that it takes place as Prime Minister Trudeau is to depose before a commission on foreign interference. It also serves the anti-India separatist agenda that the Trudeau Government has constantly pandered to for narrow political gains,” the MEA said in the statement.The ministry said that it has taken note of activities within the Canadian high commission in New Delhi that it says serve the political interests of Trudeau's government. ""The government of India has taken cognizance of the activities of the Canadian high commission in India that serve the political agenda of the current regime. This led to the implementation of the principle of reciprocity in regard to diplomatic representation,"" the MEA said.India has also indicated that it reserves the right to take further steps in response to what it calls ""concocted"" allegations against its diplomats.India-Canada relations were severely strained after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged Indian government’s involvement in the death of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whom India had designated as a terrorist. Nijjar was fatally shot in June outside a Gurudwara in Surrey, Canada. Dismissing Trudeau's claims as ‘absurd and motivated’ , the Indian government refuted the allegations made by Trudeau in the House of Commons. Subsequently, Canada's expulsion of India's diplomat prompted the ministry of external affairs to summon the Canadian envoy and expel a senior Canadian diplomat.","India says it has received diplomatic communication suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are 'persons of interest' in a matter related to an investigation in Canada.

NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting, well in time for a welcome dinner that will be hosted by Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif for the delegates.While both sides have ruled out any formal bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SCO event, the minister as of now is expected to participate in the dinner and exchange pleasantries with host Shehbaz and counterpart Ishaq Dar, before the main summit on Wednesday.Even though it won’t be a fleeting visit as was previously thought, Jaishankar will likely spend not more than 24 hours in Pakistan before flying back to India.The minister will be in Pakistan on October 15-16 for what will be the first visit by any Indian foreign minister to the country in nearly a decade. However, a day after India confirmed his visit to Pakistan, Jaishankar said he wasn’t going to Islamabad to discuss India’s ties with Pakistan but to be a ``good member’’ of the SCO, which counts India and Pakistan apart from Russia, China, Iran and 4 Central Asian countries as member-states.India hasn’t allowed its differences with Pakistan on the issue of cross-border terrorism , or even the border tensions with China, to come in the way of its participation in the Eurasian bloc that is seen as playing an important role in ensuring regional security. Russia’s presence in the group has also been a motivating factor for India.While a structured bilateral meeting is ruled out, a quick pull aside, possibly behind the scenes, on the margins could still take place but India will expect Islamabad to propose any such meeting. India has continued to maintain that the onus for any forward movement in the relationship, which has not seen any substantive engagement between the 2 countries for the past 9 years, is on Pakistan. For any rapprochement, India sees as essential verifiable and irreversible action by Pakistan against terrorism, and also a review of its decision to downgrade ties after the Indian government revoked the special status of J&K.Pakistan, however, has remained focused on the issue of Kashmir with Dar saying Sunday Islamabad under Shehbaz hasn’t lost an opportunity to raise it along with the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza.Chinese Premier Li Qiang will also be present at the event but there’s no confirmation yet of any bilateral meeting between him and Jaishankar.In his SCO address, Jaishankar is expected to underscore India’s concerns about terrorism, the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity while undertaking connectivity and infrastructure initiatives and also to take up concerns of the Global South. The SCO Charter doesn’t allow any member-state to raise bilateral issues and it’s unlikely he will name Pakistan. The minister will represent PM Narendra Modi who had been invited by Shehbaz to participate in the meeting. However, Modi only participates in the heads of state summit and normally deputes the foreign minister to stand in for him at the heads of government meetings.",India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to land in Pakistan on Tuesday evening for the SCO heads of government meeting.

'Where will the dogs go...': Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran recalls his memorable moments with Ratan Tata in heartfelt post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/where-will-the-dogs-go-tata-sons-chairman-n-chandrasekaran-recalls-his-memorable-moments-with-ratan-tata-in-heartfelt-post/articleshow/114206597.cms,"N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons has shared heartfelt reflections on the life and legacy of Ratan Tata. (Image source: N Chandrasekaran LinkedIn)

Below is the full text of N Chandrasekaran’s LinkedIn post:

Anybody who met Mr. Tata came away with a story about his humanity, warmth, and dreams for India. There really was no one like him.

Our relationship grew over the years, first focusing on business and eventually evolving into a more personal connection. We discussed interests ranging from cars to hotels, but when our conversations turned to other matters—those of daily life—he would show how much he noticed and felt. He was someone to be discovered, over time and through experience.

I remember several such instances.

Just after I became Chairman, I was introduced to a situation within Tata Motors which involved a dispute between the company and the employees’ union over wages for two years. In March ‘17, Mr. Tata and I met the union leaders together. During the meeting, Mr. Tata relayed three messages: he regretted the delay in finding a resolution. He explained that the company was passing through hardship. And both of us committed that this dispute would be concluded within a fortnight.

Mr. Tata’s direction squarely focused on making sure employees were well taken care of—not just to resolve the dispute, but to ensure their and their families’ well-being. Across other Group companies, his perspective on employees was uniform. It is something that has shaped a number of our leaders across the Group.

Around that same time, I expressed a desire to renovate our headquarters, Bombay House. Bombay House had not been touched since 1924, and more important (as many people told me) Mr. Tata would not like it. “Bombay House is a temple,” I was told, emphasising its sanctity.

When I finally mentioned to Mr. Tata about Bombay House, he said, “May I ask you something? When you say ‘renovate’, do you mean ‘vacate’?”

I explained that we planned to move everyone to a nearby office.

He gently clarified: “Where will the dogs go?”

The dogs were an integral part of Bombay House, often seen at the reception.

“We will build a kennel.”

“Really?” he said, considering it.

When the renovation of Bombay House was complete, Mr. Tata wanted to see the kennel first.

He was very happy to see how thoughtful the kennel’s design was, and how well the dogs would be cared for.

Seeing his happiness with the kennel and his priorities was a reminder that while big projects are important, it’s the details that reveal how we think, what we prioritise, and how we are perceived. His joy was confirmation that we had done the right thing.

If Mr. Tata ever visited a place, he could recall everything—from the placement of smallest piece of furniture, the lighting, colours, and so on. His memory was photographic. He remembered the covers and content of books and magazines and referred to them even years later. He was always observing and processing, from large ideas to minute detail.

There is so much else to say about who he was, but for now, as I process his absence, this will have to do: His eye received everything clearly, as his mind perceived everything clearly.","N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons has shared heartfelt reflections on the life and legacy of Ratan Tata.

Star Health , the largest health insurer in the country, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company has now revealed that the hacker responsible for the leak demanded a $68,000 (nearly 57.21 lakhs) ransom in August. The company noted that ""the threat actor demanded a ransom of $68,000 in an email"" addressed to its managing director and chief executive.The breach, which was first reported in September, has led to a reputational and business crisis for the company. Star Health’s shares have since declined by 11%. The company launched internal investigations and has also taken legal action against the messaging app Telegram and the hacker. The report claims that the hacker’s website continues to share samples of Star customers' data.This statement comes after stock exchanges asked Star Health for clarification over another Reuters report which claimed that the company was investigating allegations about its chief security officer being involved in the data leak.Later on, the company announced that it had found no wrongdoing by the official, Amarjeet Khanuja. However, the internal investigation stays open.The hacker exploited Telegram chatbots and a dedicated website to disseminate the stolen data and continues to share samples of customer information. In response to the breach, Star Health launched internal investigations and initiated legal action against Telegram and the hacker. The company is also collaborating with Indian cyber security authorities to address the situation.Despite receiving multiple notices from the insurance company, Telegram has refused to share information about the hacker's accounts or permanently ban them from the platform, Star Health said. The company also identified the hacker as ""xenZen"" in their latest statement.However, earlier, the Dubai-based messenger app said that it removed the chatbots as soon as it was flagged to the platform.","Star Health, India's largest health insurer, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details.

How China is lessening its reliance on helium sourced from US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/how-china-is-lessening-its-reliance-on-helium-sourced-from-us/articleshow/114226173.cms,"In recent years, China has quietly worked to lessen its reliance on helium sourced from the US, a rare and strategically important resource used extensively in industries like healthcare, semiconductors, and quantum computing.This effort has included a range of actions, such as diversifying its international supply sources and boosting domestic production through advancements in science and technology.The strategy appears to be working, according to experts.China used to depend on the US for most of its helium. “If China faces a shortage of helium, the impact on technology would be significant because, in many areas, helium is hard to replace,” said Jost Wuebbeke , managing partner of Sinolytics, a research-based consultancy with offices in Berlin and Beijing.But now, if the US attempts to use helium as leverage in a tech war with China, the potential impact would be “marginal”, said Wuebbeke , whose research focuses on China’s economy and industrial policy.Today the US accounts for less than 5 per cent of China’s helium imports, while Qatar accounts for almost 90 per cent, with an increasing amount of helium also coming from Russia, which is expanding its capacity, he said.The US could restrict Qatar’s access to helium extraction technology as a way of sanctioning China, but “the political costs of damaging relations with Qatar would be greater than the benefits for Washington”, Wuebbeke said.From a supply availability perspective, while the US supplies a little less than half of the world’s helium, there are other major suppliers, notably Russia, which will become the world’s third major supplier when the Amur project – launched by Russia’s largest natural gas company – reaches full capacity in a few years, according to Phil Kornbluth , president of US-based Kornbluth Helium Consulting, which has ties to some Chinese clients, wrote SCMP.As societies become more technology-driven, demand for the valuable gas is soaring.Helium can be chilled to near absolute zero, making it essential for cooling cutting-edge equipment such as quantum computers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, fusion reactors and particle accelerators.Helium is also extremely stable, making it useful in the manufacture of sensitive products such as computer chips and laser light.Driven by rapid growth in the semiconductor industry, among others, China has become the world’s second-largest user of helium; consumption grew by 7.2 per cent between 2020 and 2023.Helium is a by-product of natural gas production, and while China has natural gas, it contains only trace amounts of helium, making direct extraction too expensive for mass production, wrote SCMP.In an article published in late 2022 in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science, several researchers from PetroChina’s Beijing-based Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development stressed that once the US imposed a “stranglehold” blockade on helium exports to China, the country’s helium supply would be “greatly restricted”.The US has a global monopoly on helium reserves and the most advanced helium extraction technology, they added.But the dynamics have shifted significantly. Last month, achievements in helium extraction and related equipment development were nominated for an annual scientific award by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).These scientific and engineering accomplishments “break the long-standing monopoly of the US and ensure the security of China’s helium resources”, according to the nomination document.In an interview last year with Liaowang, a publication under the state news agency Xinhua, Zhang Suojiang , director of the Institute of Process Engineering, which is also under the CAS, said that to address the low grade and extraction challenges of China’s helium reserves, his institute developed helium separation membrane materials and components, which have shown excellent performance in trials.In 2020, China opened its first large-scale helium plant capable of producing the material at a commercial scale.The Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry under the CAS, which backed the project, said it had successfully extracted helium from natural gas at the plant, located in China’s northwest.China has achieved other significant breakthroughs, particularly in extracting helium from coal bed methane. In 2021, a joint project led by the China Coal Research Institute began, and within two years, the team announced they had successfully overcome the technical challenges and mastered the extraction process.In 2023, China commissioned the world’s first high-purity helium extraction plant from coal bed methane, paving a new path to increase domestic helium production.Meanwhile, scientists are also exploring alternatives to helium for achieving the ultra-low temperatures required in advanced industries. For instance, an international research team, which included physicists from a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) institute, discovered a cobalt-based quantum magnetic material that could theoretically generate ultra-low temperatures without the need for helium. Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature in January.An article published in February by the China National Chemical Information Centre (CNCIC), a prominent consulting firm in the petroleum and chemical sectors, noted that China’s pure helium production capacity remained relatively low until 2020.However, between 2020 and 2023, the country experienced a significant increase in production capacity, driven by advancements in helium extraction technology.Despite these efforts, Wuebbeke pointed out that China’s push to expand domestic capacity has had limited impact so far. While helium production grew fivefold between 2018 and 2022, 92 per cent of the helium consumed in China was still imported.CNCIC projected that by 2028, China would still depend on imports for around 60 per cent of its helium supply. Nonetheless, the organization emphasized that China’s growing domestic production could serve as a valuable bargaining tool, helping to prevent foreign suppliers from arbitrarily raising prices or cutting off supplies, wrote SCMP.","China used to depend on the US for most of its helium. Today the US accounts for less than 5 per cent of China’s helium imports. Qatar accounts for almost 90 per cent, with an increasing amount of helium also coming from Russia, which is expanding its capacity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114226210,imgsize-16714,width-400,resizemode-4/114226210.jpg"

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Royal Family: King Charles pauses cancer treatment for Australian tour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-pauses-cancer-treatment-for-australian-tour/articleshow/114232165.cms,"King Charles (Picture Credit: Reuters)

King Charles has decided to temporarily pause his cancer treatment as he and Queen Camilla prepare for an 11-day tour of Australia. The 75-year-old monarch has been receiving regular treatment for most of the year, making him the first British king to publicly battle such a serious illness while still on the throne.According to sources, the King’s doctors have cleared him for the tour, but his schedule has been significantly reduced to accommodate rest days, as the New York Post reported.The decision to move forward with the visit reflects the King’s determination to maintain his duties, even as his health visibly deteriorates.Reports indicate that King Charles has lost a considerable amount of weight and looks aged noticeably since he was diagnosed back in February.Yet, the upcoming tour is seen as essential for preserving ties with Australia, one of the 14 realms still recognizing the British monarch as head of state.With republican sentiments growing in the Australian region, the King’s presence is seen as critical to reinforcing these connections.Meanwhile, there are signs of a power shift within the royal family . Prince William and Princess Kate have been increasingly stepping into the spotlight.Last month, Kate shared a video celebrating the end of her chemotherapy, notably excluding any mention of King Charles.Analysts suggest this move, which was not approved by the King, reflects a growing independence for the Waleses.As Charles continues his battle with cancer, questions arise over how much longer he can maintain his role as monarch, especially with Prince William gradually assuming more influence.","King Charles has decided to temporarily pause his cancer treatment as he and Queen Camilla prepare for an 11-day tour of Australia.
