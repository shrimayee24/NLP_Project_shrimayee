Government approves shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on Delhi-Jaipur NH to Pachgaon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-approves-shifting-of-gurgaons-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-on-delhi-jaipur-nh-to-pachgaon/articleshow/121702665.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government has approved shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Jaipur National Highway (NH-48) to Pachgaon, a place beyond Manesar, paving the way for easy commute for lakhs of office goers.When the plaza is moved to Pachgaon, over 15 kilometres from Gurgaon, commuters travelling between Delhi and Manesar also won’t have to pay toll. Locals have been demanding its removal since 2014.TOI has learnt that Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has approved the plan, and to ensure the new spot doesn’t see any congestion, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will go for Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) toll collection system. For the new facility, the Haryana government has provided nearly 28 acres of land to the highway authority, sources said.The process of shifting and starting the MMLF system to collect toll at Pachgaon may take around six months. “Pachgaon is the ideal location as it falls beyond Gurgaon and Manesar. Since there is an interchange of the Western Peripheral Expressway and the NH-48 at Pachgaon, the new toll collection point couldn’t have been beyond the intersection,” a source said.In the MMLF system, vehicles don’t need to stop as overhead cameras installed for each lane will read the vehicle registration number and automatically deduct the charge from the FASTag wallet linked to the vehicle.Sources said a decision has also been taken to have an integrated system to ensure that traffic coming from the Dwarka Expressway side and heading towards Jaipur don’t end up paying toll at this point once again as user fee. “This is very much possible. Once the annual toll pass for private vehicles is rolled out most of the issues will be resolved automatically,” said a source.The shifting of the toll plaza will end conflicts between operators and people from areas adjoining Kherki Daula, and fulfil the promise the Haryana and central governments have been making for the past seven to eight years.Locals have been demanding that the NHAI shift the toll plaza citing that the govt has recovered more than the investment made in constructing the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway by private players and the highway authority.In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha in March, the road transport ministry said against Rs 2,489 crore incurred as cost for the NH-48’s Delhi-Gurgaon stretch, the toll collection has been around Rs 2,775 crore, around 11% more than the investment.After completion of this 27-km Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, commuters were paying user fees at Sirhaul (Delhi-Gurgaon border) and Kherki Daula toll plazas. Tolling was stopped at the Delhi-Gurgaon border in 2014, bringing relief to commuters travelling between Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and Kherki Daula. However, those going beyond this point paid toll for the entire stretch. At present, NHAI collects toll through its agency.Meanwhile, sources said the decision to shift the Kherki Daula toll plaza by the road transport ministry will create more pressure on the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to do away with physical entry fee collection booths on the capital’s borders to prevent congestion. Traffic jams at these places defeat the purpose of huge investment in building highways and expressways for faster connectivity to Delhi.","The government has approved shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Jaipur National Highway (NH-48) To ensure the new spot doesn’t see any congestion, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will go for Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) toll collection system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121702670,imgsize-1905676,width-400,resizemode-4/121702670.jpg"

Viral Dubai chocolate gets desi spin. India can’t get knafeh of it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/viral-dubai-chocolate-gets-desi-spin-india-cant-get-knafeh-of-it/articleshow/121697009.cms,"Kochi-based Paul And Mike were one of the first to launch their own take

Sometimes, a global trend finds its sweetest home far from where it began. Ashmeet Singh Dua didn’t think a viral chocolate bar with a pistachio filling from Dubai would define his five-year-old Hyderabad-based dessert brand but the kunafa pistachio chocolate bar he introduced in Sept last year did just that. “It’s become our brand identity. In Hyderabad, people already love kunafa, so this was a hit the moment we launched it,” says the chef and founder of Xocolatl.If you haven’t heard of Dubai chocolate, you probably don’t have a sweet tooth. Inspired by the traditional Middle Eastern dessert knafeh (also called kunafa), it’s become such a craze that global pistachio prices started climbing and every chocolate brand launched its own versions. Indian brands too have put their spin on it.Dua’s take on the bar uses imported kataifi pastry for the crunch, house-roasted pistachio paste and a creamy filling. He’s got a range of flavours as well: nutella, lotus biscoff, salted caramel. “We’ve had celebrities try it and it’s our best-selling product even today. Unlike other dessert fads, this one’s here to stay,” he says.At Manam Chocolate, the award-winning craft chocolate brand from Hyderabad, the Dubai chocolate bar gets a layered, decadent spin.Called ‘The Kunafa Stack’, it brings together their house-made custard, tart bursts of fresh mulberries, pistachio cake crumbs with toasted granola and chopped dates. It’s topped with crisp pistachio kataifi and a scoop of house-made gelato, and a final flourish comes with a warm pour of molten Manam chocolate.Ruby Islam, head chef at Manam Chocolate, says The Kunafa Stack was launched during Ramzan this year. “I always look forward to creating unique experiences. But it’s also important to hear what people are asking for. When the Dubai Kunafa chocolate went viral, people started asking us if we had something with crunchy pistachio and milk chocolate.” The brand is opening a New Delhi outlet this month, where this version will be available.Mumbai’s French pastry shop Le15 Patisserie has also tapped into the Dubai chocolate trend. Founder Pooja Dhingra, aka the macaron queen, tried the famed bar in Dubai earlier this year and immediately understood the hype. “It was bold, sweet, crunchy and satisfying. But I knew I wanted to reimagine it through the lens of French pastry. A tart felt like the perfect format,” says Dhingra. Her kunafa chocolate pistachio tart, launched last month, features a buttery chocolate tart shell filled with pistachio cream, toasted kunafa and dark chocolate ganache topped with a pistachio macaron. Dhingra admits that viral trends come with their own set of expectations. “Trends push you to stay current and experiment, which is fun and keeps the creative energy high. But there is a pressure to constantly be ‘new’ and sometimes, that can feel more reactive than intentional,” she says.Kochi-based Paul And Mike’s bar has a golden kataifi pastry and a pistachio-rich filling. Founder and business head Vikas Temani says openness to global trends isn’t just philosophy — it’s now an operational reality. “What virality has done is really compress the product innovation cycle. We wanted to be the first among reputed Indian chocolate brands to launch this, so we did it real quick in terms of R&D and sourcing. That also gave us a window of no competition,” he says.As kataifi pastry is hard to find, home bakers in India have substituted the ingredients with what’s locally available. Some have used roasted sevaiya noodles to recreate that signature crunch. Arun Viswanathan of Chitra’m Craft Chocolates in Coimbatore didn’t want to replicate the trending Kunafa chocolate. Instead, he used a base of nool peni — a South Indian festive sweet made with fine strands of deep-fried dough, resembling delicate vermicelli, layered with ghee and powdered sugar — and cheekily named his bar Dubai Return, almost saying we’ve been there and come back with something of our own. The nool peni is layered with pistachio, saffron, rose and a touch of gulkand (rose petal preserve). “Nool peni has a flaky, crisp texture that reminds me of kunafa. So, I thought, why not reimagine the Dubai bar with it? Our Dubai Return is familiar, yet it surprises you,” says Viswanathan, who did his chocolate training in Belgium.Poetry by Love and Cheesecake, a cafe chain in Delhi, gave the trend a seasonal spin last month with their Chocolate Mango Kunafa Cheesecake. “We’ve never done anything like this before,” says chef Amit Sharma. “But after the Dubai chocolate went viral, people got curious—now we’re seeing repeat orders and planning more Kunafa experiments.”","Dubai chocolate, inspired by Middle Eastern dessert knafeh (also called kunafa), has become a global craze. Every chocolate brand in India has launched its own version of the chocolate bar.

Other G7 members keen on seeing Modi's participation, hints Carney

NEW DELHI: Canadian PM Mark Carney defended the last-minute invitation to his counterpart Narendra Modi for the G7 summit , saying it made sense for Canada and other members to invite the ""5th largest economy"" and the most populous country in the world that's central to a number of supply chains.While Modi's travel programme is not finalised yet, he's expected to reach Alberta in time for the G7 outreach session on June 17.The G7 summit begins on June 15. Asked repeatedly about why Canada would have Modi over when the probe into the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar is still on, Canadian PM Mark Carney said there had been progress on law enforcement dialogue which ""recognises issues of accountability"".Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau had wrecked the India-Canada relationship by alleging the Indian govt's role in the murder without, as India continues to maintain, sharing any evidence. ""Bilaterally, we have now agreed-importantly-to continued law enforcement dialogue. So, there's been some progress on that, which recognises issues of accountability. I extended the invitation to Prime Minister Modi in that context, and he has accepted,'' said Carney, responding to questions from the media about the issue and the invitation to Modi.""We are a country of the rule of law. The rule of law is proceeding as it should in Canada, and I am not going to disrupt that process,'' he added.Carney hinted that other G7 members were keen on seeing participation by the Indian leader. ""First, we are in the role - Canada is in the role - of the G7 chair, and in those discussions, as agreed with our G7 colleagues, we're addressing important issues like energy security, the digital future, and critical minerals, among others. Partnerships in building infrastructure in the emerging and developing world are also part of the agenda,'' he said. ""In my capacity as G7 chair, and in consultation with others - some of whom also make these determinations - it makes sense to include India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, effectively the most populous country, and central to a number of those supply chains,'' he added.","Canadian PM Mark Carney defended the last-minute invitation to his counterpart Narendra Modi for the G7 summit.

HYDERABAD: In a major breakthrough, Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's (TGANB) investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat, from which it seized Rs 50 lakh a few days ago.TGANB director Sandeep Shandilya, said the money, collected over just two days, was moments away from being laundered to Nigeria. ""Had we delayed the raid by an hour, the entire amount would have been transferred. It was neatly stashed inside the washing machine, ready for dispatch,"" he said.Following a month-long surveillance operation in Goa, TGANB --- assisted by Goa police --- zeroed in on hawala transactions being conducted from Sangeetha Mobile Shop in Mapusa and an apartment in Goa's Highland Park.The key accused, Uttam Singh, who runs the mobile shop, was arrested. Investigators revealed he had laundered Rs 2.1 crore of drug proceeds in just one week.""Drug money collected in cash was handed over to Uttam, often by foreign nationals. He then moved the funds to Mumbai through informal channels, and from there, it was transferred to Nigeria,"" Shandilya explained. The investigation into the hawala trail started after Nigerian national Emmanuel Bediako, alias Maxwell, revealed it to TGANB.Between May 26 and June 1, officials tracked 58 hawala transactions involving Rs 2.1 crore. A few days after establishing this link, a raid on Highland Park apartment led to the recovery of Rs 50 lakh in cash. Over the past month, four Nigerian nationals have been arrested during TGANB operations in Goa.Authorities believe Uttam is one of several hawala operators facilitating cross-border drug money transfers. Police officials suspect a wider network of hawala operators is active, working hand-in-glove with international narcotics cartels.","Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat.

"Despite World Bank raising threshold, India achieves big dip in extreme poverty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-world-bank-raising-threshold-india-achieves-big-dip-in-extreme-poverty/articleshow/121700912.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade after the World Bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data in its June upgrade of the methodology.Based on the update, the latest World Bank data showed that the extreme poverty rate had declined from 27.1% in 2011-12 to 5.3% in 2022-23. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.In a blog, the World Bank said that the international poverty line for low-income countries has been raised to $3 per person per day from the existing $2.15 per person per day, and for lower middle-income countries it's changed from $3.65 to $4.20 per day and for upper middle-income countries it went up from $6.85 to $8.40.Given India's inflation rate, between 2017 and 2021, a revised extreme poverty line of $3 would constitute a 15% higher threshold than $2.15 expressed in 2021 prices and result in a 5.3% poverty rate in 2022-23. A new LMIC line of $4.20 would imply a 5% lower threshold for poverty than $3.65 adjusted in 2021 prices and yield a poverty rate of 23.9%, according to the World Bank.Using the new poverty line for low middle income countries (LMIC), which is at $4.20 per day per person, India's poverty rate fell to 23.9% in 2022-23 from 57.7% in 2011-12.The number of people in extreme poverty was down from 732.48 million in 2011-12 to 342.32 million in 2022-23, according to the data available on the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform.Free and subsidised food transfers supported poverty reduction, and the rural-urban poverty gap narrowed. The five most populous states account for 54% of the extremely poor, it had said.According to the poverty and equity brief published by World Bank in April, extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) fell from 16.2% in 2011- 12 to 2.3% in 2022-23, lifting 171 million people above this line. Rural extreme poverty dropped from 18.4% to 2.8% , and urban from 10.7% to 1.1% , narrowing the rural-urban gap from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points-a 16% annual decline.The poverty report had also said India has transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the $3.65 per day LMIC poverty line, poverty fell from 61.8% to 28.1%, lifting 378 million people out of poverty. Rural poverty dropped from 69% to 32.5%, and urban poverty from 43.5% to 17.2%, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points with a 7% annual decline, the April report had said.The updated World Bank data is expected to come as a shot in the arm for the govt and bolster its record of handling the economy and pursuing policies to push inclusive growth and lift millions out of poverty.Last year, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subhramanyam had indicated that the poverty level could be less than 5% based on preliminary estimates on the household consumption expenditure (HCES) data released by the statistics office.World Bank has said that in recent years, the scope and quality of information provided by household surveys has improved enormously, particularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, offering a clearer view into people's welfare and day-to-day lives.Several research papers have also indicated the reduction in extreme poverty over the last decade thanks to robust growth. A survey released last year estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12 and pointed out that chronic poverty has come down but there is a significant proportion of people who can slip back into poverty due to ""accident of life"".World Bank, which introduced the international poverty line (IPL) in 1990, has undertaken several updates to include changing prices and costs, and the latest update was undertaken on June 5.The first update to IPL happened in 2001, with subsequent revisions in 2008, 2015, 2022, and more recently this month. This latest update, which also applies to the poverty lines for middle-income countries, follows the release last year of a new set of PPPs based on prices collected in 2021 by the International Comparison Programme.It also reflects changes in national poverty lines, which is a big reason for the increase, especially for the line that tracks extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.

"Delhi AQI deteriorates again, CAQM reimposes Stage-I GRAP measures across NCR",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-aqi-deteriorates-again-caqm-reimposes-stage-i-grap-measures-across-ncr/articleshow/121696929.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: In response to a renewed spike in pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has reimposed Stage-I measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect.The decision was announced in an official order on Saturday, after Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) climbed to 209, placing it in the ‘Poor’ category.As per the CAQM order, the Sub-Committee reviewed air quality data and forecasts from the IMD and IITM and observed a steady deterioration. “The AQI of Delhi has shown an increasing trend and has been recorded at 209 on 07.06.2025. Further, the forecast also predicts AQI to mainly remain in ‘Poor’ category in coming days,” the order stated.In light of this, the Sub-Committee has directed all agencies in NCR to invoke Stage-I actions of the extant GRAP with “immediate effect”. These include stricter monitoring of air quality levels and enhanced dust mitigation efforts, especially in Delhi-NCR. Citizens may also be urged to follow the citizen charter under Stage-I.Stage-I GRAP measures aim to prevent further air quality degradation through targeted interventions.These include enforcing dust control protocols at construction sites, promoting public transport, and regulating open waste burning.The decision comes just three weeks after Stage-I measures were revoked on May 18, when Delhi's AQI had improved to 179 and settled into the ‘Moderate’ category. The CAQM had then observed that dust pollution caused by episodic strong winds and thunderstorms had subsided, leading to better air quality.However, with levels climbing again, dust control has once more become a key focus. In May, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) made it mandatory for all construction and demolition sites to register on its Dust Portal before plan approvals.To further strengthen action, the Delhi government, in coordination with DSIIDC, has already begun deploying GPS-enabled hydraulic anti-smog gun vehicles, each capable of spraying mist up to 30 metres. These CNG-powered vehicles are operational in two shifts across industrial zones like Bawana and Narela.Reiterating the government’s dual commitment to development and environment, Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said last month, “We are taking concrete steps to minimise industrial waste and improve infrastructure so that businesses can thrive responsibly.”The CAQM has assured that it will keep a close watch on pollution levels and reassess the situation for further action based on IMD forecasts and real-time air quality data.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has reimposed Stage-I measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR.

1st passenger train to Srinagar on Saturday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-passenger-train-to-srinagar-on-saturday/articleshow/121659886.cms,"LUCKNOW: Neetu Sapra has bittersweet memories of the 14 years she spent in J&K since 1997.""No quarters, peak insurgency, Kargil War - it was a roller coaster,"" she says of life in a CRPF camp in Srinagar with a two-year-old son and a railway officer husband handling a project as fraught with danger as it was technically daunting. ""On a shopping trip to Lal Chowk in 1998, we narrowly escaped a bomb blast. The USBRL shaped us as much as we shaped it.""Neetu's story is intertwined with the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) that PM Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate Friday, marking the physical bridging of what was once considered a geographical implausibility: seamless rail connectivity from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.""Wives of all railway personnel associated with USBRL would have similar stories to tell,"" says Neetu, whose husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.Sapra was posted in Udhampur when former PM H D Deve Gowda laid USBRL's foundation stone in Udhampur in early 1997. Many thought the task of carving a route through the undulating, terrorist-infested terrain was a fanciful idea.By April that year, India had a new PM in I K Gujral, and a second foundation ceremony was soon planned in Srinagar for the Qazigund-Baramulla section.Sapra recalls receiving an official note from his senior colleague Sandeep Gupta - the executive engineer assigned to lead the 13-strong technical team - to proceed to Srinagar for the July 12, 1997, event.With the odds as steep as the Pir Panjal, the team got cracking. ""Srinagar was synonymous with militancy. Nobody was prepared,"" Gupta, who retired as USBRL's chief administrative officer in Feb this year, writes in the 2009 TOI coffee table book, 'Linking Paradise: A Northern Railway Project'.""We had no choice but to dive in. This was bigger than us,"" he writes in the book, remembering how his team got by erratic phone and electricity connections and an inadequate number of vehicles.Sapra's trip to Srinagar from Udhampur to lay the ground for the foundation ceremony prepared him for what lay ahead.""Just 13km beyond Udhampur, we dodged the possibility of death by a few metres as a landslide occurred in front of our eyes. The national highway was blocked for 48 hours."" A week later, Gupta joined them, reaching Srinagar on a rickety van. A team from CRPF's 69th battalion was then occupying the railway-owned holiday home in Srinagar's Tulsi Bagh, leaving Gupta's team to cram into four dingy rooms within the complex.""We had only candles for light and hauled water in buckets from CRPF tankers,"" says Sapra, currently principal executive director in the Research Design and Standards Organisation in Lucknow.Living conditions and logistics remained a challenge throughout. The state power department refused to restore electricity to the railway facility, citing unpaid bills throughout a decade of unrest. It took several meetings with the then divisional commissioner of Kashmir, SL Bhat, for power supply to be restored. Mudassara, the PA to DoT's then general manager, intervened to provide landlines.On Nov 12, 1997, a railway survey team comprising two officers, three junior engineers and six helpers reached Nowgam (later named Srinagar railway station) on a cloudy, uneasy morning. Locals mistook them for a police raid party, causing an already tense situation to almost spiral out of control.""I had butterflies in my stomach due to sheer anxiety and fear,"" Gupta recalls in his essay.Every day, a road-opening party would set out ahead of the railway survey team to detect and defuse potential mines. After spending weeks studying topography sheets and working out other details, Gupta and Sapra drove the first two wooden pegs into the ground to mark the project's first alignment.""It felt like we had planted a dream,"" recalls Sapra.As winter took hold, the survey covered Pampore and Kakapora. The first snowfall of 1997 came on Nov 27. Work had to be halted by Dec 15. The team would return next April to resume work.""On our off days, we hunted for vegetarian food in Srinagar. However, the CRPF wasn't happy about our venturing out of the railways complex,"" reminisces Gupta.While surveying Anantnag, the team would run into surrendered militants still carrying AK-47s. ""They looked intimidating, but didn't do us harm; in fact, they seemed encouraging,"" says Gupta.By Oct 31, 1998, the Qazigund-Baramulla survey report was ready. The railway team didn't just beat the odds; they completed the task ahead of schedule.After the Baramulla-Qazigund section, Sapra and his colleagues were asked to survey the proposed Katra-Qazigund stretch. That was in 2001. The then rail minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation for this portion two years later.""During the survey, we closely observed how difficult life was for people of the Valley. Pregnant women, critically ill patients and elderly people would be brought down from hilly terrain on makeshift palanquins as there were no roads. Mules and horses were the only modes of transport to ferry goods,"" recalls Sapra.Just when things seemed to be going well, tragedy struck on June 25, 2004, when IRCON engineer R N Pundhir and his brother were kidnapped and killed by terrorists at Sugan in Shopian. ""It was a jolt. Work paused. But buoyed by local sympathy and police support, the railway men restarted with the same zeal,"" writes Bhanu Prakash, the then deputy chief engineer of USBRL, in his memoir.The first trial run in Oct 2008, from Budgam to Kakapora, was a milestone in more ways than one. A Hindu priest, a Muslim cleric and a Sikh granthi presided over prayers before the train rolled in at 30kmph. ""Locals lined the tracks and children skipped school to see the trial run. Even the cattle seemed puzzled!"" recounts Bhanu.By the time the Qazigund-Baramulla section was commissioned in 2009, tracks were ready for trains to run at speeds of up to 100kmph.Built at a cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, including a parallel highway, the 272km rail route has 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, including the world's highest, the Chenab Bridge.The rail route promises all-weather connectivity, slashing the 800km Delhi-Srinagar journey to under 13 hours.This isn't just a story of steel tracks, concrete arches and staggering statistics. USBRL is an odyssey of workers and officials fighting the elements, braving the threat of guns, and enduring separation from their families to finally ""connect"" Kashmir to the rest of India.",The Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) will be inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi on Friday.

NEW DELHI: French aerospace major Dassault Aviation has tied up with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) to manufacture fuselage of Rafale fighters at Hyderabad, as part of the overall Rs 63,887 crore (almost ₹7 billion) deal inked by India in April to acquire 26 maritime variants of the omni-role jets.The inter-governmental deal, under which the 26 Rafale-M jets will be delivered in the 2028-2030 timeframe, had included the setting up of a production facility for fuselages as well as MRO facilities for aircraft engines, sensors and weapons in India.With the IAF first inducting 36 Rafales for Rs 59,000 crore and then the 26 Rafale-M jets for the Navy, the French fighter is the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Under the four production transfer agreements between Dassault Aviation and TASL, the Hyderabad facility will manufacture ""key structural sections"" of the Rafale, including the lateral shells of the rear fuselage, the complete rear section, the central fuselage, and the front section for India and global markets.""The first fuselage sections are expected to roll out in FY 2028, with the facility expected to deliver up to two complete fuselages per month,"" a joint Dassault-TASL statement said on Thursday.""For the first time, Rafale fuselages will be produced outside France.

'Defiant' NATO Nation Leader Boldly Speaks Russian In Parliament; 'Nobody Can Stop Us...' | Viral





FBI Director Kash Patel has claimed that the United States is working closely with Indian law enforcement agencies to dismantle what he describes as a China-backed global fentanyl trafficking network. Speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Patel alleged that while India is not a consumer of fentanyl, it has become an increasingly critical transit point for chemical precursors manufactured in China and passed on to Mexican drug cartels.“They’re going to places like India, and I’m also doing operations in India,” Patel said. “They’re having the Mexican cartels now make this fentanyl down in Mexico still.”Patel claimed that Chinese companies were “getting cute” by routing fentanyl precursors through third countries, including India, to evade direct enforcement and scrutiny.According to Patel, one of the clearest signs of a targeted campaign lies in where fentanyl deaths are and aren’t occurring. He said the drug is devastating the United States but has not created comparable crises in countries like India, Australia, or Canada.“You don’t hear fentanyl deaths in India. You don’t really hear fentanyl deaths in England, Australia, New Zealand, or Five Eyes partners in Canada,” he said.Patel suggested that the absence of deaths in those regions indicated that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was selectively deploying the fentanyl supply chain toward the United States for strategic purposes.“The CCP have used it as a directed approach because we are their adversary,” Patel claimed. “Why don’t we go and take out generations of young men and women who might grow up to serve in the United States military, or become a cop, or become a teacher?”Read: How Kash Patel broke every Indian-American stereotype Patel said that he had personally reached out to Indian officials and that joint operations between the FBI and Indian law enforcement were now underway. “I literally just got off the phone with the Indian government,” he said. “I said, I need your help. This stuff’s coming into your country and then they’re moving it from your country because India is not consuming fentanyl.”He stated that the FBI is working on the ground in India with “the heads of their government law enforcement authorities” to identify and shut down Indian companies involved in importing or redistributing Chinese fentanyl precursors.“We’re going to find these companies that buy it and we’re going to shut them down,” Patel said.Patel also laid out a strategy that includes international legal action. “We’re going to sanction them. We’re going to arrest them where we can. We’re going to indict them in America if we can. We’re going to indict them in India if we can.”Patel’s interest in Indian cooperation is not merely geopolitical — it’s personal. Born to Gujarati immigrant parents who fled East Africa, Patel grew up in a working-class immigrant household and has frequently spoken about the influence of his heritage on his national security outlook. His rise from federal public defender to Trump-era White House official and now FBI Director has often been cast by conservative media as a story of Indian-American exceptionalism — one that defies traditional liberal narratives of the diaspora. His critics, however, argue that he has used his identity to shield controversial moves inside the intelligence establishment.Patel said that the fentanyl trafficking network has adapted in response to stricter enforcement at the US-Mexico border. According to him, cartels are now using Canada as a northern entry point for distribution.“They’re flying it into Vancouver,” Patel said. “They’re taking the precursors up to Canada, manufacturing it up there, and doing their global distribution routes from up there because we were being so effective down south.”He further alleged that China’s economic interest in the trade is minimal and that the real motive is geopolitical sabotage.“They’re not making a ton of money off it,” Patel said. “So it’s really just for that purpose.”Patel stated that fentanyl precursors have been detected in Five Eyes countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand — even though the drug itself has not yet been widely deployed in those regions.“The fentanyl itself isn’t being deployed into your country, but it’s there being manufactured,” he said. “The CCP just hasn’t directed it at you yet, and they know that.”He said he has asked allied governments to help dismantle those production networks before they become operational threats.According to Patel, over 74,000 Americans died of synthetic opioid overdoses in 2023 alone, and the fentanyl epidemic should be viewed not only as a public health emergency but as a “tier one national security threat.”Patel argued that India’s cooperation is critical in confronting what he repeatedly characterised as a CCP-directed campaign to destabilise American society.“India is not the problem,” he said. “But if we don’t get ahead of it, it could become one.”While none of Patel’s claims have yet been independently confirmed by Indian or Chinese officials, his remarks suggest a new phase of international cooperation on drug enforcement — one that places India at the centre of a growing geopolitical storm.Note: Kash Patel's statements about India","FBI Director Kash Patel has claimed that the U.S. is working with Indian law enforcement agencies to dismantle what he describes as a China-backed global fentanyl trafficking network.

Eminem vs Meta: Unauthorised use of music

What Meta said on the lawsuit

Grammy-winning rapper Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta accusing it of copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed by Eminem’s music publishing company, Eight Mile Style, accuses Meta of the ""unauthorised storage, reproduction, and exploitation"" of 243 of Eminem's songs across its platforms.As per the court documents seen by People, Eight Mile Style alleges that Meta's in-app features, such as ""Original Audio"" and ""Reels Remix,"" have actively encouraged and allowed users to incorporate Eminem's music into their video content without proper licensing or attribution. The lawsuit further claims that this has led to rapper's songs being used in millions of videos and streamed billions of times, resulting in diminished value of the copyrights and lost profits for the publisher.As reported by People, the lawsuit alleges that Meta has allowed its users to store, reproduce and exploit Eminem’s songs through features like Original Audio and Reels Remix, which enable users to incorporate music into their content without proper attribution or licensing.Eight Mile Style is seeking statutory damages of $150,000 per song, per platform (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), which could accumulate to the total sum exceeding $109 million. The publisher has also requested a jury trial and a permanent injunction to prevent Meta from future unauthorised use of Eminem's music.Meta has not yet issued a public comment directly on the lawsuit. However, a companyspokesperson told People that the company has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and the company has also been negotiating with Eight Mile Style. “Meta has licenses with thousands of partners around the world and an extensive global licensing program for music on its platforms. Meta had been negotiating in good faith with Eight Mile Style, but rather than continue those discussions, Eight Mile Style chose to sue,” said Meta spokesperson.","Eminem has filed a lawsuit of $109 million against Facebook-parent Meta.

Why Tesla has not paid Elon Musk

What’s next for Elon Musk’s pay?

Despite being one of the most influential figures in the tech and automotive industries, Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Musk’s compensation structure has been a subject of debate for years. His 2018 pay package, which was designed to grant him stock options based on Tesla’s performance milestones, was twice struck down in court, leaving him without formal compensation. While Tesla’s valuation has skyrocketed—growing over 2,000% in the past seven years—Musk has not received a paycheck during this period.As mentioned above, Elon Musk’s salary package was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. As part of the agreement his entire compensation was tied to the company’s overall performance and market capitalisation milestones.Under this structure, Musk was granted stock options that would vest only if Tesla hit specific, escalating targets for market capitalisation, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA. Over the years, as Tesla's valuation soared and it met many of these goals, the package became immensely valuable, potentially making it the largest compensation deal in corporate history.The legal battle over Musk’s $56 billion stock award has prevented Tesla from issuing him compensation. Courts have ruled that the approval process for his pay package was flawed, leading to its rejection despite shareholder support.Musk himself has acknowledged the situation, stating that he has worked without pay for years. However, with Tesla facing market volatility and leadership concerns, some experts argue that it may be time to restructure his compensation to ensure stability and long-term commitment.Tesla’s board is now weighing options for a new compensation plan. Some analysts suggest a performance-based stock package, while others argue Musk should receive a traditional CEO salary to align with industry standards.","Elon Musk received zero salary from Tesla in 2024, making him the lowest-paid CEO among S&P 500 companies.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges



Also Read |

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success. Such resilience has been a major pillar in Nvidia's culture and Huang's own leadership style.Stephen Witt further discloses that Huang is motivated to a large extent by guilt. Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently. Witt clarifies that Huang's motivation is not mere ambition but also a combination of the fear of failure, paranoia among competitors, and the guilt of possibly disappointing others. This generates tremendous internal pressure that Huang leverages as an impetus to remain focused and drive Nvidia to its greatest heights.",Jensen Huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry.

Once political allies, Elon Musk and Donald Trump are now embroiled in a fierce and highly public feud that blends politics, tech, and personal grievance. What started as a disagreement over Trump’s sweeping domestic spending bill quickly escalated into a bitter war of words, with Musk unleashing a series of social media posts criticizing government waste and Trump retaliating with personal attacks and threats to sever federal ties with Musk’s companies. The fallout has been swift and dramatic, pulling in lawmakers, press secretaries, and even pop culture figures. Below is a detailed post-by-post timeline of how their alliance collapsed.Elon Musk criticizes Trump’s new tax and spending package, labelling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill” and a “disgusting abomination.”He claims the bill would undo all the savings achieved by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he recently served as an advisor.Trump reacts by sharing Musk’s earlier resignation from his government role, suggesting betrayal.Musk reposts claims that the majority of Republican voters want the bill “trimmed down,” adding a simple “Yes.”He shares an old Trump post criticizing GOP lawmakers for raising the debt ceiling, adding the comment “wise words.”Musk digs up another Trump post stating no lawmaker should be re-elected if the U.S. budget isn’t balanced, saying, “I couldn’t agree more.”Trump tells reporters he’s “very disappointed” in Musk after his repeated criticism and acknowledges the relationship may be over.He suggests a trimmed-down version of Trump’s legislation, posting: “Slim Beautiful Bill for the win.”Musk surprisingly supports cuts to electric vehicle incentives if it means reducing government spending.He disputes Trump’s claim that he reviewed the bill, stating he was “not shown the bill even once.”Musk posts that Trump wouldn’t have won the election without his help — a bold assertion.In a follow-up, Musk calls Trump ungrateful and shares a video of Trump praising him earlier in the year.Musk urges lawmakers to preserve green energy cuts but slash the “crazy spending increases” in the bill.He warns that the proposed bill would balloon the U.S. deficit to $2.5 trillion.In a short and pointed post, Musk calls to “Kill Bill,” referencing the proposed legislation.He starts a poll on X asking whether America needs a new political party.To counter Trump’s implied criticisms, Musk shares a video from 2021 claiming Tesla doesn't need EV subsidies to survive.In response to Laura Loomer, Musk amplifies the message that Trump only has a few years left, while he’ll be a force for decades.He posts an old quote from House Speaker Mike Johnson on debt concerns, captioning it: “Where is the Mike Johnson 2023!?”He claims that most of Congress passed the bill without even reading it.Musk shares a video of John Thune raising red flags about the deficit in 2020, asking, “Where is the John Thune of 2020??”He reposts a satirical Jerome Powell account that questions whether Musk or Trump is right.He again shares an old post from Speaker Johnson urging spending cuts, saying, “I super agree wi[th this].”In a sweeping rebuke, Musk claims the new budget plan would lead to national financial ruin.Trump says he asked Musk to leave the administration and revoked his EV mandate, blaming Musk’s behavior on that fallout.Trump suggests the federal government could save money by canceling contracts and subsidies for Musk’s companies.He refutes Trump’s framing, stating that the disagreement isn’t about EVs — it’s about fiscal sanity.In a stunning escalation, Musk posts that Trump is named in Jeffrey Epstein’s files.He follows up with ominous posts suggesting more revelations are coming.Rapper Ye weighs in on the feud, though the details of his position remain unclear.House Speaker Johnson breaks with Musk and defends the president’s budget proposal.Trump complains about Musk going public with his criticism during a crucial push for legislative approval.Musk makes a jaw-dropping statement, threatening to pull the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft from NASA use.He agrees with an X user advocating impeachment of President Trump over the spending bill.Tesla’s value drops 14% in a single day, wiping out $150 billion — a stark sign of the chaos caused by the feud.He blames Trump’s tariffs for putting the U.S. economy on the edge of recession.He posts a video showing Trump partying with Epstein, punctuated with a raised eyebrow emoji.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calls Musk’s post “an unfortunate episode” and blames his outrage on the bill excluding his favoured policies.What began as a simple policy disagreement has exploded into a full-blown feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, marked by ideological clashes, personal insults, and public showdowns. Once political allies, the two now represent opposing forces in America’s cultural and political landscape. Musk, initially supportive of Trump’s deregulation agenda, has since distanced himself, criticizing the former president’s rhetoric and leadership style. In turn, Trump has lashed out at Musk on social media, mocking his business ventures and political relevance. Their escalating rivalry highlights a deep rift within conservative politics—and judging by their latest posts, the battle is far from over.","Elon Musk and Donald Trump are embroiled in a fierce and highly public feud that blends politics, tech, and personal grievance.

GURGAON: A shift by Gurugram University to the govt-run Samarth portal around 7 months ago has resulted in academic disruption for thousands of students, with many still awaiting the outcome of exams held in Dec.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

MUMBAI: A former state govt employee was cheated of Rs 1.4 crore by cyber scammers who first led him to believe that he was interacting with a provident fund (PF) official and then scared him into thinking the official was arrested by the CBI. The 73-year-old complainant made payments for 1.5 years before realising that he had been taken for a ride and the documents sent to him were bogus.The west cyber police have registered an FIR and are investigating further.The complainant lives in Andheri with his family. In May 2023, he got a phone call purportedly from the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), New Delhi. The caller introduced himself as Alok Mehta. He told the complainant his PF dues were pending with the organisation and he could claim them once he paid Rs 7,230 as security charges. After the complainant paid the money, Mehta sent him a letter purportedly from the ministry of finance over WhatsApp. The letter had a govt of India seal on it and the complainant was convinced of its authenticity. The document said he would receive Rs 63.08 lakh if he made a payment of Rs 3.8 lakh.Over the next 10 months, Mehta and two other ""EPFO representatives"" Sunita Tiwari and one Chakraborty stayed in touch with the complainant and got him to pay Rs 60 lakh under various pretexts.In March 2024, the complainant got a phone call from one Mahi Sharma who claimed to be an officer with the CBI's Mumbai office. She said Mehta had been arrested by the CBI for misappropriation of funds and the complainant's PF file had now come to the CBI for scrutiny. The complainant was left shaken.Sharma assured him his PF dues would be paid to him once she completed a thorough probe into his case. Subsequently, she sent him a cheque of his PF dues, but warned him to pay 30% as taxes. She also asked for charges towards issuing him a no-objection certificate as his PF dues were exceeding a crore. The complainant kept making payments as instructed by Sharma till Nov 2024. When he presented the cheque for encashing, he was told it was counterfeit. He approached cops. Police filed an FIR on May 28 and will probe who operated the bank accounts into which the funds were transferred.",A former state govt employee was cheated of Rs 1.4 crore by cyber scammers.

Trump ropes in Palantir to compile data on Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-ropes-in-palantir-to-compile-data-on-americans/articleshow/121702831.cms,"US President Donald Trump





WASHINGTON: In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the federal govt to share data across agencies, raising questions over whether he might compile a master list of personal information on Americans that could give him untold surveillance power.Trump has not publicly talked about the effort since. But behind the scenes, officials have quietly put technological building blocks into place to enable his plan.In particular, they have turned to one company: Palantir, the data analysis and technology firm.Representatives of Palantir are also speaking to at least two other agencies - the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service - about buying its technology. The push has put a key Palantir product called Foundry into at least four federal agencies, including DHS and the health and human services department. Widely adopting Foundry, which organizes and analyzes data, paves the way for Trump to easily merge information from different agencies, govt officials said.Creating detailed portraits of Americans based on govt data is not just a pipe dream. The Trump administration has already sought access to hundreds of data points on citizens and others through government databases, including their bank account numbers, the amount of their student debt, their medical claims and any disability status.Trump could potentially use such information to advance his political agenda by policing immigrants and punishing critics, Democratic lawmakers and critics have said. Privacy advocates, student unions and labour rights organizations have filed lawsuits to block data access, questioning whether the govt could weaponize people's personal information.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the federal govt to share data across agencies.

'Kabul’s Water Crisis: An Inflection Point for Action',

Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, warns a recent report. The report titledreleased recently by the NGO Mercy Corps, outlines in detail the city’s worsening water emergency and urges immediate international and domestic attention.The report says that Kabul’s groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year, with the water table having dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, cited in the report, the city’s aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people. The situation is already critical—nearly half of the boreholes, Kabul residents’ primary source of drinking water, are dry.An aquifer is an underground layer of rock, sand, or soil that holds water. It acts like a natural water tank. People access this water through wells, but if too much is taken out and not enough refills it (like from rain or snow), the aquifer can run dry.The report says, ""Kabul’s water crisis represents a failure of governance, humanitarian coordination, water regulation, and infrastructure planning... Without immediate intervention, the city risks becoming the first modern capital in the world to fully deplete its water reserves.""Kabul’s water largely comes from three main aquifers, recharged by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush mountains. However, due to climate change and recurring droughts, snow and rain have significantly declined. From October 2023 to January 2024, Afghanistan received only 45–60% of its normal winter precipitation. According to the report, ""Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country in the world to impacts of climate change,"" and Kabul is already seeing the effects, with reduced snowfall and shorter winters reducing the volume of meltwater.""Shorter winters also mean less time for snow to accumulate on the Hindu Kush, and thus less meltwater runoff in the spring, even as the city’s demand for water rapidly increases,"" the report says.On the infrastructure side, only 20% of households in Kabul are connected to centralised piped water systems. Most residents rely on water pumped from borewells, many of which are unregulated or drying up. ""90% of Kabul’s residents rely on water pumped from borewells to supply their daily needs,"" the report says.The report also highlights water quality issues. ""As much as 80% of Kabul’s groundwater is contaminated with sewage, toxins, and dangerously high levels of chemicals such as arsenic and nitrates,"" posing major health risks. In interviews conducted for the report, 70% of residents said their well water had issues such as bad taste, odor, or discoloration.Economically, the crisis has forced families to spend 15–30% of their monthly income on water. In some cases, private water companies extract water and sell it back to residents at high prices. ""Weekly water costs for a single household reach 400–500 Afghanis ($6–7), exceeding food expenses for more than half of households,"" the report notes. ""To meet this financial burden, families are forced to borrow more, placing them deeper into debt. 68% of households incur water-related debt, with informal lenders charging 15–20% monthly interest.""The city’s main water sources like the Qargha Reservoir and Shah-wa-Arous Dam are either underperforming or newly operational. Long-planned projects such as the Panjshir River Pipeline and Shah Toot Dam remain delayed due to funding and political issues.Governance challenges are also severe. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), responsible for water quality monitoring, has lost about 40% of its technical staff, ""largely due to technical staff fleeing the country."" Due to a lack of international recognition and funding cuts, like from USAID, the agency cannot conduct full water testing and lacks access to basic equipment.The report warns that unless urgent changes are made—including better governance, water infrastructure investment, and international cooperation—Kabul could face a humanitarian crisis. ""Without large-scale changes to Kabul’s water management dynamics, the city faces an unprecedented humanitarian disaster within the coming decade, and likely much sooner,"" it concludes.","Kabul's groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year. The water table has dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, the city's aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121694249,imgsize-1385292,width-400,resizemode-4/121694249.jpg"

Fugitive liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya has told a podcast, in a rare interview, that he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.At the time there was supposed to be a CBI lookout circular (LOC) issued against him.Mallya told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI from detaining him to informing immigration of authorities of his travel plans.He told Shamani that certain TV anchors and the Indian govt want to see him in “jail clothes, eating jail food” in Tihar and spending the rest of his life behind bars. “If that is what is inevitable, what options do I have? It might be inevitable, I’m not an astrologer. I will fight my way in court.”He said: “I told FM Arun Jaitley before leaving for the airport and then I flew from Delhi to London on the way to Geneva for a meeting which was fixed months ago.

Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.","Vijay Mallya says he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016. He told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI to informing immigration of his travel plans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121683967,imgsize-26222,width-400,resizemode-4/121683967.jpg"
