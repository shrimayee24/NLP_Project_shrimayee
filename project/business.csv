Kota story: Why it remains a magnet for aspirants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kota-story-why-it-remains-a-magnet-for-aspirants/articleshow/111011238.cms,"A man Mahavar’s journey isn’t your typical, linear adversity-to-success story. He’s been a struggler all his life. After seven failed attempts to clear NEET until 2022, all he had was the consolation of going back to a job as a postman in Bikaner.Then Kota happened to him. In true Bollywood style, luck by chance.“I was working in a post office when I heard about Kota-based Motion Education’s scholarship lottery,” he recounts to TOI. “I filled out the online form and got selected. My grounded dream was back in motion.”Aman, who worked as a newspaper vendor and in shops since his school days to supplement his mother’s income as a worker in a hospital ward, is now on his way to becoming a doctor.In 2023, he cracked NEET on his eighth attempt and got a seat at GMC Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Ramanathapuram. “It’s the best thing to have happened to me. I know the respect a doctor gets,” he says.Aman isn’t the only one to have his outlook towards failure, success, risk and process questioned and transformed in the often scoffed-at coaching hub of Kota in Rajasthan.Most students who get past JEE Mains, JEE Advanced or NEET – arguably the toughest cycle of entrance exams in the world for sheer scale and competition – credit their success to the innovative, structured and personalised teaching methods employed by coaching institutes in Kota.Ved Sunil Kumar Shinde from Nagpur in Maharashtra, the all-India topper in NEET UG 2024 with 720/720, says studying at Allen Career Institute in Kota shaped his thought process in a manner that competitive exams didn’t appear as intimidating as he had imagined them to be.“We were motivated to compete in a healthy manner. Preparing for NEET at Allen proved the turning point for me, also helping me in the board exams. I did well in both,” says Ved.These institutes, some of which have spread their reach across India by setting up learning centres in cities and towns, operate on a model designed to train engineering and medical science aspirants to maximise their chances of making the cut rather than making them feel something is unachievable.For underprivileged students like Aman, many of these institutes provide financial support to get through the journey. The rest are encouraged to aim for in-house scholarships of up to 90% of the annual fee in some cases.Allen Institute runs a programme that offers free coaching to underprivileged students from government schools in predominantly Hindi-speaking states. These students are selected through a school-level examination. Those who qualify are brought to Kota, where the institute entirely covers their education, accommodation, and living expenses. This year, 126 students were selected.In 2023, about 2.5 lakh students received coaching in Kota, with over 85,000 new admissions by May. The city has 4,200-odd hostels, 25,000 PG rooms, and scores of one-bedroom apartments, some of which are rented by parents and guardians.Allen’s director, Rajesh Maheshwari, underscores the institute’s commitment to aiding students in need both academically and financially.“We try to make sure every student who wants help with studies specifically for these entrance exams gets proper mentorship. Children whose parents died in the line of duty are given education free of cost, no questions asked,” says Maheshwari.Aspirants who can’t attend classroom teaching for various reasons, including medical, have the option of recorded lectures.Maulik Patel, a student at Allen Institute, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2022, but recorded lectures ensured his studies and exam preparation didn’t suffer as much during the duration of his treatment and recovery.“After my first surgery, I was unable to attend coaching classes for a long time. Recorded lectures from Allen kept me in the preparation loop. My health improved after a second surgery last year, and I was able to take all major practice tests and rebuild my confidence,” he recalls.Maulik scored 94.67% in the Maharashtra state board’s Class 12 exam and 715/720 in NEET UG.In addition to recorded lectures, students at Kota institutes have access to equipped self-study rooms, immediate doubt-clearing sessions, online notes, and even professional counselling.AI is the latest entrant into this unique teaching system, spawning models like a “homework machine”.“At Motion, we have been using this AI-based homework machine built to give personalised questions for practice, based on the weaknesses and strengths of the student,” says Nitin Vijay, founder and CEO of Motion Education.“When students practice or take tests through this app, we identify the concepts they are unable to grasp. They are more likely to skip a question based on a concept they haven’t understood. If they guess, chances are they will get it wrong.”Institutes also focus on practicals to ensure comprehensive exam preparation. Resonance Eduventures Ltd, like the other large institutes, has fully-loaded labs for physics, chemistry and biology to improve students’ conceptual clarity.Additionally, digital classrooms and extempore competitions help build students’ confidence, complementing their academic training.","Most students who get past JEE Mains, JEE Advanced or NEET credit their success to the innovative, structured and personalised teaching methods employed by coaching institutes in Kota.

What’s behind close call at Mumbai airport?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-behind-close-call-at-mumbai-airport/articleshow/111010480.cms,"As Authorities Probe

Incident

Involving Air India And IndiGo Flights, Busy Schedules And Ignored Norms Are As Much Under Focus As The Peculiar

Runway

Infrastructure

India’s Busiest Airstrip

Too Close For Comfort

The ATC Question

Intersecting Runways

The incident of two planes coming within a whisker of each other on the Mumbai airport runway last week has raised serious questions: Has traffic density cut safety margins at the Mumbai airport? Is this kind of ‘bumper-to-bumper’ air traffic even normal? Had the aircraft taking off slowed down for some reason would the landing aircraft have crashed into it? Who was responsible for this dangerous situation — the pilots, Air Traffic Control (ATC) or a system that forces an infrastructure-constrained Mumbai airport to handle more and more flights?The incident was reminiscent of the runway collision at Haneda airport in Tokyo on Jan 2 this year. A Japan Airlines A350 aircraft collided upon landing with a Japan coast guard turboprop aircraft that was on the same runway. It was found that the Japan Airlines flight was given landing clearance while the Coast Guard aircraft did not have permission to be on the same runway.In Mumbai’s case, airlines operating the two flights have both said they had an all-clear from ATC — one to land and the other to take-off.Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the matter but it will be a while before the final report is out. Meanwhile, Airports Authority of India (AAI), the country’s air navigation provider, has already put in measures based on the preliminary findings.On June 8, an IndiGo aircraft touched down on runway 27 merely a second after an Air India aircraft took off. At that moment, the distance between the two aircraft was about 2,100 feet, sources said.The norm is to wait for the aircraft taking off to lift off and fly past the runway end before the aircraft landing can be allowed to cross the beginning of the runway.The 11,302ft long asphalt strip that is Mumbai airport’s runway 27 is arguably the priciest piece of real estate in the city, rented by the second to airlines that book time slots for takeoff and landing.An A320 or B737 aircraft takes an average of 40 to 50 seconds on the runway for a take-off or landing. Between each aircraft movement, a buffer or safety margin of about 20 seconds is maintained in normal conditions.‘Runway Occupancy Time’ or ROT, is thus a crucial parameter for flight operations at space-constrained Mumbai. Unlike most airports where distance is the criterion for maintaining a gap between two aircraft, Mumbai uses a time-based separation.Called ‘TTT’, or ‘Time to Threshold’, the ATC allows a take-off if the landing aircraft is a minimum of 70 seconds away from the runway threshold. “Time-based separation allows for more aircraft movement. In 24 hours, we save about 30 minutes,” said a senior air traffic controller. But if an aircraft is slow to take-off or if a landing aircraft comes in too fast, quick remedial steps need be taken by ATC.Two A320neo aircraft — AI flight AI-657 from Mumbai to Thiruvananthapuram and IndiGo flight 6E5053 from Indore to Mumbai — were involved in the inci dent. “The domino was triggered by the AI aircraft,” air safety expert Capt. Amit Singh said on the basis of Flightradar24 data.The incident unfolded in the 90 seconds after an Iraqi Airways flight took off and the AI aircraft entered the runway for take-off. “The AI aircraft was slow to take-off after getting line-up clearance. Of course, one is assuming it received immediate take-off clearance,” added Singh.Per the norm, the AI pilot should have informed ATC about the delay in taking-off, which would have triggered a cancellation of his take-off clearance. But the AI pilots didn’t do that. They continued with the slow take-off. Meanwhile, the InidGo pilots were on an approach to land.The AI aircraft had not lifted off when the IndiGo aircraft crossed the beginning of the runway (the runway threshold with piano key markings is further down the line).Did the IndiGo pilots err too? It appears so. Once they spotted an aircraft on the runway, they should have aborted landing and initiated a goaround. The norms state that ATC clearance is immaterial if a pilot spots a danger. “If pilots perceive at any point that it is not safe to continue approach, they must initiate a go-around,” it says.The incident occurred in clear weather. Pilots can hear each other communicate with the controller on the radio communications channel. Senior pilots pointed out that IndiGo pilots should not have continued with the landing after sighting the AI aircraft on the runway.DGCA has derostered the controller for investigations. Two days after the incident, AAI issued a circular stating that the preliminary investigation revealed violation of the standard operating procedure for ‘Time-Based Spacing’ between arrivals.“If the controller observes a delay in aircraft commencing take-off run after issuance of take-off clearance, the take-off clearance will be cancelled and the aircraft shall be instructed to vacate the runway immediately,” the SOP states. Since the AI aircraft took longer to begin the take-off roll, the controller should have cancelled its take-off permission, while also asking the IndiGo aircraft to carry out a missed approach or go-around.“The question is the degree of responsibility on each — the controller, the pilots and, most importantly, the runway infrastructure constraints at Mumbai airport that puts controllers and pilots in such situations,” said Singh.When the incident occurred, around 6.15 am, none of the airlines involved in the incident were scheduled to be on the runway. The delayed Iraqi Airways flight to Najaf took-off at 6.14 am though it was scheduled for a 5 am departure. The AI flight was scheduled to depart at 5.45 am, but was running over 20 minutes late. The IndiGo flight had a scheduled arrival at 6.40 am, but came in 20 minutes early.The peak-hour declared capacity of main runway 27 is 46 aircraft movements (arrivals/ departures). But Mumbai ATC often ends up handling close to 55 flight movements in 60 minutes as flights that are delayed or arrive early encroach into other flights’ slots. But on the congested Mumbai runway, the effects of “time slot indiscipline” can create potentially dangerous situations.Bunching up of flights during peak hours adds to the workload of both controllers and pilots. The major airports in the world and those in India, such as Delhi and Bengaluru are served by parallel runways, which allows for two runways to be used simultaneously. But Mumbai airport has a set of cross runways and so only one runway is in use at a time. More often than not, it is the workhorse runway 27.",Two planes came within a whisker of each other on the Mumbai airport runway last week. The incident has raised serious questions: Has traffic density cut safety margins at the airport? Is this kind of ‘bumper-to-bumper’ air traffic even normal?

"Kozhikode To London, A cyclist’s odyssey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kozhikode-to-london-a-cyclists-odyssey/articleshow/111010560.cms,"Fayis Asraf Ali’s

across 36 countries on a cycle spanned two years. The most cherished souvenirs he collected were the heartwarming acts of kindness bestowed by strangers

An intrepid Malayali adventurer has cycled over 18,000 miles through 36 countries from Kerala to London in a mind-blowing odyssey which took him almost two years. Fayis Asraf Ali, 37, an electronics and communications engineer from Kozhikode , left Thiruvananthapuram on Aug 1, 2022 and reached London on June 1, 2024 after riding through blistering heat and freezing cold weather on his Surly Disc Trucker, which weighed 50kg with his luggage.His two sons, Fahzin Omar (9) and Izin Nahel (5), his dentist wife, Dr Asmin Fayis, his mother and a bunch of his British Malayali friends, greeted him at Dover on May 29 after he crossed the English Channel by ferry from Calais. He camped on the beach and then spent two days cycling to his destination, the iconic Tower Bridge in London.Speaking from Newcastle, Ali told TOI: “Reaching the final point was a very big moment. My kids rushed up and hugged me. My children missed me but you have to sacrifice something to achieve something. They are proud of me.”The trip cost Rs25 lakh and Ali put in Rs2 lakh of his money towards it and raised the rest as he travelled, getting donations of money or food from local people and the Indian community, via a sign he parked in front of his bike telling passers-by he had cycled from India.Ali was taken aback by the hospitality he faced, with many locals inviting him into their homes.“People like cycling and they were shocked when they heard I cycled from India so were happy to donate money or food,” he said. In Antwerp, a homeless woman wandered up to him and gave him five euros.The journey took him through countries including Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Greece, North Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, and France. “In Saudi, they provided police protection for me on the highways,” he said.The most he cycled in a day was in Turkey---175km. Otherwise, he cycled slowly as his bike was so heavy. He camped in the wild and near the roads rather than on campsites. His favourite country of all was the Netherlands. “The cycle lanes are perfect, and they even have them in small villages,” he said.In Denmark, a mother and daughter saw him cycling and when he told them he had cycled from India, they invited him to their house for a coffee and cake. “They were curious to know about my journey,” he said.He had no major mishaps along the way apart from losing his wallet during his 25-day stay in Iran. “I lost it when I was buying a sim card. For four days I had no money. An Iranian family, who spoke a little English, invited me to their house and said I could stay there and they gave me money also. Iran is beautiful, there are so many places to see,” he said. “Iraq was the most dangerous country I visited but now it is under control and is not that dangerous,” he explained. “I travelled on highways and there were lots of military checkpoints. I was scared, but I realized the people are really nice.”His favourite food of all was the Iskender kebabs in Turkey. During the trip, he gave talks at schools and universities and visited embassies. His goal was to spread awareness of fitness, eradicating polio, promoting conflict resolution, encouraging net zero and speaking against drugs. “People treated me like family,” he said, his phone bulging with the contact numbers of people from all over the world.It was his father’s illness which triggered this passion. He gave up his job as a network engineer in Saudi Arabia in 2015, when his father became critically ill, so he could look after him, being his only son. “I realized health is more important than money. I decided I should do some activities and started cycling and cycling became part of my life,” he said. His father passed away aged 67 in 2018.In Aug 2019 Ali did his first big cycle trip from India to Singapore across seven countries, pedalling nearly 5,000 miles arriving in Nov.Next, he plans to cycle through South America and North America. “I never felt lonely. Every day I was meeting new people and having new adventures and my wife was always on the end of the phone. It was exciting to experience new cultures. When I reached Tower Bridge I felt both happy and sad. Happy as I had achieved my goal and sad that it had ended.”","Fayis Asraf Ali, 37, left Thiruvananthapuram on Aug 1, 2022 and reached London on June 1, 2024.

With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week.

A lot hinges on the USA vs Ireland game in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday, but the flood situation in Florida and forecast for more spells of heavy rain threaten to wash out the game, which works in favour of the home team.The three remaining matches in Group A are all scheduled to be held at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida.It is one of the three stadiums in the US hosting some of the group-stage matches of the T20 World Cup. The other two venues are in New York and Dallas.On Friday, USA find themselves on the brink of another history-making moment with a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' stage in their debut appearance in the T20 World Cup, and the inclement weather in Florida can make the equation even simpler.If the game gets washed out, USA will move to five points and finish at No. 2 to join group-leaders India as the two teams to enter the 'Super 8s'. That will leave the remaining two matches of the group in Florida -- India vs Canada (June 15) andPakistan vs Ireland (June 16) -- meaningless.However, if weather allows a result-oriented game on Friday and Ireland manage to beat the US, it will breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign. The Babar Azam-led team will then have to beat Ireland, which will take Pakistan through to the next stage in the tournament, edging out USA on net run-rate.For the third day in a row, a line of storms spanning from the west to the east coast of Florida brought heavy rainfall and flooding to certain areas on Thursday, increasing the risk of flash flooding into the evening hours -- according to an AP report.Meteorologists have cautioned residents of Florida to brace for more flash flooding following a tropical disturbance that brought up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain to the southern regions of the state. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate on Friday.Heavy rainfall on Wednesday caused flash flooding from Fort Lauderdale to downtown Miami.Forecasters predict higher rainfall totals, with an additional 4 to 8 inches expected and the possibility of some areas receiving over 10 inches.","USA play Ireland in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday.

Work will start soon to chalk out “train path” to operate around 1,000 such trips in a year, which will have more general and sleeper coaches, sources said.A train path is the infrastructure capacity needed to run a train between two places over a given time-period. Sources said these additional trains on high demand routes will have the same fare and will also have some AC coaches. “These won’t be replicas of popular trains since these will have not more than two AC3 coaches. The remaining coaches will be general and sleeper coaches. This will cater to a large section of passengers,” said a source.Officials said running these trains with the current line capacity won’t be an issue. Currently, the railways operate around 3,000 mail and express trains daily.Vaishnaw on Thursday held a review meeting with all members and senior officials of railway board along with general managers of zonal railways and divisional railway managers via video conferencing on issues, including overcrowding of trains, security, safety measures for operations and punctuality of trains.TOI has learnt that considering the increasing demand, Vaishnaw asked officers to prepare the plan to ramp up production of general and sleeper coaches to 2,500 per year. “We need to have more general and sleeper coaches to run additional trains. As we augment the capacity, we will have enough scope to add more trains in the next couple of years,” said an official.In an official release, the railway ministry said Vaishnaw emphasised that safety and infrastructure are paramount and there cannot be any compromise on these fronts. “On punctuality front, the minister directed officials to analyse the root cause of train detention on certain stretches which impact the overall punctuality. He said that unwarranted train detentions shall not be acceptable. Punctuality figures are to be strictly monitored and overall punctuality should be improved,” it said.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has directed officials to work on a plan to deploy special trains for the same destinations that can be run 30-40 minutes before or after the scheduled departure of popular trains.

"One in three elders had no income in past one year, only 29% had access to pension, provident fund",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-in-three-elders-had-no-income-in-past-one-year-only-29-had-access-to-pension-provident-fund/articleshow/111007018.cms,",

NEW DELHI: One in every three elders reported not having any income in the past one year, 32% elderly or their spouses had an annual income of less than Rs 50,000 and only 29% elderly reported having access to social security schemes like old-age pension, contributory pension or provident fund. Nearly, 65% of elders reported that they were financially not secure with their current income and access to savings and investments.These findings are part of a report released by voluntary organisation ‘HelpAge India’ on the eve of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day observed on June 15.On the health frontmore than half the elderly (52%) reported facing at least one challenge related to activities of daily living and 54% suffered from two or more non-communicable diseases.As many as 5,169 elders and 1,333 caregivers’ primary family members were surveyed across 20 Tier I and Tier II cities, in 10 states. The study captured the experiences of elderly from cities like Jaipur, Bikaner, Faridabad, Panipat, Kanpur, Bareilly, Indore, Ujjain, Kolkata, Siliguri, Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Greater Mumbai, Solapur, Chennai, Salem, Bengaluru and Hubli-Dharwad.These findings are important in the backdrop of the significant demographic shift in India with the population above 60 to double from 10.5% in 2022 to 20.8% by 2050.The report, ‘Ageing in India: Exploring Preparedness & Response to Care Challenges’, showed that only 31% elderly reported access to health insurance. Coverage was largely under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, along with ESI and CGHS. A very small proportion of respondents (3%) reported purchase of commercial health insurance. The reasons for not havinghealth insurance were mainly focused on lack of awareness (32%), affordability (24%) and lack of need for it (12%).Elder abuse continues to be a major concern, with 7% elderly admitting to being a victim of abuse with sons (42%) and daughters-in-law (28%) being the primary perpetrators. “A higher percentage of elderly who faced abuse in the past one year were illiterate, and the abuse increased with decrease in income of the elderly, as the majority of the respondents (73%) who faced abuse reported an annual income of less than Rs 100,000,” the report said.Also, most elderly who faced abuse were suffering from NCDs. Almost all elderly (94%) who faced abuse reported at least one chronic disease. This increased the dependency levels of elders on family members, the report said.Regarding types of action taken to resist elder abuse, most elders who experienced abuse revealed that they have scolded or requested the abusers to not do so in the future, others have either reported to their friends or other trusted members in the family or they didn’t do anything at all. A negligible portion reported that they have lodged a police complaint regarding the abuse.Sadly, awareness about the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizen Act, which is an important enabling legal resource for the distressed elderly, is still quite low at 9%.The study shows that the family played the role of primary caregivers, when the elderly were bedridden and highly dependent. Almost all elders reported that their spouses or children took care of them in this situation. ""The demands placed on caregivers are significant, with a majority (68%) of caregivers reporting they provide support to their elderly every day. On an average, a caregiver has spent around 20 hours in the past week that is close to three hours every day,"" it is highlighted.Infact, the caregivers in the family faced their own challenges with around 29% of the caregivers reporting physical challenges in providing care to the elderly person, while 32% also reported facing financial challenges in providing care to the elderly.On the digital empowerment front, while 41% of elders reported having access to a digital device , 59% did not have access to a digital device. The most common device being used was a smart phone, with 39% elders having access to it. The gender digital divide was quite prominent, with 48% male elderly having access to a digital device, as against 33% women elderly. It comes through in the analysis that access to digital devices dropped significantly with increasing age, with only 26% of those above 80 years reporting having access to any digital device.HelpAge India CEO Rohit Prasad asserted that aAs people live longer and elderly population grows, some segments like the 80 plus, those living alone and older women face high vulnerability and require a special response. ""There is an urgent need to collectively develop a comprehensive long term care framework on provision and financing, together with all stakeholders,” Prasad said.","One in every three elders reported not having any income in the past one year. 65% of elders reported that they were financially not secure with their current income.

"El Nino's reign ends, boost for August-September rains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/el-ninos-reign-ends-boost-for-august-september-rains/articleshow/111006966.cms,"After dominating global weather for nearly a year, El Nino 's reign has finally ended, US weather agencies reported late Thursday. The update said the Pacific Ocean is likely to transition to La Nina in around two months' time, which implies that conditions will generally favour good monsoon rainfall in India in the second half of the season (Aug-Sept).The latest update from US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration gives a 65% probability of La Nina developing in July-Sept period, a little later than what last month's forecast suggested, but still in time to potentially impact the monsoon. Last month's NOAA forecast had given nearly 50% probability of La Nina conditions developing in the June-Aug period, which has since dipped to around 40%.This is largely in line with IMD's forecast of an above-normal monsoon in India during the four-month season at 106% of long period average, with increased probability of good rains in latter half.""Latest US forecast is a good sign for the monsoon. Even if La Nina is declared around Aug, temperature anomalies that characterise the condition are already developing. The transition from neutral to La Nina during the monsoon season augurs well,"" said M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of Union earth sciences ministry.La Nina is a meteorological condition recurring every three to seven years in which surface waters in central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean cool to below-normal levels, with associated changes in wind patterns impacting weather across large parts of the globe. El Nino is the opposite condition, characterised by abnormal heating up of ocean waters. El Nino/La Nina is the single largest natural source of year-to-year variations in seasonal climate.While El Nino events generally lead to below-par monsoons in India, last year being an exception, La Nina usually aids good monsoon rains. The last El Nino developed around May 2023 and peaked in Dec-Jan as one of five strongest such events on record. NOAA said Thursday that conditions in the Pacific returned to 'neutral' last month, which meant that El Nino had dissipated.Meanwhile, monsoon's onset over India has so far been good - with all of south India & northeast, and most of Maharashtra covered - but the system has weakened and is likely to remain so for 7-10 days, experts say. Countrywide rainfall in June has been 12.2% below normal.""With monsoon going into a hiatus, June may end with below-normal rainfall,"" said Rajeevan. Monsoon's weakening also dims hopes of rains arriving early in north India, which is currently reeling under an unprecedentedly long and severe heat spell.","Latest US forecast is a good sign for the monsoon.

The study captured the experiences of elderly from cities like Jaipur, Faridabad, Panipat, Kanpur, Indore, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Solapur, Chennai and Bengaluru.

These findings are important in backdrop of significant demographic shift in India with population above 60 to double from 10.5% in 2022 to 20.8% by 2050. The report, 'Ageing in India: Exploring Preparedness & Response to Care Challenges', showed that only 31% elderly reported access to health insurance.

Speaking at the 50th-anniversary event of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, Dasgupta emphasized the health impacts of climate change in her keynote speech.Heatwaves and Cyclones on the Rise""Bengal, due to its geographic location, is among the most vulnerable states in India,"" said Dasgupta. ""The number of heatwave days and the frequency of cyclones have increased tremendously."" Dasgupta and her team analyzed morbidity and mortality data in Bengal, revealing a significant correlation between rising temperatures and health complications.Air Pollution and Climate ChangeAbhijit Chatterjee of the Bose Institute highlighted the dual threat posed by air pollution and climate change. ""The sources of both air pollution and climate change are the same. Fighting air pollution proves beneficial for mitigating climate change,"" he explained. Chatterjee's study indicated that air pollution is increasingly threatening the mangrove ecosystem of the Sundarbans in West Bengal, which acts as a natural barrier protecting Kolkata from extreme weather.""The study revealed significant amounts of pollutants, mainly black carbon or soot particles, arriving from Kolkata and the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region, are deteriorating the Sundarbans' air quality and affecting its ecosystem,"" Chatterjee added.Water Resources Under StressKalyan Rudra, chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), addressed the serious stress on Bengal's water resources due to increasing demand and wasteful practices. ""With the ever-growing population, per capita water availability has plummeted from 5,177 cubic meters in 1951 to 1,465 cubic meters in 2025,"" Rudra noted.Since the mid-1960s, India has shifted from dry crops to more water-intensive varieties, leading to overexploitation of groundwater and contamination of the food chain through indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Rudra emphasized the need for sustainable water management practices, stating, ""Harnessing every drop of rainwater is a national priority. We should focus on localized, decentralized water resource management, which is cost-effective and encourages community participation.""International Collaboration and Future OutlookBangladesh Deputy High Commissioner in Kolkata, Andalib Elias, echoed Rudra's concerns, highlighting the disproportionate impact of climate change on Bangladesh. ""Our contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is negligible, yet we bear the brunt of climate change the most. With the current rate of warming, it's not far when at least one-third of our country will go underwater,"" Elias warned.Elias and Rudra both stressed the importance of Indo-Bangladesh collaboration in research and data exchange to combat the effects of climate change. They advocated for international support through the loss and damage fund to protect vulnerable regions like the Sundarbans.Rudra concluded his remarks by quoting ecologist Hubert Reeves: ""We're at war with nature. If we win, we're lost.""

Global civil society organisations, Public Eye and IBFAN, have submitted a formal request to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), urging legal action against Nestle “unethical and unfair business practices” in low- and middle-income countries.

Accusing the Swiss major of “double standards”, the NGOs had in April said the company’s two best-selling baby food brands sold in developing countries, including India, have a high content of added sugar, which is prohibited under WHO guidelines. Nestle’s misleading and aggressive marketing and its double standard over added sugar are unfair business practices that affect hundreds of thousands of people in poor countries, they said. The cessation of unethical practices is important not only to protect children, but also the reputation of Nestle’s home country, they said.

When contacted, a Nestle India spokesperson said: “We understand that the authorities are conducting analysis of infant cereals and infant formulas sold by all companies in the country.” It maintained its commitment to compliance and highlighted a reduction in sugar content by up to 30% in its baby food products in India over the past five years.

In April, days after the issue became public, Nestle India’s chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan had said Cerelac complied with local food norms, saying added sugars in the baby food are much lower than what India’s food regulator permits.

The food giant controls 20% of the baby food market, valued at nearly $70 billion. With over $2.5 billion in global sales in 2022, Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestle’s best-selling baby food brands in low- and middle-income countries.

"Market crash worse than the 2008 recession, warns Economist Harvey Dent",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-crash-worse-than-the-2008-recession-warns-economist-harvey-dent/articleshow/110947932.cms,"Economist Harvey Dent (Photo: X handle)

NEW DELHI: Financial author and economist predicted another "" crash of a lifetime ,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Dent warned that the ""everything"" bubble has not yet burst, and the resulting crash could be more severe than the Great Recession.

Dent highlighted the unique nature of the current situation, stating, ""In 1925 to '29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened."" He likened the government's response to attempting to cure a hangover by drinking more alcohol. Dent suggested that the long-term effects of continuously pumping money into the economy remain to be seen, but he expects a larger crash than the one experienced in 2008-2009 due to the prolonged duration of the current bubble.

Despite the strong performance of US stocks in May, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all posting gains, Dent predicts significant decline. ""I think we're going to see the S&P go down 86% from the top, and the Nasdaq 92%. A hero stock like Nvidia, as good as it is, and it is a great company, [goes] down 98%. Boy, this is over,"" said the economist.

Dent has slightly adjusted the timing of his prediction, now expecting market bottoms to occur between early and mid-2025. He identifies the real estate market as the epicenter of the bubble, claiming that US homes have already increased in value by double or more than their future worth. Dent points to the widespread ownership of homes and the prevalence of speculative second and third home purchases as contributing factors.

In response to critics who label his hypotheses as ""crazy"" or accuse him of fearmongering, Dent said ""I just say what I see and, frankly, don't give a damn if people don't like it, because you [have] got to choose: are you going to tell the truth, or are you going to make people happy?"" He rejects the ""perma-bear"" label, arguing that his predictions are based on historical analysis and the unprecedented power of central banks to create money out of thin air.

Dent advises investors to seek safety in the most secure bonds, emphasizing the United States' position as the world's largest economy and its ability to endure the anticipated downturn. He expects the upcoming crash to be more severe than the one experienced in 2009, as the previous crash was mitigated by stimulus measures. Dent believes this crash will purge excess from the markets, allowing the millennial generation to benefit from a healthier boom in the future.","Economist Harvey Dent predicts another "" crash of a lifetime,"" which could be worse than the 2008 crash.

Locals named a bridge in Konaseema after district collector as Shukla Setu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/locals-named-a-bridge-in-konaseema-after-district-collector-as-shukla-setu/articleshow/111005628.cms,"Vijayawada: In what could be a remarkable achievement in the life of a civil servant, people of Dr BR Ambedkar Konaseema district named a newly constructed bridge after district collector Himanshu Shukla. The bridge connecting the Lutukurru and Pasarlapudi villages has been named as ""Himanshu Shukla Rama Setu"" Interestingly, a bridge connecting MamidiKuduru and Appanapalli villages was named as “Shukla Varadhi"" in the past.The construction of the bridge was taken up as a community-driven development to connect the Lutukurru and Pasarlapudi villages in Dr BR Ambedkar Konaseema district. This vital infrastructure project will benefit the habitations of Lutukurru, Komarada, Makannapalem, Adurru, Madakapalli and Gogannamatham under Pasharlapudi Lanka Gram Panchayat of Mamidi Kuduru mandal. It will help improve in local transportation and community connectivity.The resolution to name the bridge after the district collector was passed unanimously by the Pasarlapudi Lanka Gram Panchayat , acknowledging the collector's tireless efforts and commitment to the project. The construction, costing approximately Rs.1,01,20,000 was made possible through various grants. The funding included Rs.25 lakhs from the MPLads fund, Rs.35 lakhs from Zilla Parishad funds, and Rs. 41.20 lakhs from the District Mineral Fund (DMF).The 75-foot-long and 25.6-foot-wide bridge is set to transform the daily lives of around 15,000 people from seven villages, providing a critical link to Amalapuram town. Previously, the villagers faced numerous challenges due to the dilapidated condition of the old gravel and cement path, which often became impassable during heavy rains, leading to flooding of crop fields and disrupting daily commute.The initiative for the bridge construction stemmed from a direct request by the people of Pasarlapudi Lanka and surrounding villages to district collector Himanshu Shukla. Recognizing the critical need for improved transportation infrastructure, Shukla personally visited the area to assess the situation. His swift action and effective mobilization of resources underscored his dedication to addressing the needs of the district’s residents. He took personal responsibility to complete the bridge and advised the engineering officials to ready the proposals. Subsequently, he got Rs.25 lakh from the MP grant and managed to adjust the remaining funds from the ZP grant and DMF.District panchayat officer Rambabu said that the new bridge would ensure the proper drainage of water, thereby preventing the recurring issue of flooded crop fields.The foundation stone for the bridge was laid in March, marking the beginning of a project that symbolizes progress and community spirit. As the bridge nears completion, the residents of the five local villages express their joy and relief, anticipating safer and more efficient travel. This bridge is not just an infrastructural development, but it is a testament to what can be achieved when community needs are prioritized, and government officials, like district collector Himanshu Shukla, act with foresight and dedication. “The ""Himanshu Shukla Rama Setu"" stands as a beacon of progress, enhancing the quality of life for thousands and paving the way for future developments in the region,” said local villager Venkateswara Rao. ""I owe a lot to the people.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
