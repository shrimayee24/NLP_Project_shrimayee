NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday asked all chief electoral officers (CEOs) — particularly of states/UTs due for assembly polls next year — to start training booth level officers (BLOs) and urge the political parties to appoint adequate number of booth level agents (BLAs) ahead of the impending announcement of a staggered, pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of their electoral rolls.These directions were given by EC on the concluding day of CEOs conference — presided over by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar in the presence of election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi. The Commission on Thursday also held separate, one-on-one interactions with the CEOs of the five poll-bound states/UT — Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam and Puducherry -- to understand any issues unique to them.The SIR process in these states/UT and a few others to be covered in the initial phase, is likely to stretch over three months, culminating with the publication of their final roll in January end or start of February.Having heard all CEOs at the two-day conference, on the progress of mapping of their electors with the roll published after the last intensive revision undertaken in 2003-2004 and also having clarified their queries on the SIR process, EC is set to hold internal deliberations over the next couple of days to finalise the pan-India SIR schedule.As reported by TOI on Wednesday, EC may announce the nationwide SIR exercise — covering the five poll-bound states/UT and a few others in the initial phase — within the next 3-4 days.Elaborating on the need for CEOs to start training BLOs immediately, a senior EC official said: “BLOs are a crucial link in the implementation of SIR”. The officer added that BLOs shall be updated on the processes to be followed, including distribution of enumeration forms and aiding the electors to sign and submit them, either physically or online. The mandatory requirement of making three visits to the electors’ addresses shall be emphasised during their daylong training.Also, given that EC is keen to hold the pan-India SIR with full involvement of the political parties, it has directed the state/UT CEOs to engage with the parties and encourage them to appoint BLAs. These BLAs may also be trained on aspects of SIR.Sources said it was explained to CEOs that any elector in their state/UT can easily be mapped with the 2003/04 roll of any state/UT as rolls of all states/UTs are now available in a digitised form.",Election Commission on Thursday asked all chief electoral officers (CEOs) to start training booth level officers (BLOs) EC is set to hold internal deliberations over the next couple of days to finalise the pan-India SIR schedule.

Toxic air in their metros made them pollution refugees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toxic-air-in-their-metros-made-them-pollution-refugees/articleshow/124774617.cms,"Amid increasing pollution in metros, especially after Diwali, couples are finding fresh beginnings in Goa, where clean air and blue skies promise a healthier future for them and their children

Delhi’s Air Quality Deteriorates Sharply to ‘Red Zone’ as Diwali Fireworks Trigger Severe Pollution

Last Oct, hotelier Ankit Gupta flew to Delhi from Panaji to celebrate Diwali with his parents in Maharani Bagh, an upscale residential area in South-East Delhi. Within hours, he developed a sinus infection. Ten days later, he remained on medication, struggling with respiratory problems.“Every friend of mine in Delhi is suffering from some form of respiratory illness,” Gupta said.Gupta, his wife Meenakshi Rajput (45) and 10-year-old daughter had moved to Goa in Jan 2024 after repeated bouts of respiratory problems left them scrambling for sanity, amid repeated visits to doctors’ chambers.Families that uprooted themselves from Delhi to settle in Goa — with great reluctance at first — are glad they made the shift.Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) on Diwali touched 345, in the ‘very poor’ category — the highest since 2021, when it had reached 382. Toxic smoke caused PM2.5 levels to soar to 675 micrograms per cubic metre at midnight, again the worst since 2021.PM2.5, or particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, are tiny airborne particles that pose significant health risks when inhaled.Because of how small they are, they can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma, coughing, breathing difficulties, and increased risk of conditions like lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.Mumbai, too, saw a sharp rise, with AQI levels up 9% on Diwali, compared to the night before.“Our respiratory issues were getting worse,” said Gupta. “We had chronic bouts of respiratory illness after every Diwali. Given our health concerns, we had no choice but to move. My daughter developed an adenoid infection because of respiratory illness and we had to get them surgically removed. We were asked by our doctors to go to a cleaner area. Delhi is like a gas chamber.”For Prashant Kalra and his wife, their decision to relocate was driven by concern about their daughter’s health. He put up a post on Instagram recently, explaining why — as a responsible father and a husband — he took the seemingly “reckless” decision. His post soon went viral, with many joining in and sharing their own reasons for leaving Gurugram and Delhi.“We were on a road trip in 2018, around Diwali,” Kalra said. “We were headed to a boutique hotel in Rajasthan to escape the Diwali pollution. While on that trip, our very boutiquey hotel decided to have a Diwali firework display, which prompted a coughing bout from our daughter. At that point, we decided that the north was no longer going to be home, and that a relocation was unavoidable.”In 2019, the Kalras made the journey south, seeking refuge in Goa, where the air was free from toxic smog.“Young parents like us are looking for cleaner air for our kids,” Kalra explained. “The main challenges are giving up work, the social circle, the convenience of a big city, the fear of the unknown and similar issues. But increasingly, there are parents who just don’t have a choice as their kids are getting sicker each year.”Gupta and Kalra are part of a growing tribe of Indian parents fleeing the deadly air pollution that envelops the country’s metros. These ‘pollution refugees’ have found that Goa’s palm-tinged villages and sunny climes are kinder to their lungs.On Aug 6, 2022, four-year-old Damian (name changed) lay gasping for breath at Hiranandani Hospital in Powai, an upscale suburb in Central Mumbai. His fretful parents watched their son, his face dwarfed by the oxygen mask that was helping his lungs.Midnight visits to the emergency room had become routine for Damian’s parents. This was not the first time that they had seen doctors pump steroids and medicines into the wiry frame of their boy. But it would be the last, they decided.“We realised that this was the tipping point for us,” said Damian’s father, Lionel. “Our company was going remote and there was nothing keeping us in Mumbai any more.”Musician Stefan Kaye and his wife were in the same boat. Their move away from the national capital began with the search for suitable schools for their three-year old daughter.“It got to a stage where we were checking schools to see if they had air purifiers in every room and if the children were made to exercise outdoors or indoors. There were serious ramifications for her health and we were dissatisfied with the facilities that schools had to counter the effects of pollution,” Kaye said.The Kayes could feel their eyes stinging in Delhi because of the toxins in the air. “There used to be a yellow haze, and we always had a burning sensation at the back of our throat. This can take years of your life,” said Kaye, who now lives in Goa.According to the India State Level Disease Burden Initiative study published in The Lancet, one out of every eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution. The study says that the average life expectancy in India would have been 1.7 years higher, had the air pollution level been less than the minimal level causing health loss.The ambient air quality in Delhi dances between hazardous and very severe. A deadly cocktail of construction dust, vehicular emissions and ash from crop burning chokes the national capital region, which fumes from firecrackers only exacerbates.“We moved to Goa because the health of our daughter was a real concern. As parents, we felt that it was irresponsible to raise a child and almost negligent in a way to live in Delhi,” Kaye said.","Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) on Diwali touched 345, in the ‘very poor’ category.

"To err is human, courts shouldn’t shy away from rectifying error: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-err-is-human-courts-shouldnt-shy-away-from-rectifying-error-sc/articleshow/124773549.cms,"NEW DELHI: Admitting judges can also commit mistakes as they are human, SC said courts should not shy away from accepting them and rectifying errors if committed.The maxim ‘actus curiae neminem gravabit’, which means the act of the court shall prejudice no one, is a principle firmly embedded in Indian jurisprudence and no party should suffer owing to an error, delay or inadvertence attributable to the court itself, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said.It said the maxim thus operates as a constant reminder that the court’s authority must be exercised not to the disadvantage of litigants but in furtherance of justice. “After all, to err is human, and when an inadvertent omission is brought to the court’s attention, it becomes the court’s solemn duty to ensure that no party suffers on account of such mistakes. In such circumstances, the court is obliged to restore the party to the very position he would have occupied had the error not occurred,” the bench said.SC accepted there was an omission on its part, wherein it did not clarify in its judgment that possession of a building in Chandigarh would be handed over upon receipt of amount awarded by it. Taking advantage of its omission, an “unscrupulous litigant” refused to hand over the possession of the building despite being paid Rs 2 crore as directed by the apex court.In this case, the litigant had agreed to buy the property in 1989, paid an advance of Rs 25,000 and took possession of the property.But soon litigation started and the property’s ownership could not be transferred to him. Thirty-nine years down the line, SC brought the litigation to an end by directing he should be paid Rs 2 crore in lieu of the earnest money of Rs 25,000 that was paid in 1989. However, SC, while delivering its judgment, did not mention that he, in turn, had to hand over the possession of the property to its owner. This led to a fresh round litigation as the owner approached trial court and then Punjab and Haryana HC, which granted order in his favour.The apex court upheld the order passed by the courts and imposed a cost of Rs 10 lakh on the “unscrupulous litigant” — the buyer.","SC accepted there was an omission on its part, wherein it did not clarify in its judgment that possession of a building in Chandigarh would be handed over upon receipt of amount awarded by it.

""They are going to stop..."" Trump Reiterates Claim That India Is Cutting Down Russian Oil Imports





NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports after the US on Wednesday sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, the largest exporters of those barrels.Reliance, the single-largest Indian consumer of Russian oil, will be the biggest loser as it buys most of those barrels directly from Rosneft under a term contract. Russian crude makes up about half of the feed at the company's 35-million-tonne complex.“Recalibration of Russian oil imports is ongoing and Reliance will be fully aligned to GOI (Government of India) guidelines,” a Reliance spokesman told Reuters.The curbs on Rosneft will also make life harder for Nayara Energy, which is half owned by the Russian giant and struggling to stay afloat since September when the EU imposed sanctions. Analysts said selling products from its 20-million-tonne refinery at Gujarat's Vadinar will be tough.Importers can receive contracted shipments till November 21. Unlike previous sanctions, when Russian oil could be traded within the $60 price cap, this time the curbs are directed at the companies, making their barrel tainted after the cut-off date.So far this year, 36% of India’s crude has been from Russia, with Rosneft and Lukoil supplying nearly 60% of this.A senior executive of IndianOil, one of the largest consumers of Russian oil among state-run refiners, said those barrels make up 15-18% of their crude basket.“It is too early. We are looking at the fine print. But it will not be too difficult to arrange alternative supplies from West Asia or other geographies such as Africa, the US etc. But others will also be crowding those markets, which will jack up benchmark prices and premia on other crude. This will impact margins. But Russian oil somehow finds its way into the market as we have seen in the past… but banking issues may crop up,” he said.Sure enough, benchmark Brent crude price shot up 5%, or by $2.9 a barrel, to 65.50 on Thursday. ""The good thing is prices are in their 60s. Even if they rise to $70, it will be manageable.""US President Donald Trump has been mounting pressure on countries such as India and China to lower oil imports from Russia as part of a plan to squeeze Moscow to come to the negotiating table on the Ukraine conflict. Trump imposed secondary tariffs of 25% on India, in addition to 25% reciprocal tariffs, citing Russian crude purchases.Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hit back at the US. “This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia. But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure.” He said breaking the balance in the global energy markets could lead to a hike in prices that would be uncomfortable for countries such as the US.As a country, the loss of discounted Russian oil could potentially cost India, which meets 85% of its crude requirement through imports, an estimated annual savings of about $4-5 billion on its oil import bill. Ratings agency ICRA estimates that replacement supplies at market prices would increase the oil import bill by 2%, potentially impacting the macroeconomic parameters.Sumit Ritolia, analyst at global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler, said the term arrangement with Rosneft could “introduce some near-term friction, especially from a compliance standpoint for RIL. The company would understandably wish to avoid any exposure to OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) and it will need to look at its Russian crude strategy.”The immediate operational impact on state-run refiners, he said, ""should remain limited"" as they buy Russian crude through tender from third-party traders. “However, secondary sanctions related to logistics and financing could pose indirect challenges.”","Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (AoN) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (LPDs) Another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles -- with ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380-km -- for the S-400 Triumf air defence systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,imgsize-717429,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

"From rushing trains to crowd control, Railways uses real-time map to manage Chhath rush",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-rushing-trains-to-crowd-control-railways-uses-real-time-map-to-manage-chhath-rush/articleshow/124771994.cms,"Viral Video: IRCTC Staff Fight At Delhi’s Nizamuddin Station, 4 Suspended, Rs 5 Lakh Fine Imposed

NEW DELHI: To deal with the upcoming Chhath rush, the railways is using real-time heat-mapping of 35 major stations to monitor heavy passenger movement, rushing standby unreserved trains close to these stations to clear the surge of travellers and creating holding areas for crowd control. These measures are based on passenger data from the festive seasons of the past two years, including this Diwali.In a massive operation, the national transporter is set to run around 13,000 special services before and after the biggest festival of Bihar — nearly double than the number of trains operated last year — to ferry an estimated more than 2.5 crore passengers, similar to the population of Australia.Special trains are in addition to normal trains that the railways operates. Most of these trains are headed for poll-bound Bihar.The number of special trains was determined through analysis of past two years of data, which was fed into a model to assess the demand for each destination, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said. He added that micro monitoring is being done at three levels — divisional, zonal and at the Railway Board.Sources said that freight services on identified routes have been minimised to clear the rush and even Dedicated Freight Corridors are being used.Vaishnaw said on Oct 19 (a day before Diwali), there was a sudden surge of passengers at the Udhna station in Gujarat. “As soon as this started showing on the heat map, passengers were put in queue and a standby unreserved train in the vicinity was moved to clear the traffic build up,” he added. Officials said two special trains were operated from Udhna to Jayanagar in Bihar on that day to clear the rush.There was a similar situation at Ambala in Haryana on Tuesday and the railways followed suit to deal with the situation. “We have three categories — normal traffic, crowded situations and overcrowding. Once there are signs of overcrowding, the entire system moves swiftly to deal with the situation,” Vaishnaw said. He added that learning from earlier experiences, the railways increased the number of destinations in Bihar from 7-8 in 2024 to 28. “We identified the closest station for the convenience of passengers,” the minister said.Vaishnaw also said that the railways has issued orders for construction of permanent holding areas at 76 high footfall railway stations such as Mumbai, Howrah, Lucknow, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Chennai, and Patna, and Secunderabad, Bengaluru, Tirupati, and Ujjain, among others.","The railways is using real-time heat-mapping of 35 major stations to monitor heavy passenger movement.

BHOPAL: Diwali celebrations turned tragic in Madhya Pradesh when about 300 people, including children , suffered severe to minor eye injuries after they “fired” carbide guns, or agri-cannons, used mainly by farmers to scare away monkeys and birds, on Monday and Tuesday. As many as 30 of them are said to be serious and could lose their sight.Deputy CM Rajendra Shukla said, “A review meeting was called as soon as we got to know. Seven children were seriously injured in Bhopal and admitted in Hamidia hospital, some in Gwalior and Vidisha.Carbide guns have a mixture of calcium carbide, matchstick heads, and gunpowder, officials said. While adding water to calcium carbide generates acetylene gas, ignition creates powerful explosions that result in intense heat, noxious gases, and projectiles. Unofficial reports suggested 300 cases of varying degrees of “alkali injury”, which can cause permanent damage.Doctors at AIIMS-Bhopal said there were two primary types of injury to the eye — acid and alkali. While acid injuries tend to be less severe due to limited penetration, alkali injuries are significantly dangerous.“Alkali eye injuries cause irreversible damage and treatment focuses on preventing further deterioration.In some cases, vision loss may occur. Of the patients admitted to AIIMS-Bhopal, only one has sustained injuries in both eyes,” said Dr Bhavana Sharma, head of department of ophthalmology at AIIMS-Bhopal.While most of the cases were reported from Bhopal and a few neighbouring districts and were being treated in hospitals here, about 50 were reported from Gwalior and Jabalpur.Bhopal chief medical and health officer Dr Manish Sharma said there were 13 patients at AIIMS-Bhopal and 12 at Gandhi Medical College on Thursday. One critical case was sent to AIIMS-Delhi. The others were discharged. He said 15 in Bhopal underwent surgical procedure.Nearly three dozen cases were reported from Bhopal while additional patients were referred from neighbouring Vidisha and Hoshangabad districts. While about 150 patients were treated in Bhopal, many were being treated in district hospitals, he added.Officials said carbide guns, marketed online as “PVC monkey repeller gun”, emerged as alternatives to traditional fireworks.Authorities identified the issue two weeks before Diwali and implemented curbs. Govt had also put a ban on its sale and use. The devices, priced between Rs 150 and Rs 200, were marketed as entertainment items in the open market while their price ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 on e-commerce platforms.Police on Thursday seized at least 42 carbide guns being sold on the roadside, along with 1.5kg of calcium carbide explosives. A vendor was arrested and booked under Section 288 of BNS. He was later released on bail.Despite restrictions, e-commerce platforms continued to offer carbide-based cannons.","As many as 30 of them are said to be serious and could lose their sight.

Muslim representation shrinks sharply





NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for the assembly elections, the ruling National Democratic Alliance and the opposition Mahagathbandhan have cornered each other over issues such as development, migration, and unemployment. However, it all appears to have boiled down to the perennial theme of caste-based politics, with every party fine-tuning its manifesto and candidate list to gauge how various caste communities will vote and how best to retain their traditional voter bases.Swearing by Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur’s legacy of social justice, a caste survey was conducted in Bihar in 2023 to determine the exact population of each caste, aiming to bolster demands for expanded quotas.The survey found that the EBCs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent, which amounts to 63 per cent of the total 13.07 crore population of the state; together, they constitute the socially hefty segment of backward classes. Meanwhile, the “upper caste” groups among Hindus account for only 10.6 per cent.However, the caste proportions seem unlikely to be reflected in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha after the results, as parties appear to be prioritising their traditional voter bases and other factors over population-based representation during the screening of candidates.In the upcoming assembly elections, parties have not only fielded candidates from dominant castes to strengthen their poll prospects but have also calibrated diverse caste combinations to counter caste hegemony across regions.Under the seat-sharing deal between NDA partners, BJP was allotted 101 seats. Riding on the vote banks of the upper castes, BJP gave 49 tickets (48.5%) to upper-caste candidates. Meanwhile, 34 candidates (33.7%) from the OBC community were fielded, including 6 Yadavs, 15 Vaishyas, 7 Kushwahas, and 2 Kurmis.Only 10 EBC candidates (9.9%) and 12 SC candidates (11.9%) are in the poll fray with BJP's symbol.Interestingly, BJP had fielded only 16 Yadavs in 2020 assembly elections. The choice of BJP’s replacements for some of its sitting Yadav MLAs points to its new gameplan: it has gone for a Kushwaha, the most populous OBC community after Yadavs; a Nishad, an increasingly assertive extremely backward classes group; and a Vaishya, the party's traditional supporter, for the Patna Sahib, Aurai and Munger seats, respectively.Chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) has fielded the most candidates from the OBC, EBC, and SC communities.Nitish, who has positioned himself as the poster boy of non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs, has fielded 37 candidates from the OBC community (36.6%) and 22 candidates from the EBC community (21.8%).Additionally, 15 candidates from the SC community (14.9%) and 1 candidate from the ST community (1.0%) are in the poll fray. JD(U) has also distributed tickets to 22 (21.8%) candidates from the upper-caste community in the upcoming assembly elections.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which was allotted 29 seats under the seat-sharing, has fielded five candidates each from the Rajput and Yadav castes, and four each from Paswan and Bhumihar communities.Meanwhile, Chirag Paswan fielded one candidate each from Brahmin, Teli, Pasi, Sudhi, Rauniyar, Kanu, Rajwar, Dhobi, Kushwaha, Ravidas, and Muslim communities.Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha has fielded six candidates in the poll fray. Out of the six candidates, the party has fielded four of Manjhi’s relatives and two Bhumihar candidates.Meanwhile, Upendra Kushwaha 's Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) fielded one Bhumihar, one Rajput, three Kushwahas, and one Vaishya candidate.Catering to its traditional vote banks of Yadavs and Muslims, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has distributed tickets to 51 Yadavs out of 143 seats. The party has also fielded candidates from upper-caste and EBC communities. With Mahagathbandhan parties contesting a total of 255 seats, several constituencies are witnessing “friendly fights” among alliance partners.In total, the RJD has fielded 18 Kurmi-Kushwaha, 51 Yadavs, 8 Vaishyas, 14 upper castes, 33 EBCs, 19 SCs, and 18 Muslims in the upcoming elections.Contesting on 61 seats, the Congress has fielded nearly one-third—21 candidates—from upper-caste communities. The party’s lineup also includes 5 Yadavs, 6 EBCs, 3 Vaishyas, and 12 SC candidates.CPM-L has put forward 3 Koeris, 2 Yadavs, 1 Rajput, 1 EBC, 6 SCs, and 1 Muslim, aiming to make inroads in key constituencies.Muskesh Sahni's VIP is contesting on 15 seats with 3 Yadav, 1 Kurmi-Kushwaha, 2 Upper caste, 1 SC and 8 EBC candidates to target specific voter groups.CPM has fielded 1 Koeri, 1 Yadav, and 1 SC candidate for the upcoming assembly elections.CPI has nominated 2 Yadavs, 1 Bhumihar, and 3 SC candidates to contest in the polls.IIP has fielded 1 Vaishya and 1 EBC candidate for the elections.Muslim representation in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections has seen a noticeable decline, particularly within the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Janata Dal (United), the only NDA constituent to field Muslim candidates — has given tickets to just four Muslim contenders this time, compared to 14 in the previous election.The move is being seen as chief minister Nitish Kumar’s acknowledgment that the community’s support has largely shifted towards the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).On the opposition side, RJD has fielded 18 Muslim candidates, staying true to its traditional Yadav-Muslim base, while the Congress has allotted tickets to 10 Muslim aspirants.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","Bihar's caste politics appears to have boiled down to the perennial theme of caste-based politics.

Court junks ‘frivolous’ Ayodhya verdict plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-junks-frivolous-ayodhya-verdict-plea/articleshow/124772227.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed lawyer Mehmood Pracha’s plea seeking to declare Supreme Court ’s 2019 Ayodhya judgment “null and void”, calling it a “frivolous and luxurious” attempt to misuse the legal system. District judge Dharmender Rana not only upheld a Rs 1 lakh penalty imposed by a civil court but also added Rs 5 lakh more to “deter” similar cases.Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict had unanimously awarded the disputed site to the deity Ram Lalla Virajman for temple construction, while granting Muslims a separate five-acre plot in Ayodhya to build a mosque.Pracha had filed the suit after alleging that former CJI DY Chandrachud publicly said in Pune that the Ayodhya judgment reflected a “solution provided by Bhagwan Shri Ram Lala Virajman”. He said this amounted to fraud and sought a fresh adjudication of the case.Judge Rana rejected the claim outright, observing that “seeking guidance from the almighty cannot be berated as a fraudulent act to gain unfair advantage, either in law or in any religion”. Quoting Hindu and Islamic scriptures, he said “Aham Brahma Asmi” embodies unity with the divine, and even the Quran allows devotees to seek guidance from Allah.Calling Pracha’s petition an “abuse of the process of law”, the judge said the lawyer’s insistence on impleading the former CJI “soon after his retirement” revealed an “oblique intent”. He said Pracha had challenged the verdict “without even bothering to go through it” and had no standing since he was not a party to the Ayodhya case.“The already overburdened dockets of the court cannot afford the menace of luxurious and frivolous litigation,” Judge Rana said. He warned of a growing trend where “unscrupulous litigants” target public officials after they leave office, adding that courts must ensure a “peaceful and pleasant evening” to those who served the nation. “The situation becomes distressful when the protector himself turns predator,” the judge remarked. “In this case, the appellant, despite being a fairly senior counsel, has opted to choose the wrong colour of jersey. Instead of participating in the solution, he has opted to augment the problem.”Judge Rana said both courts and the legal fraternity must act as sentinels to “sieve out impurities at the entry gates themselves”, underscoring the need to “deal with such litigation with an iron hand”.",A Delhi court has dismissed lawyer Mehmood Pracha’s plea seeking to declare Supreme Court ’s 2019 Ayodhya judgment “null and void” Judge Dharmender Rana called it a “frivolous and luxurious’ attempt to misuse the legal system.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124772225,imgsize-744366,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

One of the criteria in the alternative system would be that students must qualify for the JEE Advanced exam, either on the common rank list or category-wise list.“The Senate, in principle, approved that from the next academic session, we will be admitting students through alternate routes without disturbing the primary channel of admission through JEE Advanced. The institute is exploring different possibilities — like Sports Excellence Admission (SEA) and Science Olympiad Excellence Admissions (SCOPE) — as a benchmark of acceptance. But the final modalities are yet to be finalised,” said director Suman Chakraborty. “One of the criteria will be that students must qualify for the JEE Advanced exam, but their ranks should not be a deciding factor,” he added.Chakraborty felt the main purpose of the initiative was to make the admission process inclusive and attract a diverse range of students.Several IITs — like IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Gandhinagar, and IIT Indore — offer admission through Olympiad and sports excellence pathways in addition to the standard JEE route.“A committee will be formed with representatives from each department to fix the modalities and oversee the implementation of this pathway of admission.

Getting an opportunity to attend the training camp of an Olympiad is itself an impressive achievement and reflects on the academic preparation of the students. The idea is to recognise academic excellence beyond the conventional entrance exams,” an official said.In case of admission through SEA, it has been proposed that candidates must obtain at least one medal in the last four years from sports achievements in any national or international-level competitions, a source said.

MEERUT: Roshni (name changed) was 15 when her life was ruined by a man who threw acid on her for breaking off their engagement. She lost an eye and her face was disfigured. It was 1997. What followed were years of pain and trauma, along with a series of corrective surgeries amid huge financial distress. Now, after 28 years of wait, Roshni, 43, received Rs 5 lakh in “compensation” — Rs 1 lakh from PM’s National Relief Fund and Rs 4 lakh from UP govt, reports Sandeep Rai.“That the interim compensation was released after 28 years shows the fragile state of affairs. Her monthly expenses on medicines and psychological therapy is close to Rs 10,000...” said Shaheen Malik, herself an acid attack survivor who had been fighting Roshni’s case since last year. She plans to move HC to seek “adequate compensation”.On Oct 28, 1997, Roshni was attacked at her Shahjahanpur home. She suffered extensive burns to her face, head and neck, resulting in almost 45% permanent physical disability. Thereafter, costly medicines and surgeries took a heavy financial toll on her family.“My father was a tailor and mother a housewife. My family was totally shattered; I was bedridden for two years. They exhausted all their savings and had to depend on community donations for my treatment. .. The surgeries cost over Rs 10 lakh,” Roshni said.Her trauma wasn’t just about the scars, anxiety and depression. In the next few years, she lost her parents, while her siblings moved on with their lives, leaving her all by herself.“My father passed away a few years later and my mother had to do odd jobs to keep me alive. The cost of medicines was enormous. Sadly, my mother died about eight years ago. I’m currently jobless and my frailty refuses to go away,” added Roshni, who also did odd jobs at various houses and later resorted to work on sarees, largely patchwork, from home.It was only last year that she found active support from Malik’s Delhi-based NGO Brave Souls Foundation. “Unfortunately, back in the 90s, the survivor’s family had little awareness about compensation. The prolonged delay in granting financial support reflects authorities’ lack of responsibility and accountability. Despite having knowledge of the gruesome attack, they left the victim unaware of available schemes and procedures,” Malik said. Roshni currently stays at a women’s shelter run by the NGO.“After 28 years of spending lakhs on her treatment, she got Rs 5 lakh. We are in the process of filing a suit to get her at least Rs 50 lakh,” Malik said. Officials from Shahjahanpur administration were unavailable for comment.","Roshni (name changed) was 15 when her life was ruined by a man who threw acid on her for breaking off their engagement.

NEW DELHI: India may soon adopt stricter rules for power banks on board aircraft following recent instances worldwide, including one in the country, of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.On Sunday, a passenger’s power bank caught fire on a Dimapur-bound IndiGo flight when the aircraft was taxiing at Delhi airport. Now, Directorate General of Civil Aviation is “taking up this issue”, said a senior official.The regulator is learnt to be taking technical inputs on the issue. Foreign airlines are increasingly putting restrictions on power banks. Some require the power bank to be kept in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front and not in overhead bins.From Oct 1, Dubai-based Emirates “prohibited” use any power bank. While it allows a passenger to carry one power bank under 100 Watt Hours, they can neither use it to charge a device, nor charge the power bank in the aircraft cabin. The new regulations also mandate that “all power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available”.Most phones and sophisticated lithium battery-powered devices have an internal trickle system that slowly adds current into the battery to prevent overcharging, but many basic power banks may not have this safeguard.Singapore Airlines from April 1 did not allow flyers to charge power banks via onboard USB ports, or use them to charge their devices.Last week, there was a lithium battery fire on an Air China flight from China to South Korea, forcing it to be diverted to Shanghai.",A passenger’s power bank caught fire on a Dimapur-bound IndiGo flight when the aircraft was taxiing at Delhi airport.

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University.

BENGALURU: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is expected to submit its expert report on Bengaluru’s second international airport within the next two or three days, said industries and infrastructure development minister MB Patil Thursday.The AAI team had inspected two potential sites — one along Kanakapura Road in Bengaluru South and one near NelamangalaKunigal Road in Bengaluru Rural — in April. “Once we receive the report, it will be discussed by the cabinet before a final decision is taken,” Patil said.He indicated AAI may recommend both sites it examined. “But airport construction companies will also evaluate the financial feasibility of the proposed locations,” he said. Insisting that the process would not be arbitrary, Patil said, “It’s not that they will build an airport wherever the govt allots land.”He explained that the govt had initiated preliminary steps keeping in mind an existing clause that bars launching another international airport within a 150km radius of Kempe-gowda International Airport (KIA) until 2033.“If we begin the groundwork now, the second international airport will be ready by then.A project of this scale typically takes a minimum of five to six years to complete,” he said. “Currently, only New Delhi (Noida) and Mumbai (Navi Mumbai) have two international airports.”He said Karnataka would consult developers of those airports for guidance, while admitting the govt is aware of Tamil Nadu’s plans to build an airport in Hosur, close to the Karnataka border. As for possible locations, Patil said legislators from North Karnataka have proposed Tumakuru, while others have suggested sites in South Bengaluru.“However, passenger density, industrial requirements, and several other factors will be taken into consideration. Ultimately, the decision will be made purely on merit, keeping in mind convenience and future demand,” the minister said.","The Airports Authority of India is set to submit its expert report on Bengaluru's second international airport within the next two or three days.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

The shootout occurred early Thursday morning after police flagged down their vehicle. The operation thwarted multiple planned killings ahead of elections in Bihar.

Gang extended influence to Jharkhand, UP too





NEW DELHI: Four notorious inter-state gangsters, including the chief of the infamous Sigma gang, were killed in a high-octane encounter with the Delhi Police's crime branch and Bihar police in Rohini.The shootout unfolded at 2.20am on Thursday when the cops flagged down a white Baleno, attracting heavy fire from the occupants. The cops shot back, leaving the criminals, including the kingpin Ranjan Pathak, dead.At least three policemen were shot at too but were saved due to their bulletproof vests. The operation averted a slew of killings in Delhi and Bihar ahead of assembly elections there, cops said. The gang - named Sigma & Company - had wreaked havoc by going on a killing spree in the last six months and at least six high-profile murders had left the cops from multiple units on edge. The gang was committing murders almost every month, prompting a manhunt. A reward of Rs 1 lakh was declared on them.Special CP (Crime) Devesh Srivastava told TOI that the operation was conducted on the inputs provided by Bihar police.A team led by DCP Sanjeev Yadav intercepted the gangsters, prompting an exchange of fire from them,"" he added. Around 40 rounds were exchanged, sources said.The injured criminals were immediately shifted to Ambedkar Hospital where they were declared brought dead by the doctors.Besides Ranjan (25), two others from Sitamarhi, Bihar - Manish Pathak (25) and Bimlesh Sahni (33) - were killed.The fourth accused, identified as Aman Thakur (21), was from Karawal Nagar in northeast Delhi. Originally from Sheohar district in Bihar, he had been sheltering the gang-members and helping them set up a base in the city, police said. After a contract was received by the gang, Thakur would allegedly travel with Ranjan and others and carry out the killing. The cops are now looking for other gang members.Ranjan, cops said, had become a significant challenge for law enforcement due to his habit of being constantly on the move after a crime. The Sigma gang operated mainly in Bihar but had of late extended its influence across Jharkhand, UP, and even the Nepal border areas. At 25 , Pathak had risen quickly as a feared gangster responsible for several high-profile killings and violent crimes.The dossier of these criminals details a slew of crimes they were allegedly involved in. ""Ranjan was named as accused in around a dozen cases of extortion, murder and attempted murders. He had recently demanded Rs 45 lakh extortion and threatened to kill a well-known businessman. They are also accused of killing a bank Mitra official, a former president of Brahmarishi Sena, and others, in different incidents,"" joint CP Surendra Kumar said.The gang had also shot dead a trader in Sitamarhi and critically injured another last month. ""Another contract killing was executed a few months ago in which a man named Madan Kumar Kushwah was chased and shot five times near a railway post. Thakur has four FIRs filed against him,"" DCP Yadav said.In Sheohar district, Pathak and his gang killed a man named Guddu Jha in daylight.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Bengaluru: Setting the tone for an expansion of the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA), deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar said Thursday that the neighbouring semi-urban and industrialised part of Anekal in Bengaluru Urban district will be added to its limits in the coming days.However, the Bengaluru development minister did not disclose any timeframe for the inclusion of additional areas into GBA's limits.Visiting Muthanallur and adjoining areas as part of his inspection of CMC, TMC, and taluk panchayat areas that will possibly be added to the GBA limits, Shivakumar said, ""All amenities, including Cauvery water, are being provided to these areas. In the coming days, the Anekal region will be included in GBA limits. I have inspected areas under the urban local bodies of Bengaluru Urban district that are eligible to be included into GBA limits. I have called for a meeting Friday to discuss with officials the facilities to be provided to the region in the coming days.""The DyCM revealed that a committee, led by BS Patil, is preparing a report on the possible addition of new areas into GBA limits. ""The committee has been asked to hold interactions with the MLAs, MPs, resident welfare associations and the general public.This weekend I will interact with the public during the Walk for Bengaluru programme and subsequently, a special meeting will be held with the representatives of IT and BT companies, especially those that are based out of Mahadevapura and KR Pura region,"" Shivakumar clarified.Stating that about 2.5 million people reside outside of Bengaluru municipal limits, Shivakumar said, ""Areas such as Electronics City, Whitefield, Airport Road and parts of Yelahanka still remain as panchayats. Wherever urbanisation has increased, we need to plan systematically. While the garbage is cleared in some areas, it is left unattended in some other localities as they are under panchayat limits. Hence, accountability shall be fixed on officials. ""Why talk about potholes on these roads?The DyCM also toured the roads leading to Biocon and Infosys companies, off the Hosur Road. When asked whether he spotted any potholes and garbage piled up on these roads, Shivakumar replied, ""Biocon firm is located within panchayat limits. The Bengaluru city limits and panchayat limits are entirely different. I have already spoken about this. Why talk about it again now? But I have seen those areas myself.""Referring to the fast-approaching deadline to fill up potholes across Bengaluru, Shivakumar said, ""Our engineers are working throughout the day to fill up potholes.

MUMBAI: A 35-year-old man, termed as a coordinator for a drug syndicate, against whom a red corner notice (RCN) was issued in the Rs 252 crore Mephedrone or MD seizure case in the city last year, was deported from the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday.Mohammed Saleem Shaikh was arrested upon his arrival in Mumbai, and a court sent him to police custody till Oct 30. Shaikh, originally from South Mumbai, was also known as 'Saleem Lavish' for reportedly having a lavish lifestyle. He is the third accused to be deported from Dubai this year in connection with the same drug case. Earlier in June, Tahir Saleem Dola and Mustaffa Kubbawala were deported from Dubai and arrested. So far, 15 accused, including a woman, have been arrested in this case.Last year, the crime branch busted a factory where banned MD drugs were being manufactured in Sangli. Shaikh was the coordinator for this factory. ""He supplied the raw material for preparing drugs, and later, when the drug was ready, he arranged its transportation to the peddlers at various places. He was in Dubai and would coordinate everything from there,"" said DCP Vishal Thakur of the crime branch.He added that Shaikh was in Dubai for the past two years and was connected to the peddlers across India.Cops are also examining if Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA) can be invoked against the accused in this case.

Who is Najah Al Masaeed?





How the Najah Al Masaeed $7 million scam unfolded?

“Justice for Najah” trends across the arab world

Financial scam trends in the MENA region

Jordanian authorities launch investigation





The Arab world was left stunned this week after Emirati-Jordanian poet and television personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed that she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam, losing what she described as a “very large sum” of money. In a tearful video shared across her social media accounts, Najah said she had been deceived by individuals she trusted deeply, describing the ordeal as a calculated act of fraud rather than a spontaneous theft. The revelation ignited a wave of support and outrage across the Middle East, with fans, journalists, and fellow artists calling for justice and stronger protections against organized scams targeting public figures.Born in Al Mafraq, Jordan, in 1977, Najah Al Masaeed became one of the most influential female voices in Arabic poetry. She gained fame for her emotionally charged verses and eloquent performances, earning admiration from the late King Hussein of Jordan, who offered her a scholarship after she recited a poem in his presence.Najah studied Sociology at Mutah University, becoming one of the few women of her generation to pursue higher education.Her boldness and intellect led her to become a prominent media presenter, poet, and cultural figure, later acquiring Emirati nationality in recognition of her artistic contributions.Over the years, she became a symbol of female empowerment in Arab arts, inspiring countless young women to pursue literature and public life without fear.In her emotional confession, Najah disclosed that she had been the victim of a well-planned fraud that cost her a staggering five million Jordanian dinars (approximately USD 7 million). Though she did not name the perpetrators, Najah made it clear that the scam was perpetrated by someone she personally trusted, likely linked to a business or investment venture “It’s not a small amount. I was deceived in a way that broke my heart and faith in people,” she said in a viral video.According to reports from Youm7 and Al-Mashhad, Najah has filed a formal complaint and initiated legal proceedings to recover her stolen funds. The case is currently being investigated by Jordanian authorities. Sources close to the poet indicated that the scheme involved false investment promises and manipulated documents, convincing Najah to transfer large sums over time.The case quickly became a social media storm, with hashtags like #JusticeForNajah, #NajahAlMasaeedScam, and #ArabCelebrityFraud trending across Jordan and the UAE. Prominent Arab influencers and writers publicly voiced support, urging authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable and applauding Najah for her transparency.According to recent reports from regional financial crime authorities and cybersecurity firms, financial scams targeting high-net-worth individuals and public figures in the MENA region have risen by over 25% in the past three years. In 2024 alone, the Jordanian Anti-Fraud Authority reported losses exceeding JD 120 million (approx. USD 170 million) due to investment, digital banking, and trust-based scams, while UAE authorities cited over AED 500 million in reported fraud cases, a significant portion involving celebrities or public personalities. Most scams involved real estate, online investments, and false consultancy schemes, with an average individual loss of JD 250,000–500,000. Najah Al Masaeed’s estimated loss of JD 5 million (USD 7 million) thus places her among the largest publicly reported cases of celebrity-targeted financial fraud in recent years, highlighting both the sophistication of modern scams and the vulnerability even high-profile figures face.According to early reports, the Jordanian Public Security Directorate has begun examining Najah’s complaint, focusing on banking transactions, digital communications, and contractual documents related to the alleged fraud. Legal analysts say the investigation may expand internationally if the suspects or funds are traced outside Jordan.Under Jordanian law, financial deception and breach of trust can carry severe penalties, including prison sentences and asset confiscation. If the suspects are found guilty, the court could order the restitution of Najah’s funds through asset recovery mechanisms. Najah’s lawyer, whose name has not been disclosed publicly, is reportedly working with financial crime experts to trace the missing money and identify all those involved.The Najah Al Masaeed fraud case combines heartbreak, betrayal, and courage in equal measure. It’s not just a story about losing millions, it's about how trust, money, and fame can collide in today’s interconnected global world. Her emotional honesty has made people listen. Her next steps legally and personally could define not only her legacy, but how Arab media and public figures handle financial fraud and increasing accountability in the digital age.","Emirati-Jordanian poet and TV personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam.

Sanae Takaichi made history on Tuesday, winning Japan’s parliamentary vote to become the nation’s first female prime minister. Her victory was met with enthusiasm in domestic stock markets.Takaichi secured 237 votes in the first round in the 465-seat Lower House, eliminating the need for a runoff, according to public broadcaster NHK.Her election follows a weekend agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party to form a coalition government.Takaichi will succeed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political deadlock following the Liberal Democratic Party's poor showing in the July elections. Ishiba, who served only one year, resigned along with his Cabinet earlier Tuesday, clearing the way for his successor.“Political stability is essential right now,” Takaichi said at Monday’s signing ceremony with JIP leader and Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura. “Without stability, we cannot push measures for a strong economy or diplomacy.”A candidate who secures a simple majority in both the lower and upper houses of parliament is elected prime minister.If no candidate achieves this, a run-off is held between the two with the most votes from the first round. In the run-off, the candidate with the most votes wins, even without a majority, as cited by Reuters.If the two chambers disagree, the lower house’s decision takes precedence.After being elected prime minister, Takaichi is expected to form a Cabinet including several allies of LDP kingmaker Taro Aso and other supporters from the party leadership vote.Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have opposed measures for women’s advancement.

Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.
