Poll Do you think the safety measures on flights are adequate? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, AI was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, AI said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

NEW DELHI: Those who violate traffic and other motor vehicle (MV) rules will soon be required to either accept and pay challans or contest them with supporting evidence within 45 days, says a draft notification proposing amendments to the MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.As per the proposed changes notified by the road transport ministry, regional transport offices (RTOs) won’t process any applications related to the licence or vehicle registration of such offenders until the dues are cleared. Such vehicles and driving licence holders will also be flagged as “not to be transacted” on Vahan and Sarathi portal.Sources said these changes have been proposed to nudge violators to clear their dues.However, experts cautioned that, before implementing the changes, the govt must ensure that systems are in place for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) holders to raise objections against challans, and for their names to be promptly removed from the pending payment list once the dues are cleared.“The draft rules specify that anyone receiving a challan may contest it on the portal with supporting documentary evidence before an authority designated by the respective state govt.There is a need to clearly define the responsibilities of this authority, and there should be a penalty provision in place if the authority fails to remove a vehicle or individual from the defaulter list after dues have been cleared,” said a veteran from the transport industry.The ministry has proposed that police officers in uniform or any other official authorised by state govts be allowed to issue challan physically. They could also auto-generate challans. These challans must be delivered either in person within 15 days or electronically within three days.If a person does not contest a challan before the designated authority, it will be deemed accepted 45 days after issuance.According to the draft rules, if a challan is contested and the authority fails to resolve it within 30 days, or if it decides to quash the challan with recorded reasons, the penalty will no longer be enforceable.The petitioner may either accept the order and pay the fine within 30 days of it being uploaded on the portal or file an application before a court after depositing 50 per cent of the penalty amount. If the individual neither pays the fine nor contests the challan in court within 30 days of receiving the order, the challan will be deemed accepted.",Road transport ministry proposes changes to MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.

The court set Oct 13 as the final deadline.One week’s time is granted to the petitioners to file a correct amended cause title deleting the prefix Maharaj and Princess from the names of the petitioners and respondent, Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal said on Friday.Failure to comply, the court warned, would mean automatic dismissal “without reference to the court”.The directive came while hearing petitions filed in 2001 by legal heirs of late Jagat Singh and Prithviraj Singh, descendants of the erstwhile Jaipur royal family, challenging the collection of house tax by municipal authorities.The judge questioned the relevance of royal honorifics in today’s republic, pointing out that princely privileges were abolished decades ago. The court asked bluntly why such titles should continue to appear in legal proceedings.In Jan 2022, the Jaipur bench raised similar objections in a related case, seeking responses from both the Union and Rajasthan governments over the continued use of royal designations.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is going for emergency acquisition of six mobile AK-630 multi-barrel air defence gun systems, in what is another step towards protecting population centres from hostile drones, loiter munitions, rockets and mortars along the border with Pakistan.The procurement tender for the 30mm gun systems, which have an effective range of 4-6 km, has been issued to defence PSU Advance Weapon and Equipment India Ltd (AWEIL). ""The contract will be inked under the fast-track emergency procurement mechanism approved after Operation Sindoor. More such guns, which act as close-in weapon systems because of their high rate of fire, will be ordered at a later stage,"" an officer said on Saturday.The AK-630 gun systems are mounted on trailers and towed by high-mobility vehicles, which offer flexibility and rapid deployment. The gun system is capable of a cyclic rate of fire up to 3,000 rounds per minute, which creates a wall of air defence shells to destroy approaching hostile aerial objects at close ranges.""It has an all-weather fire control system for target detection and engagement during day and night as well as adverse weather conditions.

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP), a pilots’ body, on Sunday called for a thorough inspection of the electrical systems of all Boeing 787 planes operating in India “in the interest of air safety. ”The FIP’s appeal to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) comes a day after an Air India Boeing 787 flight from Amritsar to Birmingham deployed emergency turbine power while preparing to land in the UK city. The incident, too, comes just months after another Air India Boeing 787 operating between India and the UK (Ahmedabad-London) crashed minutes after take-off in one of India’s worst aviation disasters.“It is pertinent to note that the incident (Amritsar–Birmingham) is another pointer towards the Air India crash of B-787 aircraft. Thus, in the interest of air safety, FIP insists that DGCA must thoroughly check and investigate the electrical system of B-787 aircraft in the country,” the Federation said in its letter to the DGCA, according to PTI.“There have been numerous incidents on the B-787 aircraft. We have strongly taken up with the Civil Aviation Ministry and Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) to thoroughly check the electrical system of all B-787 planes in the country,” the letter stated.The pilots’ body also highlighted that ever since the AI-171 (Ahmedabad–London) crash on June 12, it has been constantly urging a comprehensive review of the Boeing 787 electrical systems. “Subsequent to the crash, DGCA checked only the fuel control switches of B-787 in Air India (fleet),” it added.The latest incident involved the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of Air India flight AI 117 — a Boeing 787 Dreamliner — deploying during the flight's final approach, at around 400 feet, just seconds before landing. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for further checks. Notably, RAT had also deployed seconds after the ill-fated AI 171 lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.“The operating crew of flight AI-117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine RAT during its final approach. All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing,” the airline said in a statement.The RAT is a last-resort emergency power system that deploys automatically in the event of a dual engine failure or total electronic or hydraulic failure, using wind speed to generate emergency power.Engine or hydraulic/electrical failure or software malfunction are being cited as among the several probable causes of the AI 171 crash that killed 260 people, of whom 241 were onboard the flight.","The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP), a pilots’ body, on Sunday called for a thorough inspection of the electrical systems of all Boeing 787 planes operating in India.

NAGPUR: At least 14 more children from Madhya Pradesh's Chhindwara district who had been administered the now-banned cough syrup Coldrif are battling for life in government and private hospitals in Nagpur after suffering renal failure.Lab reports confirmed the six children who died at GMCH-Nagpur had suffered renal failure due to diethylene glycol (DEG) toxicity. Syrup samples were found to be contaminated with 48.6% DEG, a toxic substance used as antifreeze and in brake fluids. Initially, these deaths were assumed to be cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), but zero urine output in patients with a history of cough and fever raised alarm among govt doctors.Nagpur municipal corporation is set to issue guidelines to all medical practitioners, advising them not to prescribe cough syrups, especially to children below five years.On Sunday, Maharashtra government banned Coldrif, manufactured by Sresan Pharma in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram. Head of GMCH's paediatrics department, Dr Manish Tiwari, said three children remain on ventilator support while two are in critical condition.Deputy director of health services Dr Shashikant Shambharkar said 14 children are currently admitted to govt and private hospitals in Nagpur. ""We have instructed all public health hospitals in Nagpur, spanning six districts, not to prescribe this syrup. However, none of our hospitals had any supply or stock of Coldrif. No renal failure cases among children from Nagpur or Vidarbha districts have been reported. We only have sporadic AES cases from some Vidarbha districts, but they are not related to cough syrup,"" he said.Paediatric intensivist Dr Anupam Bahe, who treated six children from MP for renal failure at Nelson Hospital, said besides Coldrif, their patients were also given two other cough syrups.

NEW DELHI: Amid the controversy over deaths of children in parts of Madhya Pradesh, allegedly due to consumption of sub-standard cough syrup, Union health secretary Punya Salila Srivastava on Sunday asked states/UTs to ensure strict compliance with Revised Schedule M – updated Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) — by all drug manufacturers.Srivastava, at a meeting with top health officials from all states/UTs, which was also attended by the chief of Indian Council for Medical Research and Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), directed rational use of cough syrups, particularly for children, as most coughs are self-limiting and do not require pharmacological treatment.Health ministry sources said the matter had been earlier reviewed by Union health minister J P Nadda, who had directed that the matter be discussed with states/UTs to ensure necessary action.Metropolitan Surveillance Unit (MSU), Nagpur, established under Pradhan Mantri-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), had reported a cluster of cases and related deaths from a block in Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh a few days ago.The samples of 19 medicines which had been consumed by the children were collected from treating private practitioners and nearby retail stores. Health ministry said chemical analysis so far indicates that nine out of 10 samples meet quality standards.However, one of them, viz cough syrup ‘Coldrif’, contained Diethylene Glycol — contaminant known to cause serious kidney injury if used in higher proportions — beyond the permissible limit.“Cancellation of manufacturing licence of the unit that supplied the specific batch of the drug has been recommended by CDSCO based on inspection findings. Criminal proceedings have also been initiated,” the ministry said.DCGI Dr Rajeev Raghuvanshi reiterated the need for drug manufacturing units to strictly comply with Revised Schedule M for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).He noted that certain firms which had applied for the government’s infrastructure upgrade have been given an extension till December.","Health ministry sources said the matter had been earlier reviewed by Union health minister J P Nadda.

In Rajouri, several homes, roads, and farmlands were affected, while landslides blocked key routes, making access difficult for residents.In Udhampur’s Bant village, a critical bridge was washed away by the rain, cutting off movement and affecting daily life.Meanwhile, Bhaderwah - a popular tourist destination - is facing a severe downturn in footfall due to a combination of natural calamities including flash floods, cloudbursts, and recent militant-related incidents.Local residents, many of whom depend on tourism for their livelihood, have urged the government to intervene. “Our economy depends on visitors. The government should organise festivals and take steps to revive tourism here,” a local resident said, appealing to their MLA to raise the matter in the assembly.The situation remains tense as rains continue across several parts of the Union territory, with disaster response teams on alert.","The Jammu and Kashmir administration ordered the closure of all government and private schools in the Jammu division for two days - October 6 and 7.

What the visa will enable and what lies ahead

Multi-country access under a single tourist permit



Removal of visa redundancies for each GCC country



Streamlined documentation and processing for visitors



Greater regional tourism alignment and joint branding









The GCC will begin testing a single unified tourist visa in the fourth quarter of 2025, allowing travel across all six member countries under one permit. UAE Minister of Economy and Chairman of the Emirates Tourism Council, Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, confirmed the pilot rollout during World Tourism Day 2025.In an interview with the UAE news agency WAM, Al Marri said the visa, also referred to as the GCC Grand Tourist Visa, will be fully implemented at a later stage following the pilot phase.While a specific official launch date has not yet been disclosed, the announcement marks a major milestone for regional travel integration and comes just months after the visa was officially approved earlier in June 2025.At its core, the unified GCC tourist visa, also referred to in some discussions as the ""GCC Grand Tours Visa"" — is modeled after Europe’s Schengen visa system, offering travelers the ability to move freely across multiple countries using a single permit.The visa will cover all six GCC member states: the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait.According to the minister, the visa is intended as aBy allowing tourists to travel between GCC countries without the need for multiple visas, the initiative seeks to position the Gulf as a more accessible and unified travel hub for international visitors.This policy shift comes at a time when the region is actively expanding its tourism offering and infrastructure. The unified visa will eliminate repetitive paperwork and multiple applications, and instead offer multi-entry access across all six countries, simplifying travel logistics significantly.The groundwork for the visa was laid months earlier. On June 16, 2025, speaking on the sidelines of the UAE Hospitality Summer Camp press conference, Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri confirmed in an interview with Khaleej Times that the unified visa had already received formal approval.he said.This comment pointed to ongoing coordination among internal ministries and agencies across the Gulf. As of now, the visa is under active review by the UAE’s Ministry of Interior and other relevant GCC authorities. While no exact date has been given for full implementation, officials across the region have consistently indicated that the launch is expected “soon.”The upcoming pilot phase in Q4 2025 will test the system’s operational readiness before full deployment across all six countries.The visa initiative comes at a time when travel between GCC countries is already on the rise, and there’s a strong push to build a shared regional tourism identity. Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri pointed out that in 2024, 3.3 million visitors from GCC countries came to the UAE, making up 11 percent of all hotel guests.Breakdown by country of origin:These figures underscore the significant volume of regional movement already taking place, reinforcing the potential impact of a unified visa system in making intra-Gulf travel even more efficient and accessible.Officials strongly believe that simplifying cross-border movement through a shared visa will deepen tourism cooperation, increase visitor stays, and actively encourage wider exploration of the Gulf’s varied travel destinations — from Saudi heritage sites to Emirati beaches, Omani mountains, and iconic Qatari cultural landmarks.While final logistics are being worked out, the goals of the unified GCC visa are clear:These practical outcomes are closely aligned with the GCC’s long-term vision for sustainable economic and infrastructural integration. The visa is not only a tourist facilitation tool but also a broader strategic policy lever aimed at reinforcing the Gulf’s position as a globally competitive and attractive tourism destination.","The GCC will begin testing a single unified tourist visa in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Already travelling? Don’t leave it to the last minute





A new immigration requirement for travellers heading to India officially came into effect on October 1, and if you're flying from the UAE, chances are you’ve already been alerted. Emirates, one of the region’s busiest carriers, had issued a formal notice to passengers on September 30, outlining the change. It’s not a last-minute rule—but it’s one worth revisiting before your next trip. The requirement? A new e-Arrival Card that must be completed before departure.Here’s everything you need to know.India’s Bureau of Immigration has launched a digital e-Arrival Card system, now mandatory for all non-Indian nationals entering the country. The system officially went live on October 1, 2025, replacing the previous paper-based arrival forms. This shift is aimed at streamlining immigration, cutting down processing times, and supporting India’s broader move toward digital-first services at airports.The system is currently operational at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI), one of the busiest gateways into India. The project is being overseen by GMR Aero-led Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) under the aegis of the Bureau of Immigration.By enabling travellers to pre-submit arrival details online, the process removes the need to fill out physical forms after landing—significantly reducing queue times and congestion at immigration counters.Emirates, which operates hundreds of weekly flights between the UAE and India, issued its advisory on September 30, just ahead of the implementation date. The airline notified passengers that starting October 1, all non‑Indian nationals travelling to India would be required to complete the e‑Arrival Card before boarding.Travellers are advised to fill out the form no earlier than 72 hours and no later than 24 hours prior to departure. Emirates has also reminded passengers that failing to submit the form in advance will result in longer processing at the airport upon arrival. There is no registration fee involved.Passengers are encouraged to verify and update their contact information via the ‘Manage Your Booking’ section to receive future travel alerts.The e-Arrival Card can be submitted via several official government channels. Travellers can access the digital form through the following platforms:The process is paperless and requires no document uploads. Once submitted, a confirmation email is sent. This can be shown digitally at immigration, although carrying a printed copy is recommended for added convenience.The form is simple, but it must be filled accurately. Travellers are required to submit the following details:Once submitted, the confirmation serves as your digital arrival card and replaces the need for any handwritten immigration forms upon entry into India.With thousands of UAE-based passengers flying to India each day—whether for family visits, work, or medical tourism—the rollout of the e-Arrival Card brings a significant procedural shift. The benefit is clear: faster immigration clearance and less time spent waiting in long queues.But that’s only if the form is filled in advance. Delhi Airport, where the system is currently active, is working to align with international standards by removing all manual paperwork at entry points—similar to processes already followed at airports in Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia.Travellers who arrive without completing the mandatory e-Arrival Card will still be processed but should expect longer delays and possible re-routing to manual counters.This new rule does not apply to Indian passport holders or Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders. These travellers already have access to the Fast Track Immigration–Trusted Traveller Programme (FTI-TTP), which was introduced at Delhi Airport in June 2024. That programme continues to function separately and is unaffected by the new digital arrival system for foreign nationals.The e-Arrival Card system is already in effect and mandatory. With Emirates and other carriers having issued notices ahead of time, travellers are expected to be aware of the rule. But if you’ve got a flight coming up and haven’t yet filled out the form, now’s the time.Head to one of the official platforms listed above, fill in the details, and secure your confirmation. It’s free, takes only a few minutes, and will save you far more time once you land.","India’s Bureau of Immigration has launched a digital e-Arrival Card system, now mandatory for all non-Indian nationals entering the country.

"Asian stocks: Japan's Nikkei hits record high after Takaichi's election win; yen weakens, markets mixed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-japans-nikkei-hits-record-high-after-takaichis-election-win-yen-weakens-markets-mixed/articleshow/124328872.cms,"



Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged more than 4% on Monday, hitting record highs after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative and close ally of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as its new leader, paving the way for her to become Japan’s first female prime minister.The Nikkei jumped 3.9% to close at 47,566.84, after briefly crossing the 46,000 mark for the first time ever. The broader Topix index also advanced 2.3%, buoyed by investor optimism that Takaichi will continue Abe’s pro-market and stimulus-heavy economic policies.In contrast, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged 0.1% lower to 27,119.36, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was largely unchanged at 8,984.70.Markets in mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea remained shut for holidays, AP reported.The yen weakened against the US dollar, falling to 149.79 per dollar from 149.33 a day earlier, amid expectations that Takaichi could introduce higher public spending measures, potentially adding to inflationary pressures. The euro dipped slightly to $1.1720.Takaichi, 64, is seen as a protégé of Shinzo Abe and has long admired former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Known for her hawkish views, she has vowed to strengthen Japan’s defence, boost industrial competitiveness, and implement measures to address demographic challenges such as the country’s ageing population and rising debt burden.""The Nikkei was on course to reach as high as 48,000 by year-end, but because Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, it shot up toward that level already,"" Hitoshi Asaoka, the chief strategist at Asset Management One told Reuters.""The market welcomes her spending policy, but whether she can achieve that goal is not certain, as the LDP is still a minority party. The Nikkei may retreat once before year-end.""An unconfirmed report suggesting that the US President Donald Trump may ease tariffs on auto parts and manufacturing materials also helped lift Japanese automakers’ shares. Toyota Motor Corp. jumped 4.9%, while Honda Motor Co. gained 4.7%.Meanwhile, Wall Street ended last week mostly higher, with the S&P 500 edging up 0.1% to 6,715.79, its seventh winning week in nine.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5% to 46,758.28, both setting new records, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3% to 22,780.51.Oil prices also strengthened in early Monday trade after OPEC+ announced a smaller-than-expected increase in output.Brent crude rose 1% to $65.16 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) climbed 1% to $61.46.The oil alliance, which includes Russia and other non-OPEC producers, agreed to add just 137,000 barrels per day in November, matching October’s modest increase, to avoid oversupply and maintain price stability.","Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged more than 4% on Monday, hitting record highs.

What to look for



Corporate profits

Interest rate cuts

AI optimism





Investors were bracing for turbulence on Wall Street as the US government shutdown delayed key economic reports. Yet, defying expectations, the stock market surged on Friday, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting record highs.The rally isn’t just driven by Big Tech. Though companies like Nvidia, riding the AI boom, are still performing strongly, gains are widespread across the US stock market, according to AP.Smaller companies are also thriving: the Russell 2000 index has hit a record after taking nearly four years to recover its previous peak. Gold has reached new highs, and the most popular US bond fund is on track for its strongest year in at least five.Historically, shutdowns have had little impact on markets or the broader economy, and investors expect a similar outcome this time. Many professional investors believe the market could continue to rise, even after a 35% increase since April.But if the shutdown is not hitting the market, what may impact it?Despite the optimism, some experts worry that stocks are getting expensive. Though stock prices follow the company’s profit, lately they have surged much faster than corporate profits, and the S&P 500 is now close to its priciest level since the 2000 dot-com bubble, according to the Shiller price-to-earnings ratio, which measures valuations over the past decade.Ann Miletti, head of equity investments at Allspring Global Investments, says she’s concerned about speculative stocks, especially smaller, unprofitable companies. “It’s these little bubbles that are concerning to me. When you see things like this, it’s generally not a good thing,” she said, though she remained relatively optimistic about 2026.It is worth noting that indicators of an overvalued market are notoriously unreliable in predicting downturns. Stocks can remain pricey for some time as long as investors are willing to pay the premium, AP reported.Looking ahead, the upcoming earnings season will be closely watched. PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines will release results on Thursday, followed by major banks like JPMorgan Chase.Analysts expect the S&P 500 to report an 8% growth in earnings per share compared with last year, with companies needing to show continued growth through 2025 and into 2026 despite inflation, tariffs, and economic uncertainty.Another factor behind the rally is the expectation of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for businesses and households, boost spending, and make investors willing to pay more for stocks and bonds.Traders expect at least three more rate cuts by mid-next year, with Fed officials signalling a possible easing as the job market slows. But Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the Fed may adjust plans if inflation, which remains above the 2% target, persists.“I feel like interest rates and expectations of what the Fed is going to do are driving everything right now,” said Miletti. “If the Fed doesn’t cut as much as people are expecting, any of these areas that look a little speculative, because they’re not based on fundamentals, those areas will have some real problems.”Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, calls AI “the question of the decade.” He believes AI-related stocks are fairly valued as long as the sector continues strong growth and sales, as cited by AP.The AI boom is also helping to ease concerns about long-term interest rates and inflation. But for the benefits to last, AI must improve productivity enough to counter the rising debt levels in the US and globally.“If we do achieve these benefits for companies and for people's lives, everything can go well for years,” said Ma. “I think everyone is tying their fortunes to that ship, whether they realize it or not.”",The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Friday.

More than 200 outstanding educators have been awarded the visa in the first round, underscoring Dubai’s deep recognition of teachers as the essential core architects of its social and intellectual future.said Sheikh Hamdan.He added,The first round of applications saw a total of 435 candidates apply for the Golden Visa. Of these, 223 were ultimately selected, representing approximately 51% of the total applicants. The overall selection process was rigorously structured, relying entirely on a merit-based assessment rather than any demographic filters. Nationality, gender, or years of experience were all deliberately excluded from consideration in order to maintain absolute fairness.Instead, evaluation focused on:Special weight was given to individuals who had received national or international awards, published research in recognised journals, or demonstrated exceptional institutional or community impact.The awarded group included:Applicants came from varied professional backgrounds, covering roles such as senior leadership, librarians, and social workers, in addition to teaching staff.The Golden Visa rollout is a key part of Dubai’s Education 33 (E33) Strategy, which aims to position the city as a global hub for educational talent. This strategy places educators at the centre of its mission to advance learning quality and attract global expertise.Aisha Miran, Director-General of the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), commented on the significance of this milestone.She further added,This move is in line with the broader goals of Dubai's education roadmap for the next decade: to bring in passionate, world-class teachers who promote lifelong learning and contribute to the emirate’s evolving knowledge economy.Following the success of the first round, Dubai has opened applications for the second round of Golden Visas. Eligible candidates include educators currently employed in private early childhood centres, schools, and international higher education institutions across the emirate.The application window runs from 15th October to 15th December 2025, giving educators a two-month period to apply for this prestigious recognition.The UAE Golden Visa is a long-term residency program launched in 2019, designed to attract and retain exceptional talent in vital sectors including investment, science, medicine, entrepreneurship, and now, education.Qualified individuals are granted a renewable 5- or 10-year residency, allowing them to live, work, study, and travel freely within the UAE, without the need for a local sponsor.In October 2024, the program expanded to include teachers, principals, early childhood center (ECC) managers, and academic faculty in Dubai. This inclusion reflects the UAE’s growing acknowledgment of the vital role educators play in shaping future generations and aligns with the Dubai Education Strategy 2030 (E33).The UAE Golden Visa offers a suite of personal, professional, and financial advantages that few other residency schemes in the world can match:A renewable long-term visa valid for up to a decade, providing unmatched career and life stability.Applicants can apply independently, without needing to be tied to a specific job or employer.Visa holders can freely work, teach, or engage in business within Dubai and across the UAE.The UAE offers zero income tax, no capital gains tax, and no inheritance tax, maximizing your earnings.Visa holders can sponsor spouses and children of any age for residency.Golden Visa holders can sponsor an unlimited number of domestic workers, including drivers, nannies, and household staff.Introduced in 2022, the Esaad card grants exclusive discounts at over 7,000 businesses in the UAE and across 92 countries.

Elon Musk maintains lead over rivals as Larry Ellison briefly challenges his fortune

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has made history as the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion, highlighting his unrivaled influence in the global technology and business arena. This unprecedented milestone is driven largely by the soaring value of Tesla, his electric vehicle company, whose shares have surged due to strong sales, innovation, and investor confidence. Beyond Tesla, Musk’s wealth is bolstered by his space exploration venture SpaceX, which continues to secure contracts and expand its satellite operations, and his artificial intelligence startup xAI, which is gaining traction in the AI sector. Musk’s diversified portfolio, visionary leadership, and relentless focus on technological breakthroughs have positioned him as the world’s richest individual, reshaping industries along the way.On Wednesday afternoon, Forbes reported that Musk’s net worth briefly reached $500.1 billion before settling slightly above $499 billion later in the day. This exceptional wealth cements Musk’s position as the world’s richest person, significantly ahead of his closest competitors in the technology sector.The billionaire’s wealth is closely tied to his 12%+ stake in Tesla, which has experienced a remarkable surge in stock value over the past year. Tesla shares were up more than 3.3% at the end of trading on Wednesday and have risen over 20% year-to-date, reflecting growing investor confidence in Musk’s leadership and strategic vision. While Tesla remains the cornerstone of Musk’s fortune, his other ventures have contributed substantially to his net worth. The space exploration company SpaceX has seen increased valuation due to ongoing satellite and launch contracts, while his AI-focused startup, xAI, has gained attention in the tech world for cutting-edge developments.Recent months have also seen Musk redirecting his focus toward business rather than politics, a move that investors have welcomed. This strategic pivot is seen as a key factor behind Tesla’s stock gains and the corresponding growth of his personal wealth.According to Forbes’ billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison holds the second spot globally with a fortune of roughly $350.7 billion. Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after Oracle shares jumped more than 40%, driven by positive forecasts for its cloud infrastructure, AI initiatives, and enterprise software growth, particularly in healthcare and financial services sectors.Despite occasional competition from rivals, Musk’s diversified portfolio, including Tesla, SpaceX, and other innovative ventures, and his leadership across multiple high-growth sectors have reinforced his long-term wealth trajectory, placing him comfortably ahead in the billionaire rankings and maintaining his influence in global business and technology markets with unparalleled reach and ambition.Musk’s influence at Tesla is now more pronounced than ever. In September 2025, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm highlighted that Musk is “front and centre” in guiding the company’s strategy.Tesla’s board has also approved a potential pay package exceeding $1 trillion for Musk, contingent upon achieving highly ambitious targets over the next decade. These goals include boosting Tesla’s valuation eightfold, selling one million AI robots, delivering 12 million additional Tesla cars, and reaching several other business milestones.Musk’s recent $1 billion purchase of Tesla shares has been interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the company’s future prospects.Tesla has faced multiple challenges in recent years, including intensified competition from global electric vehicle makers such as China’s BYD. However, Musk continues to diversify Tesla’s portfolio, transitioning the company into AI and robotics, and expanding into digital currencies and other emerging technologies.Musk is also known for his outspoken views on social and political issues, including immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. While he faced criticism earlier this year over his involvement with the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), he has consistently emphasized that his business pursuits are driven by societal and technological impact rather than personal profit.Musk’s relentless work ethic and focus on transformative projects have become hallmarks of his career. As Tesla investor Ross Gerber notes, “Elon only involves himself with things he believes are important for society or humanity,” a principle that underscores his broader mission beyond financial gain. By combining innovation across electric vehicles, space exploration, AI, and digital technologies, Musk has not only become the first half-trillionaire but has also reshaped the global technology landscape, inspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.","Elon Musk is the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion.

'You Can Say I Love Modi, But...': Owaisi Questions Why Saying ‘I Love Mohammad’ Sparks Row In India





BAREILLY: The Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation has issued recovery notices worth over Rs 1 crore to five associates of cleric Tauqeer Raza in Bareilly for allegedly stealing electricity by tapping wires directly into supply lines. The enforcement followed communal violence on Sept 26 after protests over ‘I love Muhammad' posters turned violent outside Islamia grounds.Those named in the recovery notices were Wasim Khan, Monish Khan, Barkan Raza Khan, Aman Raza Khan, and Ghulam Navi. Officials said electricity was being drawn without a meter — an offence under section 135 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The section treats such violations as non-bailable and provides for imprisonment up to five years or a fine of Rs 1 lakh, or double the assessed loss. Chief engineer (distribution), Bareilly Zone One, Gyan Prakash, confirmed that the notices were issued as part of regular enforcement. ""No one will be spared if found involved in electricity theft,"" he said.The notice, accessed by TOI, read: ""An FIR was registered against them for direct theft of electricity by inserting wires. Despite revenue assessment being completed, the accused have not yet deposited the assessed amounts.""Individual dues were listed as Rs 15 lakh for Wasim Khan, Rs 22 lakh for Monish Khan, Rs 37 lakh for Barkan Raza Khan, and Rs 26 lakh each for Aman Raza Khan and Ghulam Navi.Mohsin Khan, reacting to the notice, told TOI he had no connection with the cleric or the FIR. ""I left Ittehad-e-Millat Council in 2005 and parted ways with Tauqeer Raza. Before the protest, I advised the youth not to respond to his call. A BJP district president spread the rumour that I am his son-in-law due to personal grudges. The outstanding amount shown against me is baseless. I do not own or run any e-rickshaw charging facility. I have no link to the FIR filed in connection with electricity theft.""The crackdown comes in the aftermath of violence that broke out on Sept 26 near Islamia grounds during a protest after Friday prayers. The protest was sparked by the circulation of posters with ‘I love Muhammad' written on them, which triggered clashes between police and protesters. Stones were thrown, and at least 10 police personnel were injured. The administration imposed Section 144 and suspended internet services.Raza and seven others were arrested and sent to 14-day judicial custody for allegedly inciting the violence. In the days that followed, authorities identified illegal structures, unauthorised power use, and other violations linked to his network. Demolition drives and departmental actions were initiated, including the present set of recovery notices. Officials said further legal steps may be taken if dues remain unpaid.",The Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation issued over Rs 1 crore in recovery notices to five associates of cleric Tauqeer Raza in Bareilly for alleged electricity theft.

Microsoft frees up CEO Satya Nadella from some duties; read Nadella's email to employees company-wide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-frees-up-ceo-satya-nadella-from-some-duties-read-nadellas-email-to-employees-company-wide/articleshow/124272687.cms,"Google Photos AI Update: Hands-Free Photo Editing

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

How Pavel Durov became Dubai's richest





In a country where royal families and oil tycoons dominate the wealth landscape, the richest man in Dubai is a tech billionaire. Meet Telegram CEO Pavel Durov who is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list. Durov is followed by Hussain Sajwani – chairman of Dubai-based luxury real estate developer Damac Properties, with a net worth of $10.2 billion. Globally, Pavel Durov ranks at number 118 in the Forbes global list. His rise reflects not only the global reach of his messaging app but also Dubai’s growing status as a hub for technology and innovation.Born in St. Petersburg in 1984, Pavel Durov is often referred to as “Mark Zuckerberg of Russia”. Durov first made his name by co-founding VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network. But after clashes with authorities, he sold his stake and left the country in 2014. That same year, he shifted focus to Telegram, which has since exploded into a global platform with over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide.Durov left Russia after refusing to cooperate with the secret service and provide encrypted data of his first social network's users.Telegram was banned in Russia from 2018 to 2021.In 2018 Pavel, with his brother Nikolai, raised $1.7 billion from investors to create TON, a blockchain system; it was shut down after the SEC banned it.Pavel Durov became a French citizen in 2021 but lives in Dubai. As per information available on Forbes billionaires website, he has five children that he shares with two ex-girlfriends. In the past, Durov has claimed to have donated sperm that led to him fathering 100 children.Durov relocated to Dubai, where Telegram is now headquartered. He later acquired UAE citizenship in February 2021.Relocating to Dubai gave Durov not only a strategic base for expansion but also UAE citizenship, placing him in a unique spot among the country’s wealthiest. Though Telegram app remains free to use, Durov introduced Telegram Premium in 2022, offering paid features to power users. This, combined with the platform’s high valuation, cemented his billionaire status.","Pavel Durov is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list.

Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas

'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.Speaking on the ""BG2 Pod"" podcast published Friday, Huang described the policy changes as ""a great start"" that addresses illegal immigration and visa system abuse. However, he cautioned that the steep fee ""probably sets the bar a little too high"" and could make foreign students uncomfortable about pursuing opportunities in America.The Taiwan-born executive, who has frequently cited his own experience as an embodiment of the American dream, emphasised that talent inflow serves as a key performance indicator for the country's future success. ""Smart people's desire to come to America and smart students' desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs,"" Huang said on the podcast.Huang agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the substantial fee tilts the playing field toward large technology companies that can easily afford visa sponsorships, placing startups at a competitive disadvantage. He warned that the policy could prompt increased investment outside the US and affect global talent flows.The Nvidia chief also addressed concerns about Chinese researchers, separating America's competition with China as a nation from policies affecting Chinese individuals. ""We need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed,"" he said.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March. The White House clarified earlier this month that the $100,000 fee applies only to new applicants, not visa renewals.","Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas.

There are questions about where Zoho is developed and where the data is hosted and who hosts it. There is a lot of false information we want to correct.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says U.S. companies should be able to compete openly in China.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Paramount to buy Free Press: Who is Bari Weiss? Rebel journalist set to become editor-in chief of CBS News,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/paramount-to-buy-free-press-who-is-bari-weiss-rebel-journalist-set-to-become-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news/articleshow/124284561.cms,"Who is Weiss?







Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement.

Australian economist Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, came under MAGA fire as he has been speaking in support of the H-1B visa program that allows US companies to hire skilled workers from foreign countries. Appearing on MSNBC, Wolfers said studies have revealed that H-1B inflow actually increased the wages of American college grads and the native employment figures did not change because of H-1B hirings.""If H‑1Bs took jobs, you’d expect lower wages for U.S. grads. The best available studies show the opposite: 1990–2010 H‑1B inflows raised wages of American college grads by 4.2% and non‑college by ~2%, with native employment unchanged,"" he said.The economist said that it is one way of thinking that if somebody is coming to the US, they are taking someone's jobs. ""But facts don't bear that out,"" he said, adding that all economic activities in the US are like a cake and H-1B is a key ingredient. If the US does not have a specific ingredient to bake the economy cake, they can 'instacart' STEM workers through the H-1B program. Without the ingredient, US will have to quit baking, make inferior quality products or buy a cake instead of baking it.Wolfers said all these options are not good for the US economy.Wolfers said more H1B means more patents, more productivity, as H-1Bs are not just workers; they cross the ocean bringing their fresh new ideas with them.As his cake analogy went viral, many social media users attacked him and said there's no ingredient missing. ""If the missing ingredient is underpaid indentured servants who steal American jobs sure,"" one wrote.""H-1B is the opposite of high skilled STEM workers.

An Indian student recently received a visa rejection letter from the US that said they were not convinced that he had sufficient ties to India that would compel him to return to India after his time in the United States. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kaushik Raj revealed that he made it clear during the application process that he was born and brought up in India and that his entire family lives in India. Kaushik Raj told Post that he feels the rejection came after the US officials went through his social media profiles, which is now a mandatory process for a visa.Kaushik Raj said he was not active on social media and did not post anything on controversial issues, but he spent four years working as a journalist and posted links of his stories. The rejection letter, however, did not mention social media profiles as a reason for rejection.The 27-year-old applied for a visa as he won a $100,000 scholarship to pursue a graduate degree in journalism at Columbia University.The rejection letter said: ""You were not able to demonstrate that your intended activities in the United States would be consistent with the classification of the nonimmigrant visa for which you applied.""It said that an applicant has to demonstrate that they have a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning.""Applicants usually meet this requirement by demonstrating that they have strong ties overseas that indicate they will return to a foreign country after a temporary visit to the United States.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

MADRID: The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832, an 87.6-percent increase from the same period in 2024, the health ministry said Thursday.Nearly two-thirds of the deaths involved people over the age of 85, and almost 96 percent were over 65, it said in a statement.The figures were estimated using statistical models, the statement said, adding that they may still be revised.The ministry used data from Spain's Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), which tracks daily mortality nationwide and compares it to historical trends.It also incorporates external factors, such as weather data from the national meteorological agency AEMET, to assess likely causes of mortality spikes.Although MoMo cannot confirm a direct cause between deaths and high temperatures, it provides the most reliable estimate of fatalities in which heat was likely a decisive factor.Most heat-related excess deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.The health ministry reported 25 deaths from heatstroke during the same period.Most victims had risk factors such as chronic illnesses, were exposed to high temperatures at work or during leisure activities, or lived alone or in homes without air conditioning, it said.Scientists have warned persistently that human-driven climate change is resulting in more frequent and intense weather events worldwide.Spain this year sweltered through its hottest summer since records began in 1961, with an average temperature of 24.2C, according to AEMET.Of the 90 days of summer, 33 were marked by heatwaves, AEMET said.The country endured a 16-day heatwave in August which fuelled wildfires that killed four people and destroyed a record area of land.That heatwave was ""the most intense on record"", with an average temperature 4.6C higher than average, exceeding the last record set in July 2022.Nine of the 10 hottest summers in Spain since 1961 have occurred in the 21st century, according to AEMET.Britain, Japan and South Korea also endured the hottest summers this year since each country began keeping records, according to their weather agencies.","The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832.

'Russia Will Bomb Germany If...': Berlin ERUPTS Against Merz; German Role In Ukraine, Israel Slammed

Closer cooperation between German army and police needed



First combat drones to be purchased



Learning from Ukraine



Rapid innovation and arms procurement







""We're really behind when it comes to defending against drones,"" defense minister Boris Pistorius recently admitted. Uncertainty is high after Russian drones invaded the airspace of several Nato countries in recent weeks. Suspected Russian drones have even been supposedly spotted over Germany. On the German television channel ZDF, Pistorius assured viewers that everything was being done ""to make up for this shortcoming.""Why is Germany so poorly equipped to defend itself against drones? One of the reasons for is has to do with the equipment needed to defend against drones. Shooting down incoming drones with fighter jets, as Poland recently did, is possible but also expensive and dangerous over populated areas.More suitable for this tast is Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft tank, which can be deployed quickly and can also combat swarms of drones. The Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, has ordered 19 of these, which will not be delivered until 2027. However, military experts estimate that the demand is significantly higher.Its predecessor, the Gepard anti-aircraft tank, was decommissioned by the Bundeswehr years ago and later given to the Ukrainian armed forces.It has proved extremely effective in repelling Russian drone attacks.In addition to jammers, drones are also an effective means of defense against drones. The Bundeswehr has recently acquired German-made interceptor drones that capture enemy drones with nets.""We need to develop a multi-layered defense system that provides various options for shooting down or disabling drones — electronic countermeasures, kinetic devices, and then low-tech solutions such as net launchers,"" drone expert Ulrike Franke from the European Council on Foreign Relations told DW.Another challenge that Germany faces in defending against drones has to do with the distribution of responsibilities. At the moment, responsibility for countering drone threats is divided between the Bundeswehr and the police forces of Germany's 16 federal states.Defending against external attacks, such as those from fighter jets or large drones, falls within the remit of the military. The Bundeswehr is also authorised to take action if drones appear over military sites.In all other cases, drone defense is the responsibility of the police, who are responsible for internal security. If a drone is spying on a German airport or industrial facility, for example, the Bundeswehr cannot be called in.Although the police do have means of defending against drones, the challenge they face is getting them to the location where the drone has been spotted quickly enough. Security experts think that setting up a comprehensive ""drone defense shield"" over Germany is unrealistic.The separation of military and police duties has developed over time and is enshrined in the constitution. Given the current threats, the Bundeswehr will now be granted more powers to defend against drones. Interior minister Alexander Dobrindt plans to allow the military to assist the police, for example, by shooting down drones. The Air Security Act is to be amended accordingly. Dobrindt is also proposing the creation of a new drone defense center to coordinate the work of the federal and state governments.The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones. Recently, inspector general Carsten Breuer, the highest-ranking German soldier, announced that they would conduct their first live-fire exercises with armed drones at the end of the year.In March, Germany decided to procure so-called kamikaze drones for the troops. These are aircraft equipped with warheads that explode upon hitting their target. This is something quite new for Germany.It is no longer possible to wage war without drones, this became quickly apparent in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion in February 2022. Hundreds of thousands of drones are being deployed there. On the front lines, small kamikaze drones loaded with explosives are destroying expensive military equipment. The widespread use of reconnaissance drones means that no enemy movement goes unnoticed. This ""transparent battlefield"" has radically changed the nature of warfare.Drone expert Ulrike Franke recommends following Ukraine's example: ""It is absolutely clear that Nato countries need to look to Ukraine and learn from Ukraine when it comes to the ability to deploy, manufacture and modify drones quickly,"" she told DW.The Bundeswehr must now keep pace with these developments. Due to political concerns, it has long refrained from procuring attack drones. Critics feared that unmanned, remotely controlled aircraft could lower the threshold for the use of military force. There has also been much suspicion about the autonomous functions that many drones have.It was not until the war in Ukraine that this changed. In 2022, the German government decided to arm Bundeswehr drones for the first time. It ordered guided missiles for five Heron TP drones, aircraft-sized drones manufactured in Israel. Until then, the Bundeswehr had used only unarmed reconnaissance drones.It took until the beginning of this year for the decision to purchase kamikaze drones. According to the Ministry of Defense, this marked ""the beginning of a new era for the German Armed Forces."" The small disposable drones are known as ""loitering munitions."" This refers to the drone circling above the target before diving down and exploding.The categorisation of kamikaze drones as ""ammunition"" has very practical reasons: ammunition is fired and, therefore, consumed. A larger drone, on the other hand, is considered an unmanned aerial vehicle. With regard to flight safety and personnel certification, aircraft are subject to significantly higher technical requirements, thereby circumventing them.The German armed forces have already begun conducting training exercises on the deployment and defense against drones. This is now considered an ""everyman-skill"" that every soldier must master. A specific number of drones are being procured for this purpose and for immediate needs.What's more, the Bundeswehr is keen to avoid having to keep thousands of drones in storage. Technology in this field is advancing so rapidly that the usual approach to arms procurement, long lead times, long periods of use, would be counterproductive. So new contractual agreements are being made with manufacturers to ensure they can quickly deliver large quantities of the latest standard models when needed.German AI start-ups are the first choice now. Among them is Helsing, a Munich-based company founded in 2021, which has already produced several thousand combat drones for Ukraine.","Germany's armed forces have ordered 19 combat drones, which will not be delivered until 2027. The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones. In March, Germany decided to procure so-called kamikaze drones for the troops.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124291295,imgsize-1126348,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
