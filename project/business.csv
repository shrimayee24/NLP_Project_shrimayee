Mamata Banerjee, who went to the UK recently, with the permission and approval of the ministry of external affairs, has brought unimaginable shame to our country, especially to the People of West Bengal. We hang our heads in utter shame as because our ""so-called representative"" has deliberately and repeatedly undermined our country on the international stage,"" the letter read.""Firstly, while meeting the business community of the UK during a business event in London, she stirred a controversy by praising the 'British Heritage' of '190-year British rule over India and Bengal'. She fondly spoke about ""emotional relation with the UK and remembered the colonial times as a blissful passage of time,"" it added.Adhikari also accused Mamata of undermining India's achievements on foreign soil after she differed with the prediction that India would become the world's first economy by 2060.""This was just not it. She then did the unthinkable. Undermining India's achievements on foreign soil. During a Q&A session at the Kellogg College, Smt. Mamata Banerjee was asked about India's economic progress, leaving behind the UK as the fifth largest economy in the world. Her scepticism regarding India's economic progress is simply treasonous,"" Adhikari said.""It is not only my opinion but a collective demand that Smt. Mamata Banerjee should not travel in future, to any foreign country, in the capacity of the chief minister of West Bengal, aided and assisted by Indian embassies and missions located overseas,"" Adhikari said.""I hope you would consider my request and conduct a thorough probe to ascertain the anti India Pitch made by Smt. Mamata Banerjee in the UK and make sure that it is not repeated in the future,"" he added.Earlier on Thursday, huge uproar erupted in the packed auditorium of Kellogg College at Oxford University as Mamata delivered her maiden speech.During a conversation Mamata disagreed with a prediction that India would become the world's largest economy by 2060""I will differ from that. There are so many things about which I should not speak here... internal and external affairs matters... I cannot disclose. I have some other opinions,"" Mamata said.She went on to explain, ""Because every country is facing trouble after Covid-19, and with the turmoil going on in the world... if an economic war-like situation is underway in the world, how do we expect that we will gain? Let us hope for the gain, we can only hope. It is our dream to see my country our best.

It only seeks to challenge the injustice made by the ruler. It is impossible to say that the words used by the appellant disturb or are likely to disturb public tranquillity. It is ridiculous to say that the act of the appellant is intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.

Since the fixation of circle rates affects everyone financially, the data and methods used to determine them should be made public.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Friday that India is ""very closely"" tracking incidents of attacks on minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The minister said New Delhi is making its position ""well known"" but cannot change the ""fanatical and bigoted mindset"" of a neighbouring country.During the Question Hour, Jaishankar drew attention to 10 incidents of attacks on Hindus in Pakistan in February. Seven involved abduction and forced conversion, two were cases of abduction, and one incident saw ""police action"" against students celebrating Holi.""There were three incidents relating to the Sikh community in Pakistan. In one case, a Sikh family was attacked. In another case, a Sikh family was threatened because of the reopening of an old gurdwara. There was also an abduction and conversion issue with one girl from that community. There were two cases pertaining to the Ahmadiyya community. In one case, a mosque was sealed and in another case, 40 graves were desegregated and there was one case pertaining to the Christian community, where a Christian person who reportedly was mentally unstable was charged with blasphemy,"" Jaishankar informed the House.He added that India also monitors the welfare of minorities in Bangladesh. ""Like in Pakistan, we track the welfare and well-being of minorities in Bangladesh as well ... In 2024, we had 2,400 incidents relating to attacks on minorities and in 2025, 72 incidents ... I have taken it up with my counterpart there. The foreign secretary also took it up when he visited Bangladesh. This continues to be a matter of concern for our government,"" he said.Responding to a query on whether India plans to take ""tough action"" similar to Indira Gandhi’s stance against Pakistan, Jaishankar said, ""We as a government and a country cannot change the fanatical and bigoted mindset of a neighbour. Even Indira Gandhi could not do it.""On March 26, Human Rights Focus Pakistan (HRFP) released a report highlighting a sharp rise in attacks on religious minorities in the country during the first quarter of 2025. The report condemned the escalating abuses, stating that relief and justice remain elusive due to resource constraints and the influence of religious and political figures.HRFP President Naveed Walter said, ""Religious minorities in Pakistan are easier targets for attacks, murders, blasphemy charges, abductions, forced conversions, and forced marriages. The lack of attention to their suffering and neglect is even more painful.""The report cited several recent cases, including the false accusation of theft against Wasif Masih, a Christian youth from Chak Jhumra, Faisalabad, who was assaulted and publicly humiliated with black paint on his face.","S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha on Friday that India is ""very closely"" tracking incidents of attacks on minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Adhikari accused Banerjee of undermining India on the international stage and bringing shame to the country during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.In his letter, Adhikari claimed that Banerjee’s remarks in London displayed ""devotion and admiration for the colonial masters,"" which he described as ""unthinkable"" for a Bengali. He cited her speech at a business event in the UK, where she said, ""I love UK because we have an emotional relation, historical relation... From the heritage point of view, ours and from yours also. 190 years, you ruled in India. You ruled Bengal... So we forget that? Always India remembers you, and Bengal also remembers you.""Adhikari condemned her remarks, saying that Bengal had been at the forefront of the independence movement, resisting British rule. He said that praising the colonial past amounted to ""public renunciation of the sacrifices made by our freedom movement revolutionaries.""The letter also criticised Banerjee for her statements at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India’s economic growth.

He alleged that Banerjee had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil"" and accused her of opposing the country's economic rise.The BJP leader further urged the external affairs ministry to conduct a ""thorough probe"" into her remarks and ensure she is not granted permission for official foreign visits in the future. He referenced existing guidelines that require the ministry of external affairs to approve such visits and suggested that her remarks should be considered grounds for disqualification.Banerjee's visit to the UK was marred by controversy, as she faced protests from a group of demonstrators at Kellogg College. Protesters held placards questioning her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video of the incident, criticising Banerjee for her comments on India's economic future. ""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.Union minister Giriraj Singh also slammed Banerjee, saying, ""Hiding the truth and insulting India, both are done by Mamata Banerjee. Today, the whole world is seeing and respecting our growing economy, but unfortunately, when Mamata Banerjee and the 'tukde-tukde gang' go abroad, they insult India. This is unfortunate.""Banerjee, however, responded to hecklers during her speech, saying, ""Please don’t do politics here on this stage. That you can do with me in my state, not here.""

Freedom of speech can’t be crushed on flimsy grounds: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/freedom-of-speech-cant-be-crushed-on-flimsy-grounds-sc/articleshow/119676324.cms,"Court must zealously protect rights of citizens, including right to express: SC

NEW DELHI: Holding that right to freedom of speech and expression was an integral part of a healthy and civilised society, without which it was impossible to lead a dignified life, Supreme Court on Friday said the right of citizens to express themselves could not be trampled upon on “flimsy and fanciful grounds”. The court quashed criminal proceedings initiated by Gujarat Police against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi over his social media post with a poem, ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno’.Creating another layer of protection to prevent harassment by the government or police because of spoken or written words, or by signs or visible representations and also to ensure artistic freedom, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said FIR should not be lodged blindly in a mechanical way. A preliminary inquiry should be conducted by the police to ascertain whether a prima facie case was made out or not under various provisions of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including Sections 196 and 197(1).Setting standards for assessing the impact of spoken and written words, the bench said, “When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position.”New Delhi: Seventy-five years into our republic, we cannot be seen to be so shaky on our fundamentals that mere recital of a poem or, for that matter, any form of art or entertainment, such as stand-up comedy, can be alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities,” Supreme Court said on Friday while exhorting the judiciary to be at the forefront to “zealously protect” the fundamental rights of citizens, including the right to speak and express themselves which it said was not honoured by the police and the executive in many cases.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan frowned upon Gujarat high court for not quashing criminal proceedings against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi for his poem which the court said talked about “love, non-violence and fighting against injustice”. The bench rejected the HC’s justification that it did not interfere as the probe was at an initial stage.“Courts, particularly constitutional courts, must be at the forefront to zealously protect the fundamental rights of citizens. It is the bounden duty of courts to ensure that the Constitution and the ideals of the Constitution are not trampled upon. Endeavour of the courts should always be to protect and promote fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of speech and expression, which is one of the most cherished rights a citizen can have in a liberal constitutional democracy. Courts must not be seen to regulate or stifle freedom of speech and expression. As a matter of fact, courts must remain ever vigilant to thwart any attempt to undermine the Constitution and constitutional values, including freedom of speech and expression,” the bench said.“In a healthy democracy, the views, opinions or thoughts expressed by an individual or group of individuals must be countered by expressing another point of view. Even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected. Literature, including poetry, dramas, films, stage shows including stand-up comedy, satire and art, make the lives of human beings more meaningful. Courts are duty-bound to uphold and enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Sometimes, we, the judges, may not like spoken or written words. But still, it is our duty to uphold the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a). We judges are under an obligation to uphold the Constitution and respect its ideals. If the police or executive fail to honour and protect the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, it is the duty of the courts to step in and protect the fundamental rights. There is no other institution which can uphold the fundamental rights of citizens,” the bench said.It said there was no rule that when the investigation was at a nascent stage, the HC could not exercise its jurisdiction to quash an offence. “When the high court, in the given case, finds that no offence was made out on the face of it, to prevent abuse of the process of law, it can always interfere even though the investigation is at the nascent stage. There is no such blanket rule putting an embargo on the powers of the high court to quash FIR only on the ground that the investigation was at a nascent stage,” it added.","The court quashed criminal proceedings initiated by Gujarat Police against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi over his social media post with a poem, ‘Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno’ A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said FIR should not be lodged blindly in a mechanical way.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119676317,imgsize-29488,width-400,resizemode-4/119676317.jpg"
Iftar outreach vs Waqf politics: Who will gain in battleground Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-vs-mahagathbandhan-iftar-outreach-amid-waqf-politics-in-battleground-bihar/articleshow/119666167.cms,"“Aankh chheen kar chasma daine vale log, rakh lo apne pass yeh Saugat-e-Modi' kit”

NEW DELHI: Iftar diplomacy , an annual ritual in Bihar, has become an important platform for political outreach this year as the state gears up for assembly elections amid the row over Centre's proposed Waqf Amendment Bill . The politics over the Bill has already taken centrestage in the poll-bound state with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) launching its mega all-India protest earlier this week from Patna.Chief minister Nitish Kumar and Union minister Chirag Paswan, who are key allies of the BJP, face immense pressure from Muslim organisations to oppose the Bill. Their get-togethers this year were boycotted by some of these organisations as a mark of protest adding an interesting challenge to their iftar diplomacy.On the last Friday of Ramzan, a large number of Muslims in Patna wore black armbands during Jummah prayers to register their protest against the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, following an appeal by the AIMPLB.Nitish Kumar, who is yet to make a statement on the Bill, has been consistently attending iftar parties to showcase his commitment to the community. On Friday, he attended an iftar party organised at Haj Bhawan in Patna. Despite the enthusiasm at Haj Bhawan, where attendees raised slogans of ‘2025 again CM Nitish Kumar’, the chief minister refrained from interacting with the media and left the venue shortly after meeting the community leaders.Nitish, who faces a catch-22 situation over the issue, would hope that BJP's ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign, launched to reach out to the Muslims, counters some of this anger and creates a division within the community.The ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign, launched by the BJP Minority Morcha aims to distribute special kits to 32 lakh underprivileged Muslims across the country ahead of Eid so that they can celebrate the festival without any hardship.The kits distributed under the ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign will contain a variety of items. Along with food items, the kits will include clothes, vermicelli, dates, dry fruits, and sugar. Women's kits will contain fabric for suits, while men's kits will include kurta-pyjamas.On the other hand, Nitish Kumar's arch rival Lalu Prasad and other opposition parties in the state are going all out to make the most of this anger within the Muslims. An ailing Lalu joined the AIMPLB protest in Patna along with his son Tejashwi, who is leading the charge against the ruling NDA in Bihar. Addressing the protesters, Tejashwi assured them that his party and its leader, Lalu Yadav, firmly stand with them in their fight against the ""unconstitutional"" Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The RJD also took a dig at the BJP by putting up posters condemning the saffron party's ‘Saugat-e-Modi' kits to Muslims while trying to pass the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The posters criticised the BJP-led NDA government over the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and read:(Those who take away eyesight and offer glasses, keep this gift to yourselves).They featured a caricature of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with four hands, each holding labels such as Waqf Bill, NRC and Masjid, among other things.Images of other NDA leaders, including Union minister Chirag Paswan and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, with Waqf Board and NRC written on their hands, respectively, also found place in the posters.The text on the poster read, “Take back the Waqf (Amendment) Bill if you truly want to offer a gift of love. If you wish to distribute something on Eid, spread love—not division. But we know this isn't possible because your (NDA's) shop of hatred will shut down.”The RJD top brass has been actively participating and organising iftar parties to consolidate the party's support among the community in the election year. For now, while the NDA allies, have used the Iftar parties to send across a message of unity among the partners, the state Congress leadership added a twist to opposition tale by giving the RJD iftar party a miss.Elections in the state are still 6 to 7 months away and it will be interesting to see whose Eid outreach translates into votes.","The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) launched its mega all-India protest earlier this week from Patna.

The FIR can only be registered with the CJI’s permission,” Shah said at the Times Now Summit 2025, co-presented by Dream Sports and powered by Pernod Ricard India. He also said a panel of judges was looking into the matter and one should wait for its report.The home minister touched upon several other issues including the Waqf Bill, declaring that govt would bring the bill before Parliament in the ongoing session, notwithstanding the protests by Muslim clerics, Islamic outfits and opposition parties. “(Then) Congress govt had passed the Waqf Bill in 2013 without any debate to appease a votebank. It is against the spirit of the Constitution. We are only trying to bring it in line with the Constitution,” Shah said.“The current law says Waqf Board decisions cannot be challenged in court. How can this be allowed? Even decisions of the govt are challenged in court,” he said while accusing opposition parties of misleading the Muslim community “simply to consolidate a votebank”.Earlier, while speaking on the alleged recovery of cash at Justice Varma’s residence, Shah said CJI Sanjiv Khanna had, in line with the procedure outlined in a Supreme Court verdict, taken note of the matter and set up a committee of judges to hold an inquiry. “Delhi Police and fire brigade are providing whatever documents are sought by the committee. They are cooperating with the inquiry,” he added. “The committee of judges will take a call in the matter and place its decision in the public domain. We should wait for the committee’s report,” the minister said.Shah declined comment on the transfer of Justice Varma, saying it was the domain of the SC collegium. Touching upon the demand for caste census, Shah recalled that the idea of a caste census was rejected by all Congress govts prior to 2011. “A socio-economic caste census was conducted in 2011 but they did nothing with it as it returned 48 lakh castes. Now, we are using technology to explore all possibilities and ways to correctly capture caste and sub-castes. As and when we take a decision on the census procedures, we will make it public,” he said.On delimitation, Shah reiterated the assurance that “no one will have to suffer even 0.001% injustice”. “This is the BJP govt’s policy,” he assured even as he questioned the timing of DMK and other parties raising the delimitation bogey when the govt had not announced any move to take up delimitation or notified its procedure. “DMK is trying to bring up issues like language and delimitation, anticipating defeat in the Tamil Nadu polls next year due to the corruption and chaos its govt has brought about in the state,” he said. On leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi’s grievance that he was not being allowed to speak in Parliament, Shah said he has ample opportunity to speak as Congress gets nearly 40% of the time allotted for all parliamentary debates. “He wants to speak during other members’ time. This may be OK in party office but not in Parliament that runs as per rules. As LoP, he should show respect for rules of Parliament and speak during his party’s time in debates,” he said.On Manipur, Shah said ethnic conflicts had been happening in the past too, sometimes lasting 3-4 years. “There is peace in Manipur for the past 7 months... Talks are being held with both communities. One round was held by MHA and another is expected soon,” he said.Ahead of PM Modi’s visit to RSS headquarters in Nagpur, Shah praised the organisation for training crore of Indians in taking decisions and working while keeping patriotism and nationalism paramount.","Home minister Amit Shah said no FIR could have been registered in the matter without a go-ahead from the Chief Justice of India (CJI) “When no FIR can be registered, how can a seizure be carried out? The FIR can only be registered with the CJI’s permission,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119676435,imgsize-729030,width-400,resizemode-4/119676435.jpg"
"Mega Rs 62,700 crore deal for 'Prachand' attack choppers inked after CCS nod",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mega-rs-62700-crore-deal-for-prachand-attack-choppers-inked-after-ccs-nod/articleshow/119664746.cms,"Light combat helicopters

NEW DELHI: India on Friday inked the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract to acquire 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters (LCHs) for its armed forces from Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ), in the biggest-ever such deal that was signed soon after it got the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security.The CCS approved the procurement of 90 LCHs for the Army and 66 for IAF, which are armed with 20mm turret guns, 70mm rocket systems and air-to-air missiles for offensive operations and precision-strikes in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Siachen Glacier on the borders with China and Pakistan.The 156 LCHs, along with associated equipment and training for Rs 62,700 crore, excluding taxes, will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and 5 Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract in 2022. “Prachand is a powerful machine. This decision marks a major boost to India’s combat capabilities and self-reliance in defence ,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.The CCS, incidentally, also approved the new defence cooperation agreement with Sri Lanka, ahead of PM Modi’s visit to the island nation next week.TOI was the first to report that the deals for the 156 LCHs and 307 indigenous advanced towed artillery systems with gun-towing vehicles (Rs 6,900 crore) would be cleared by the CCS and inked before this fiscal ends on March 31.The deals for the direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters from France as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Docks, collectively worth almost Rs 1 lakh crore (Euro 10.6 billion), however, have been deferred to be the next fiscal now.As per the contracts inked in presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, the 156 LCHs will be built at HAL helicopter factories in Bengaluru and Tumkur in Karnataka. “The deliveries will begin in three years, with 30 LCHs to be manufactured per year,” an official told TOI.“LCH is India’s first indigenously designed and developed combat helicopter capable of operating at an altitude of over 5,000 meters (16,400-feet) with a considerable load of weapons and fuel,” he said.The highly-agile and manoeuvrable 5.8-tonne Prachand has 45% indigenous content by value at present. “The plan is to achieve an overall indigenous content of over 65% during the execution of this 156-LCH procurement,” he added.Separately, the MoD also signed a contract with US company Metrea Management for “wet leasing” of one KC-135 mid-air refuelling aircraft, which will come within six months, for providing training to IAF and Navy pilotsThe total number of contracts signed by the MoD during the 2024-25 fiscal has now reached 193, with the overall value crossing Rs 2 lakh crore. “This is the highest ever such figure, and nearly double the previous such number. Of them, the contracts to domestic industry are 177 (92%), with a value of almost Rs 1.7 lakh crore (81%),” another official said.Powered by two Shakti engines developed with the French Safran Group, the Prachand can take on enemy infantry troops, tanks, bunkers and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). The need for such helicopters for mountain warfare was first acutely felt during the 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan.The chopper also has “enhanced survivability” through light-weight armour panels against 7.62mm and 12.7mm rounds, self-sealing fuel tanks, damage-tolerant main rotor blades, bullet-proof windshields and a low frontal radar cross-section.","India on Friday inked the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract to acquire 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters (LCHs) for its armed forces from Hindustan Aeronautics.

He is also serving life imprisonment for sexually assaulting a minor in 2013 at his Jodhpur ashram.Following the Supreme Court’s initial bail order in January, security around the rape survivor’s family was significantly increased.Earlier, he was granted a seven-day parole in 2018, later extended by five days.He also received a 17-day parole in December 2024 before obtaining his interim bail in January 2025.Asaram was first arrested in 2013 after a minor girl from Shahjahanpur accused him of sexual assault at his Jodhpur ashram. Convicted in 2018, he was sentenced to life imprisonment under the POCSO Act.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai on Friday said that the party's central leadership will take an ""appropriate call"" on the shape and form of alliances for the 2026 assembly elections, aiming to unseat MK Stalin's ruling DMK.His remarks come amid speculation about a possible revival of the BJP-AIADMK alliance after AIADMK general secretary and former Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami met Union home minister Amit Shah earlier this week.Asked about the AIADMK returning to the NDA, Annamalai said, ""I am not authorised to talk about alliance or the formation of alliance at this point of time.""""As the president of Tamil Nadu BJP, the role that is given to me is to strengthen the party in the state.

I was sitting in the lobby of a hotel, waiting to attend a session, with an hour to spare. The hotel was abuzz with preparations for a reunion—a gathering of men in their fifties, likely former classmates. As the guests started to arrive, loud cheers and animated conversations filled the air; they seemed engulfed in waves of nostalgia.There is something both heartwarming and melancholic about reunions. Heartwarming because time had softened old rivalries, leaving only camaraderie. Melancholic because life had played its capricious hand—those once dismissed as failures now shone like stars, while the once-envied prodigies had faded into anonymity.When we were children, sitting side by side at wooden desks, the world felt fair and equal. Our uniforms were the same, we shared our lunches and endured punishments together. Laughter rolled freely, tears were wiped away. And we dreamed the same dreams.With the naïve confidence of youth, we believed that life would be just and effort always equalled success.But life is an unusual classroom. Unlike school , where lessons precede tests, life tests us first and teaches us later. It is a mischievous storyteller, delighting in unexpected plot twists.The girl who once thundered on debate stages now hesitates to voice her opinion at home. The quiet one, whom nobody noticed, is now a celebrated bureaucrat.And we ask ourselves:I was reminded of a verse by Na Muthukumar, one of modern Tamil literature’s finest poets, titled ‘Nobody told us that life does not follow the predictable equations of the classroom. That intelligence matters but timing matters more. That hard work is invaluable, but networking often determines success.

Varanasi: For the first time, all meat, fish and poultry shops within the municipal limits of Varanasi would remain shut during the Chaitra Navratri festival that begins Sunday. A meeting of Varanasi Municipal Corporation ’s executive committee chaired by mayor Ashok Kumar Tiwari took a decision to this effect on Thursday.Eid coincides with the Navratri festival this year and is likely to be celebrated on Monday, depending on the moon sighting. Tiwari told TOI: “They (Muslims) should consider that their Hindu brothers find Navratri most sacred. So, at least for nine days, let it be.”The mayor has asked for strict compliance of the executive decision. When Tiwari’s attention was drawn towards Eid falling during the same period, he told TOI, “Since the proposal of the closure of meat shops during Navratri was passed in the executive, it would be implemented strictly.”“They (Muslims) should consider that their Hindu brothers find Navratri the most sacred. So, at least for nine days, let it be. Is anyone stopping them for 360 days?” he added. Tiwari said Varanasi is a “religious and cultural capital” with nearly 2 lakh pilgrims visiting the temple town daily. “A tradition should be followed, and it should not be seen as something forced,” he added.At Thursday’s meeting, executive committee member Madan Mohan Dubey proposed the closure of shops selling meat, fish, and poultry during Navratri. The committee also banned the sale of cigarettes near religious places and schools and approved charging a licence fee to cigarette vendors.Earlier this month, teams of VMC officials, led by the city veterinary officer, Dr Ajay Pratap Singh, had launched a drive to execute a decision taken by the corporation for the closure of 26 shops selling non-vegetarian food in the vicinity of Kashi Vishwanath Temple.

During a discussion on the same proposal in the VMC in Jan, the corporators had mentioned that there are no meat and liquor shops within a radius of two to five km in temple towns like Ayodhya, Mathura and Haridwar.

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.","The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants.

Team gives priority to cap space ahead of contract extensions



Mitch Marner's contract situation hangs over



John Tavares and Steven Lorentz in wait-and-see mode



A make-or-break offseason for Toronto



As the NHL summer gets near, the Toronto Maple Leafs are adopting a guarded stance on their roster choices. Based on NHL insider Nick Kypreos , the franchise's first concern is Mitch Marner's future ahead of signing contract extensions on other players, such as John Tavares and Steven Lorentz. Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving is also known to be a Marner enthusiast.The Maple Leafs are said to be waiting on contract negotiations with their upcoming unrestricted free agents until they decide if Marner will remain or if they will have to spend cap room to replace him. “It sounds like pending unrestricted free agents John Tavares and Steven Lorentz will have to wait until the offseason for any contract offers from the Leafs if they are to stay. The Leafs’ top priority remains leaving enough cap space to either re-sign Mitch Marner or bring in one or two players as suitable replacements.” Kypreos said in the Toronto Star.Marner, 27, is set to reach the expiration of his six-year, $65.4 million contract soon, and he continues to perform well on the ice. He has 89 points in 71 games and is still an integral offensive player for the Maple Leafs. Yet if he reaches free agency on July 1, he likely will demand a hefty salary bump, maybe into the $13-14 million per-year area.Despite previous trade speculation, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving has remained a strong supporter of Marner. The marquee winger wouldn't waive his no-trade clause at the trade deadline, making him the boss of the situation. The Leafs now have to determine if they can keep him or if they will have to look elsewhere.Vet Center John Tavares is also in his seventh and last year of a $77 million, seven-year contract. He has been contributing with 33 goals and 67 points through 65 contests. The Maple Leafs are not hurrying, though, to sign him longer term, holding off to examine how the Marner situation will develop before they commit long-term.Although Tavares is still an asset, Kypreos said his Toronto future will hinge on whether or not the club can generate the cap space necessary.In the meantime, forward Steven Lorentz is going through a one-year, $775,000 deal and has tallied six goals and 16 points in 69 contests.

'You have a great prime minister': Trump praises 'very smart man' PM Modi amidst trade tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-have-a-great-prime-minister-trump-praises-very-smart-man-pm-modi-amidst-trade-tensions/articleshow/119671847.cms,"US President Donald Trump on India-US trade relations.

US President Donald Trump on Friday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a 'great friend' and a 'very smart man'. He made these statements at a White House press briefing where he reaffirmed his position on India's high tariffs.""Prime Minister Modi was here just recently, and we've always been very good friends. India is one of the highest-tariffing nations in the world. They're very smart,"" Trump said. ""He is a very smart man and a great friend of mine. We had very good talks. I think it's going to work out very well between India and our country. And I want to say you have a great prime minister.""US prepares to implement reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, from April 2. Trump has consistently critiqued India's trade policies, calling it 'tariff king' and describing its import duties as 'very unfair and strong'.Trump had said in an earlier statement, ""I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have with India is they're one of the highest-tariffing nations in the world. I believe they're probably going to lower those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.""Addressing the issue, MoS ministry of external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said that during PM Modi's visit to the US on February 12-13, both India and the US resolved to deepen the bilateral trade relationship to promote growth that ensures fairness, national security and job creation. ""PM Modi and US President Donald Trump set a new bilateral trade target – 'Mission 500' – aiming to more than double the total two-way goods and services trade to $500 billion by 2030... Both sides announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by the fall of 2025.""""The two governments are in the process of taking these negotiations forward and are actively working to build a framework for the BTA, which aims to expand trade across the goods and services sector, whilst working towards increasing market access, reducing tariff and non-tariff barries, and deepening supply-chain integration,"" he said further. Previously, Trump had criticised India's trade practices, stating 'they have the highest tariffs' and 'it is a hard place to do business"". Trump had said, ""We will soon impose reciprocal tariffs- they charge us, we charge them. Whatever a company or a country, such as India or China, charges, we want to be fair; hence, reciprocal.""He continued, ""We have never done that. We were getting ready to do it until Covid hit."" Specifically addressing India's automotive import duties, Trump noted, ""India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%.""During his address to a joint session of the US Congress, Trump confirmed the reciprocal tax implementation on April 2, expressing that the US had faced exploitation from nearly every nation globally and promised to prevent such practices.Additionally, he addressed tariffs imposed by the European Union, China, Brazil, and Mexico, indicating that the US would implement corresponding tariffs based on other nations' treatment of the US.In a declaration from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles entering the United States, describing it as 'very exciting' for domestic manufacturing.The new tariffs, commencing April 2, will affect approximately half of all vehicles sold in the United States, including American brands produced overseas. This comprehensive policy intends to encourage automotive manufacturers to establish additional production facilities within US territory.","US prepares to implement reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, from April 2.
