Kakori centenary: This ‘dharamshala’ was revolutionaries’ resthouse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kakori-centenary-this-dharamshala-was-revolutionaries-resthouse/articleshow/112436769.cms,"TOI photo

Nestled in the bustling Aminabad market of Lucknow, the striking yellow façade of the 111-year-old Chhedi Lal Dharamshala is hard to miss.While many know that the building just in front of the iconic Jhandewalan Park is over a century old, only a few are aware of its role in India’s freedom struggle .This unassuming Dharamshala once sheltered freedom fighters who plotted and executed the Kakori Train Action , an act that shook the very foundation of British rule in India .It is believed that Ram Prasad Bismil , a key figure of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), resided in room number 227 of Chhedi Lal Dharamshala where he planned Kakori Action. Bismil, considered as the mastermind behind the daring operation, was a revolutionary dedicated to India’s independence from British rule. The Kakori Train Action itself was a daring attempt by HRA to acquire funds for their revolutionary activities. The plan involved robbing a govt treasury on a moving train.Current managers of the Dharamshala, Ram Prasad Verma and Ramnath Gupta, said that although they did not have the recorded history of Bismil’s stay due to a fire that occurred decades ago in which past records records were reduced to ashes, their predecessors had told them that Ram Prasad Bismil stayed there. Verma said that he came to know that nine other revolutionaries stayed in other rooms, all of whom had changed their names in the register to keep their identities secret. The revolutionaries used to go to another place to plan train action to avoid suspicion.“Even today, we keep room number 227 neat, clean, and maintained in remembrance of Bismil,” said Rajnath Gupta.To establish the authenticity of the stay of revolutionaries at Chhedi Lal Dharamshala, historian Ravi Bhatt said, “When Bismil was arrested for train action, a bedsheet was recovered from his paraphernalia. It is said that he had used it to wrap the money they looted from the British iron safe during the action.”Ram Prasad Verma, however, rued that though the dharamshala had historic importance, it was facing encroachments despite it being located in a no-vending zone.","Chhedi Lal Dharamshala once sheltered freedom fighters who plotted and executed the Kakori Train Action.

Kakori centenary: Treasure trove of history buried under ignorance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kakori-centenary-treasure-trove-of-history-buried-under-ignorance/articleshow/112436720.cms,"Only 22km from the state capital lies the quiet Kakori railway station which is home to a small two-room museum. Though the museum has many exhibits related to Kakori Train Action of 1925, it attracts not more than 20-30 visitors in a year, according to railway staff.On Aug 9, 1925, a group of revolutionaries , led by Ram Prasad Bismil, boarded the 8 Down train to target a cast iron safe carrying money that had to be deposited to the British treasury.The exhibits of the museum include the iron safe, a British-made brass bell used to signal arrivals and departures of trains on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, 18 documents bearing details of the day’s events, and a bench that was a witness to the event.Despite its historical importance, the Kakori railway museum fails to draw significant attention. To attract more visitors, murals of Kakori martyrs were added and Northern Railway developed the parks at the station as part of ‘ Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav ’ celebrations. However, these efforts failed to draw visitors to the museum.“Only twice a year, in Aug, when the robbery took place, and in Dec, when the revolutionaries were executed, 8-10 people from various walks of life request us to open the museum,” a railway employee said on condition of anonymity. He said that despite govt’s efforts, there was a lack of interest among the people in this crucial chapter of India’s history . Many residents of Kakori are even unaware of the museum’s existence.“I pass by the station every day, but I did not know that there was a museum here. There are no clear signages to attract the people’s attention,” claimed Rajesh Singh, a local shopkeeper. Sunita Devi, another resident, said: “I’ve lived in Kakori my whole life, but I heard about the museum only recently. There is little awareness among people.”Anjali Sharma, a college student, said there was a need for public outreach and steps to popularize the museum. “We were never taught about this museum in school. More educational programmes and field trips could help spread the word,” she said.Kakori Shaheed Smarak , located 2km away from the museum, attracts 50-100 visitors daily, most of them college students.Residents claim that the memorial requires better maintenance. Only two persons, a PWD employee and a volunteer, are responsible for the upkeep of this memorial. The memorial sprawls on 8 bigha land and has over a hundred trees, a temple of revolutionaries, an open theater, waiting area, and a bookstore.Maintaining such a large area with just two people is a major challenge, according to Kakori residents.Rajkumar Mishra, a PWD employee, said: “Pujari Baba (the volunteer) and I clean the site. As the site is big, I also hired a private worker to pick up leaves and cut grass. I’ve requested for more staff, and the district administration has promised to provide five employees, including a gardener.”Prem Yadav, a local resident, pointed out the issue of maintenance. “There are problems like peeling plaster, broken benches, and overgrown grass. The caretakers work hard, but more manpower is required.”Vikas Singh, a resident, said only those who know about Kakori Train Action visit the spot. “The bookstore has about 250 books on the freedom struggle, but people aren’t interested in reading,” he said.Reshma Bano, a Class 8 student, said, “If connectivity and facilities are improved further, the place will attract more visitors.”","Kakori railway museum has many exhibits related to Kakori Train Action of 1925.

Govt halves income cap for interest subsidy in PMAY 2.0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-halves-income-cap-for-interest-subsidy-in-pmay-2-0/articleshow/112435269.cms,"NEW DELHI: Now urban households earning up to Rs 9 lakh annually will be eligible for interest subsidy scheme (ISS) on home loan for a property measuring not more than 120 sq metre under the newly approved PM Awas Yojna (Urban) scheme, which officials said is aimed at ensuring financial relief for “deserving” beneficiaries — poor, low income and middle income groups.Earlier, the income limit for interest subsidy benefit was Rs 18 lakh for properties up to 200 sq metre. Similarly, the maximum interest subsidy has been capped at Rs 1.8 lakh compared to earlier average of Rs 2.3 lakh.Govt has also brought in the provision of incentive for building affordable rental housing (ARH) for migrant workers , students and working women’s hostels in cities and towns. The entities building such facilities using new technologies would get assistance of around Rs 1.5 lakh for one bedroom (30 sq metre) from Centre and states.As per the norm, such dwelling units will comprise of single bedroom upto 30 sqm, double bedroom upto 60 sqm with living area, kitchen, toilet and bathroom and dormitory bed of up to 10 sqm carpet areas each. Officials said soon a web-based interface will be launched where the live details of such units and dormitories available can be viewed for booking. “The rent will be fixed by local authorities based on surveys of surrounding area. The rent can be revised every second year for not more than 8% and capped at 20% in five years,” a source said.Govt has introduced major changes in the interest subsidy scheme category to leave no room for violation of norms, sources said. As per the new norm, beneficiaries taking loan up to Rs 25 lakh for a house costing maximum Rs 35 lakh will be eligible for 4% interest subsidy on first Rs 8 lakh loan up to 12 years. The subsidy will be disbursed in 5-yearly instalments. Beneficiaries can access their accounts through website, OTP or smart cards.TOI on July 18 had first reported about govt’s move to reduce the income cap to avail the interest subsidy and spreading the disbursement of the subsidy over five years, instead of upfront for better monitoring.Besides ISS and ARH, the PMAY 2.0 has the third unified component of Beneficiary Led Construction (BLC) and Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP). Under these, households with income of less than Rs 3 lakh per annum falling in EWS Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category can get financial assistance of up to Rs 2.5 lakh for building a house on their own land or provided by govt or for buying a flat.Sources said the earlier component of in-situ slum redevelopment (ISSR) under the PMAY has been subsumed in AHP as such beneficiaries will get higher assistance of Rs 2.5 lakh compared to earlier norm of Rs 1 lakh.","Urban households earning up to Rs 9 lakh annually will be eligible for interest subsidy scheme.

India 'fully ready' to add to fleet 2nd submarine with nuclear-tipped missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-fully-ready-to-add-to-fleet-2nd-sub-with-n-tipped-missiles/articleshow/112433199.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is now all set to commission its second nuclear-powered submarine armed with nuclear missiles for strategic deterrence, while the project to build two nuclear-powered attack submarines with conventional weapons is also headed for final approval amid China’s fast-expanding naval footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat , constructed at the ship-building centre (SBC) at Vizag, is “fully ready” for formal commissioning after extensive trials that saw some technical issues being ironed out with upgrades over an extended period.“The SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) will be commissioned within a month or two. She will then join her sister INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018,” a source told TOI.Parallelly, on the conventional (non-nuclear) warfare front, the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two nuclear-powered submarines, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations, another source said.The initial case was for six such 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ submarines (called SSNs) under `Project-77’ at the SBC. But it was first whittled down to three and now stands at two vessels. It will take at least a decade to build the first two SSNs, which will be around 95% indigenous, while the next four will be approved at a later stage, the source said.As per long-standing approved plans, India requires at least 18 diesel-electric submarines, four SSBNs and six SSNs to tackle the twin-threat from China and Pakistan, which is also turning collusive in the maritime domain after the land borders.The country, however, currently has only one SSBN in INS Arihant, which is propelled by an 83 MW pressurized light-water reactor at its core, and 16 diesel-electric submarines. Moreover, the conventional underwater combat fleet consists of six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines, apart from six new French-origin Scorpenes.China, in contrast, already has 60 submarines, and is fast building more. Its fleet includes six Jin-class SSBNs, armed with JL-3 missiles that have a strike range of 10,000 km, and six SSNs.INS Arighat will to a certain extent strengthen India’s weakest leg of the nuclear triad, or the capability to fire nukes from land, air and sea. The land and air vectors, with the Agni ballistic missiles and fighters with nuclear gravity bombs, are relatively more robust.While INS Arighat will also be armed with 750-km range K-15 missiles like INS Arihant, she can carry a larger number of them. The real teeth will come when the third SSBN, the slightly larger 7,000-tonne INS Aridhaman with 3,500-km range K-4 missiles, is commissioned next year.The fourth SSBN, which will be able to carry more K-4 missiles, is also being constructed under the secretive Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project launched decades ago. There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with much more powerful 190 MW reactors.Bigger SSBNs with longer-range missiles will give India’s deterrence posture greater credibility because they are the most secure and survivable platforms for assured retaliatory strikes after a first-strike by an adversary.The SSNs, in turn, are critical because they can discreetly operate at high speeds for long distances while remaining submerged for extended periods to take out enemy targets unlike diesel-electric submarines that have to surface or “snorkel” every few days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.Till the indigenous SSNs roll out, India is slated to get an advanced Akula-class SSN on lease from Russia in 2026 under the $3 billion deal inked in Mar 2019, as reported by TOI earlier.","The 6,000-tonne INS Arighat is ‘fully ready’ for formal commissioning after extensive trials.

"UP cops’ sketch of ‘serial killer’ exact match of latest pic, down to his shirt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/up-cops-sketch-of-serial-killer-exact-match-of-latest-pic-down-to-his-shirt/articleshow/112433562.cms,"The real photograph of the man the UP police have now claimed to be a serial killer and the sketch cops have released

&quot;If an FIR has been filed against an unknown individual and a suspect is detained, their pictures cannot be released to the media. Only after the identification process, as prescribed by law, is completed can the images be made public. Even bringing a person to a press conference without concealing their face is a legal violation if the identification proceedings before the magistrate are incomplete. Allahabad HC advocate SFA Naqvi

MEERUT: The recent arrest of a suspected serial killer by Bareilly police has come under intense scrutiny after people noticed a striking similarity between a previously released sketch of the accused man and his latest photograph.The eerie likeness — down to matching shirt patterns, fabric creases, and facial shadows — has sparked widespread scepticism about the legitimacy of investigation in the case which spanned 14 months from June 2023 until July this year and involved the gruesome murders of nine middle-aged women within a 25km radius in the Shahi-Sheeshgarh area of Bareilly district.A tweet by a Twitter user that went out pointing to the coincidence had by Saturday evening notched up over 10 lakh views.Police defended their investigation. Bareilly SSP Anurag Arya, who led the operation, told TOI, “This was a comprehensive chase involving collaboration with villagers to identify the culprit. We received numerous leads, tracked over 180 suspects, and conducted many interrogations. We collected pictures of suspects while monitoring their movements and set them aside after ruling out their involvement, eventually zeroing in on three persons.”The police, however, going by their account, seem to have released the sketches of the suspects though they also had real photographs of the three men with them.Arya added as explanation: “The sketches of all three were shown to hundreds of villagers, and most of them pointed to the sketch of a man called Kuldeep…” He revealed that the photograph used to create the sketch of Kuldeep was indeed taken when the suspects were called in for questioning at the police station. “The purpose of releasing the sketches was to validate the feedback from our tracking and interrogation teams with input from the locals”.Fuelling the controversy is a growing theory that the Uttar Pradesh police might have arrested 35-year-old Kuldeep Gangwar well before they released the sketch.This theory has gained significant traction online, with social media users noting that the uncanny similarities between the sketch and Gangwar’s photo raise serious questions about the methods used to go ahead with probe in the case that has shaken Bareilly for over a year now.Many on social media asked whether the right man has been caught for the chilling murders.Arya contested the claim. “There is a clear-cut media policy of the UP Police issued in the form of SOPs in Oct 2023 that the accused’s face must not be revealed in front of the media before the completion of the identification process or even after the arrest. And this is why we could not have released the real pictures of the suspects.”The arrest has been contested by Kuldeep’s brother, Raj Kumar, who has staunchly defended his sibling. “He’s a simple soul, incapable of such heinous crimes. His mental faculties aren’t sound,” Raj said. “Yes, he would occasionally wander off into the fields, but committing murders? Impossible. We demand an impartial inquiry. An innocent man must not be wrongfully accused.”Meanwhile, in Kuldeep’s village, Bakarganj, residents have dismissed the police’s claims. “There has never been a single incident of violence or harassment by him in or around the village. We’ve known him for years. He was a man of unsound mind and often roamed around aimlessly, not returning home for months at a time. But the police know better what evidence they have found against Kuldeep,” former village head Mohd Rashid said.Villagers have also countered police claims that he was a drug addict. Lochan Singh, another villager, said, “He would readily accept a beedi from locals, but drinking or addiction is out of the question as he never had any money. He used to roam about and people would feed him out of compassion.""","Bareilly SSP Anurag Arya says sketches of three suspects were shown to hundreds of villagers, and most of them pointed to a man called Kuldeep.

TV Somanathan to replace Rajiv Gauba as cabinet secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tv-somanathan-to-replace-rajiv-gauba-as-cabinet-secretary/articleshow/112433401.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finance secretary TV Somanathan was on Saturday named the new cabinet secretary , replacing Rajiv Gauba , whose term as the longest-serving top civil servant will end on Aug 30.A chartered accountant, cost accountant and company secretary, with a doctoral thesis on derivatives, Somanathan is known to speak his mind before political bosses and encourages other colleagues to present their views candidly.The 1987 batch IAS officer is a key person behind ushering in transparency in the Union Budget , under finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s watch, and an active supporter of reforms, including those related to capital gains tax and other areas.Having taken over as expenditure secretary just before Covid-19 struck the nation, Somanathan used the higher spending during the pandemic to also bring “below the line items” on to the Centre’s books — and has stuck to the principle.He also brought the issue of “off-budget borrowings” in states such as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to the fore during the annual meeting of state chief secretaries and ensured that fund raising by mortgaging govt property and pledging future earnings was minimised.Although Somanathan ended up earning the displeasure of several colleagues, his push for ‘just in time’ release of funds has helped reducing govt money lying idle in bank accounts. It was also during his term in North Block that the Centre cleaned up the centrally-sponsored schemes, with the finance secretary advising states to ensure periodic reviews. One of his unfinished tasks will be the review of the new pension scheme, where consultations have been completed and some sort of a guarantee is likely. But that’s a task that he can complete as cabinet secretary. He is known to share a good personal rapport with PM Narendra Modi.In 1996, he joined the World Bank through the Young Professionals Program, as financial economist and went to become one of the youngest sector managers in the Budget Policy Group. He was part of M Karunanidhi’s CMO before moving to the World Bank for a second stint and then to Modi’s PMO in 2015.Somanathan’s appointment also signals govt’s intent to move ahead with changes after opting for “continuity” since June, when it returned to office for a third consecutive term and is expected to result in a top deck reshuffle.Next up, govt will decide if it intends to extend home secretary Ajay Bhalla’s term as home secretary one more time, especially when he will now be junior to Somanathan.In any case, the appointment initially as officer on special duty in the cabinet secretariat till he takes over on Aug 30, initially for two years. Civil servants are also watching how govt intends to use the services of Gauba, a trusted officer of the current dispensation.Somanthan’s elevation will force the govt to appoint a new expenditure secretary with Arvind Srivastava, additional secretary in the PMO seen as the top contender given his familiarity with the finance ministry, having headed the budget division.Besides, he is the point person on the PMO for several decisions related to the finance ministry, including the Budget.","Finance secretary TV Somanathan was on Saturday named the new cabinet secretary.

"No justice & roads no safer, says Mihika, who campaigned against underage driving after husband's death 4 years ago",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justice-roads-no-safer-says-mihika-who-campaigned-against-underage-driving-after-husbands-death-4-years-ago/articleshow/112432092.cms,"Waiting for closure

Justice delayed, justice denied

It's almost four years to the day that Mihika Gupta lost her husband, Alok, and her two sons a father. Out for a drive on a Sunday morning, Alok's Harley Davidson bore the full brunt of a collision by an EcoSport, driven by a minor, near Cyber City on Golf Course Road. Mihika and Alok's friends had, after that, started a campaign against underage driving but the sight of teenagers sitting at the wheel, speeding and doing stunts, isn't just a common sight, the menace has claimed more lives, like in Pune this May when a realtor's minor son ran a Porsche over a couple.Alok (49) was on his way to Greater Noida when the accident took place. Two allegedly drunk teens, aged 16 and 17, were in the Ecosport. The minor who was driving the car now studies abroad, as does the other minor who was with him in the vehicle.""On Aug 23, it will be four years of fighting the case, fighting for justice. But nothing has happened, nothing has moved at all. There has been no justice in any way,"" she told TOI. ""Those people are living their own lives. In fact, the children who were in the EcoSport and killed my husband, are now pursuing higher studies abroad. And here my kids and I are, going through emotional, mental and financial crises.""According to a high court ruling in June 2015, if anyone under the age of 18 is found riding a two- or four-wheeler, an FIR is to be registered against the parents or guardians of the minor under Section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act, followed by a fine or jail term up to six months.The juveniles are now 21 and 17. ""Who's gone is gone. It's the people who are left behind who suffer. It's the families, the parents seeing their young child go so early, and it's the children, the wife,"" laments Mihika.""Every day is a struggle. We've not had a holiday in the last four years, the way we used to.""It was, she reminds, an open-and-shut case. ""There are witnesses to the case, the car number is known, the owner of the car is known - there is no flaw. My husband was wearing a helmet, he was in his riding gear, he had a valid driver's licence, he was driving on the right side and was not speeding,"" she said, relating the details of that harrowing day. ""Everything is clear but still there is no justice - what else is the court asking and looking for? What needs to be proved? I just don't understand. In these four years, not even once have the witnesses received any summons. There is no progress in the case - the date comes, there's a five-minute hearing, they don't turn up, then the next date of hearing is announced.""And too few people in authority are bothered about clamping down on the menace that is under-age driving. ""Nobody is even thinking about it, forget about being alert to it,"" argues Mihika. As far as she is concerned, the penalty must be according to the gravity of the crime, and it should be borne wholly by the minor. ""There should be zero challans, only punishment for minors driving on the road - whether it is driving while drunk, whether it is jumping red lights, or whether it's failing to wear a seatbelt.""Till the time they are not put behind bars, neither will the parents fall in line, nor will the children become aware. Heavy challans will not make any difference, punishment will,"" she stresses.""These incidents are happening because there is no punishment that is immediate and severe. Everyone thinks they can get away with it.""Ultimately, parents must take the blame, Mihika insists. ""If they are under 18, they are children, and till the time they are not adults, you are their guardians,"" she maintains. ""If the children are in your house, it is your responsibility to ensure that nothing goes wrong. If children can behave like this, then what values have their parents given them?""A week after Alok's death, his relatives held a series of protests and rallies urging strict measures against juvenile drivers and their parents, and in February 2021, Mihika began a 10km, 10-day campaign to grow awareness around underage driving and also to demand tough action against parents for allowing their children to get behind the wheel. This was at a time when Covid-19 continued to restrict the routines of daily life, but the pandemic did little to sidetrack Mihika from seeking justice for her husband.But even campaigning long and hard for justice in the months following the tragedy, proved an exercise in futility. Now, Mihika wants govt to intervene, to close as many such cases that are pending, as possible. ""Those campaigns just helped me file the case, because we weren't even able to file a challan,"" she recalls. ""The right sections were not being applied. That's how these protests helped me.""And she still hasn't received a single rupee in compensation. But she will not give up. ""I'm still fighting, and I will keep fighting.""It's no longer difficult. I've become so thick-skinned. I'm just waiting for justice, for my children and I,"" she adds. ""And it has to change the way people think. So, it all starts from home.""","Mihika Gupta lost her husband, Alok, and her two sons a father four years ago.

BENGALURU: Various stakeholders of private schools , including managements, teachers, and non-teaching staff, will observe Aug 15 as a black day , protesting against the lack of freedom and ease in running schools.Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, D Shashi Kumar, convener of Karnataka Private School Managements Teaching and Non-Teaching Staff Coordination Committee, said there is no freedom to run a “quality educational institution”.“The education department doesn’t honour any of the court orders. They don’t understand the challenges faced by private schools. Private schools aren’t involved in any of the policy decisions taken by the govt,” he alleged.Shashi Kumar’s accusations come at a time when the department has appealed against a high court order on the matter of renewal of recognition, which was in favour of private schools.“After 20 months of the court order, the education department has appealed against the order. It is impossible for old schools to have the same certificates as the new ones,” he said.“We require around 50 certificates from various departments, including that of fire safety and building safety. All these departments are engulfed in corruption. That the education department wants these rules back is only to encourage corruption,” he added.Meanwhile, teachers of govt primary schools have also threatened to go on a strike on Aug 12. The strike will be held from 9am to 5pm at Freedom Park and is expected to host thousands of teachers.“The new recruitment and promotion rules should be applicable only to teachers appointed after 2017, they shouldn’t be retrospective for those who applied before 2016,” said Chandrashekhar Nugli, president of Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association.In case the govt doesn’t pay heed to the demands, the association plans to observe Sept 5 as a black day and also refrain from teaching classes 6-8.","Chhattisgarh High Court condemned corporal punishment in schools, calling it inhumane and a violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Panathur Road: BBMP's Oversight Turns 3.5km into 1.2-Hour Epic Trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmps-oversight-turns-35km-into-12-hour-epic-trip/articleshow/112358096.cms,"The winding S-Cross and narrow railway under bridge is a notorious bottleneck on Panathur Rd

BENGALURU: In a quirky twist to the usual race for speed, Bengaluru’s tech hub is now hosting an unintentional contest: “Who takes the longest time to cover the shortest distance?”The spotlight falls on the ever-clogged Panathur Road , where travel time on the nearly 3.5km has hit an astonishing low. Commuters are now spending an average of 1.2 hours navigating this stretch, which connects with Outer Ring Road (ORR) that is dotted with multi-national companies.Panathur Road, especially the winding S-Cross and the narrow railway under bridge, is a notorious bottleneck that turns a short trip into an epic journey, highlighting the city’s never-ending struggle with its road conditions.Namma Balagere, a group of resident welfare associations, recently took to social media platform X to voice their concern, posting an image in which a car took 86 minutes to cover 3.5km. Calling it a ‘new record’, Namma Balagere (@BalagereConnect) dared BBMP to show if there was any other record beating this. “Imagine the condition of commuters,” the X post asked while underlining the fact that the stretch was just 2km from ORR.This sparked a wave of responses, with users sharing their own speedometer readings and journey times. Sandeep Reddy, an ‘X’ user, posted a picture of his speedometer showing a distance of 2.5km taking over 1.54 hours to cover, captioning it, “Can’t beat mine.” Asish Thomas, another user, shared that a 17.6-km stretch took 3.39 hours to traverse. The flood of complaints highlighted the dire state of the road, with users like Cumar K urging residents to take direct action by sitting in front of their MLA’s office, reminiscent of Gandhi’s protests.Manjunath Reddy, a resident, lamented, “The distance between Kadubeesanahalli and Balagere Road is just 6km, but due to poor road conditions, it takes more than two hours to commute.” He added that BBMP officials have promised improvements, though residents remain skeptical.Ramya K, another resident, described the daily challenges, noting that even a short trip to the grocery store can take 45 minutes due to slow-moving traffic and numerous potholes. Sunil P from Balagere, said: “The stretch is already congested, and with heavy vehicle movement, traffic worsens. People can walk to work faster than travelling by car or bike.”A volunteer from Namma Balagere highlighted the lack of alternative routes and the narrowness of the road, calling for the construction of a comprehensive development plan (CDP) road over the rail over bridge (ROB).Residents feel their complaints are falling on deaf ears. “We have written letters, conducted email campaigns, and even met deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar regarding the issue, but nobody seems to care,” a volunteer said. The BJP MLA, except for showing up when public pressure intensifies and assuring road development, has been of little help, he added.BBMP’s engineer-in-chief BS Prahalad said: “We are working with the railway department on finding a solution. In less than six months, we will widen the road and resolve the issue.”","Panathur Road, especially the winding S-Cross and the narrow railway under bridge, is a notorious bottleneck that turns a short trip into an epic journey.

But look at the persons from district judiciary who after being appointed as HC judges have a tenure of less than four to five years. They get a pension of Rs 15-25,000. Their tenure in the district judiciary is not counted. We have a slew of petitions by such retired HC judges.”“To get a pension of Rs 15-25,000 after spending the entire life in the judiciary is no social security for them. Look at the profile of such retired HC judges. They, except a few who can be counted on fingertips, do not return to practice nor do arbitration work after retirement. My earnest appeal to both of you (AG and SG) to sit down with the concerned officials (of the ministry) and examine the issue to arrive at a reasonable solution,” the CJI said.Though the AG reiterated that the issue involves multiple aspects, the SG said he and the AG would surely examine the issues involved regarding the pension. The CJI said, “We do understand the financial implications. But as the Supreme Court, we must also discharge our duties as the guardian of the judiciary,” he said and posted the matter for hearing on Aug 27.","The Supreme Court expressed grave concern over the pittance of pension received by retired HC judges, who were appointed as HC judges after spending their entire life in the district judiciary.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery : a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea.Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs.The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s age and preservation make it a valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the distant past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus.","Discovery was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

Susan Wojcicki , a pioneering force in the tech industry who played pivotal roles in the founding of Google and the meteoric rise of YouTube , passed away on Friday at the age of 56. Her husband, Dennis Troper , announced her death in a social media post late Friday, August 9. “My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after 2 years of living with non small cell lung cancer,” he wrote.“Susan was not just my best friend and partner in life, but a brilliant mind, a loving mother, and a dear friend to many,” Troper said. She was one of the most respected female executives in the male-dominated tech industry.Wojcicki's journey with Google began in its earliest days when she rented out her garage to company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Page and Brin — both 25 at the time — continued to refine their search engine in Wojcicki’s garage for five months before moving Google into a more formal office and later persuaded their former landlord to come work for their company.Wojcicki was named the CEO of YouTube in 2014.Wojcicki played a key role in Google’s creation and served nine years as YouTube's CEO.

After talking to private school operators across the state in the last 10 years, it has come to light that they are troubled by about 55 problems. There have been continuous demands from the government to resolve these problems but the government did not pay any attention”, said Kulbhushan.Kulbhushan Sharma said that private schools have been providing education to the students of the underprivileged class under rule 134A approved by the government for the last ten years and the schools have not been awarded fees worth crores of rupees. In 2022-23, the Haryana government started the Chirag Yojana, the payment amount of which was fixed at Rs 700 for primary, Rs 900 for middle and Rs 1100 for Class IX to XII. He said when the Delhi government is giving Rs 2700 per student per month for the education of poor children, then the Haryana government should follow the orders of the court and fix the amount per student and release the payment pending for 10 years to the schools immediately.Kulbhushan Sharma said that the passenger tax imposed by the previous Congress government on children coming to school by bus was completely abolished, but the BJP government imposed a passenger tax of Rs 20 per month per student, which is completely unfair.Kulbhushan Sharma said that districts of Haryana like Jind and others do not have any kind of NCR facility, but they have been declared NCR, due to which the life of buses running there has been increased to 10 years, in such a situation, a serious problem has arisen especially for the low-fee schools running in the villages of these districts. In such districts, the life of school buses has been increased by 2 years to provide relief to private schools.","Private school operators, teachers and staff held a large protest rally ‘Shikshak Mahaakrosh Rally’ under the banner of National Independent Schools Alliance ( NISA ) supported by different school associations at grain market in Ambala City on Saturday.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Ready to join politics, I’m already at forefront: Hasina’s son",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/ready-to-join-politics-im-already-at-forefront-hasinas-son/articleshow/112389252.cms,"As attacks on Awami League leaders continued in Bangladesh , Sajeeb Wazed Joy , son of former PM Sheikh Hasina, said he is ready to enter politics . Joy had earlier said he had no intention of joining politics.Talking to TOI over phone from his residence in Washington , DC on Thursday, Joy said, “I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers.If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. But the developments in Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum. I had to get active for the sake of the party and I am at the forefront now.”His statements came after Khaleda Zia was released from house arrest and her son Tarique Rahman, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s acting chairman, is returning to Dhaka.Speaking on the day that an interim govt led by Nobel Prize winner Md Yunus took charge of Bangladesh, Joy said, “I am sure the Awami League will take part in the election and we might even win. We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh.” Claiming his mother has no plan of seeking asylum in any country, he said, “For the time being, she is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim govt decides to hold an election in the country. I am thankful to PM Narendra Modi for saving my mother’s life at such short notice.”On Thursday, Joy’s sister Saima Wazed also made it clear she will continue in her role as the WHO regional director. “Heartbroken with the loss of life in my country Bangladesh that I love. So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD WHO,” she wrote on X. In a later post, she wrote, “To everyone who has shown concern: as much as I would love to see Ma, I don’t want to compromise her whereabouts in any way.”Joy stressed there was a need for “introspection”. “There definitely were mistakes. When you run a country, a lot of decisions are made every day. Awami League believes in introspection and we were ready for that. But we did not get a chance to do that this time. We never realized the situation would escalate so fast even after accepting their demands,” Joy said.He also said an alliance of BNP and Jammat will not be able to save the minorities. “If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure. If there is an alliance of BNP and Jamaat, that may not be good for India as Jamaat will not refrain from militancy,” Joy said, requesting India to mount pressure on Bangladesh to hold elections soon.","Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of former PM Sheikh Hasina, said he is ready to enter politics.

The high levels of international recruitment reflect weaknesses in the labour market, including persistent skills shortages in the UK,” she wrote.She asked MAC to find out what is driving the labour shortage and “how have the sectors sought to respond to these shortages, beyond seeking to recruit from overseas from overseas?”“What policy levers within the immigration system could be used to incentivise sectors to focus on recruiting from the domestic workforce,” she said, telling him the system is “not operating in the national interest”.The MAC report is expected in nine months. Ganapati Bhat, an IT consultant from Bengaluru who has worked in the UK since 2007 after arriving on the highly skilled migrant programme, told TOI: “There is no need to change the policy around this just because there is noise around immigration. We can hardly fulfil the vacancies in Britain as salaries for some of these jobs are not that great compared to India and the US when you take into account the cost of living.”","Thousands of Indian IT and engineering professionals travel to work in these sectors in Britain every year.
