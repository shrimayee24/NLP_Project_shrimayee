'Bharat ki baat sunata hoon': Congress vs Congress? Manish Tewari's cryptic post after being dropped from Operation Sindoor debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bharat-ki-baat-sunata-hoon-congress-vs-congress-manish-tewaris-cryptic-post-after-being-dropped-from-operation-sindoor-debate/articleshow/122965624.cms,"Manish Tewari (left), and Gaurav Gogoi

NEW DELHI: Amid reports that Congress MPs who were part of the multi-party delegation for the government's global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism may not be allowed to speak in the Lok Sabha debate on the Pahalgam attack and subsequent Operation Sindoor , Congress MP Manish Tewari on Tuesday posted a cryptic message on social media, invoking lyrics from a patriotic Hindi film song.While sharing a news article on why Congress did not allow party MPs Shashi Tharoor and Tewari to speak in Lok Sabha, the Congress MP posted famous lyrics of the Hindi film. ""Hai preet jahaan ki reet sada, Main geet wahaan ke gaata hoon, Bharat ka rehne waala hoon, Bharat ki baat sunata hoon,"" Tewari said in a post on X, adding, ""Jai Hind.""The Congress party reportedly approached Shashi Tharoor over the weekend to speak in the ongoing parliamentary debate, but he declined the offer and had not expressed interest on his own until then. His absence allowed the BJP to target the Congress, with BJP MP Baijayant Panda suggesting that Congress leadership was not letting Tharoor speak. However, Panda added that he was glad no one could stop Tharoor from speaking in the national interest.Shashi Tharoor avoided media questions on Operation Sindoor on Monday, responding with just one word -- ""Maunvrat, Maunvrat"" -- as he entered Parliament.According to TOI sources, Tharoor has now shown interest in speaking on the Indian Ports Bill, particularly due to its relevance to the Vizhinjam port in his Thiruvananthapuram constituency.The port was recently inaugurated in a high-profile event attended by the Prime Minister Modi and leaders from multiple parties.Congress MP Manish Tewari is expected to speak on the upcoming sports-related bills in the Lok Sabha. Though he initially showed interest in the Pahalgam-Sindoor issue, he later opted for the sports legislation. Sources said that under the party’s internal system based on performance and participation, MPs are generally allotted one key topic each to ensure more members get an opportunity to speak.India carried out Operation Sindoor on early on May 7 in response to April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and carried out precision strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK. India repelled subsequent Pakistani aggression and pounded its airbases.","Congress MP Manish Tewari posted a cryptic message on social media, invoking lyrics from a patriotic Hindi film song.

Women lead India’s 1st outcome-based skilling drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/women-lead-indias-1st-outcome-based-skilling-drive/articleshow/122966043.cms,"New Delhi :

Puja Kumari from a village near Bokaro, Ishrat from a conservative Delhi household, Simran Pandey from the capital’s workingclass lanes, and Sakshi from Jharkhand’s tribal heartland are part of a quiet but distinct shift in India’s skilling landscape. This change is being driven by the Skill Impact Bond (SIB) — the country’s first outcome-based skilling initiative.Launched in 2021 by the ministry of skill development & entrepreneurship through the National Skill Development Corporation, SIB is backed by a consortium of philanthropic and private partners, including the British Asian Trust and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) — two key organisations that helped conceptualise and fund the initiative. Along with JSW Foundation, HSBC India and Dubai Cares, they are driving one of India’s most ambitious public-private partnerships focused on women-led growth.SIB aims to train 50,000 youth, with at least 30,150 retained in jobs for a minimum of three months. So far, over 23,700 youth—72% of them women—have been trained across 30 job roles in 13 sectors, working with more than 700 employers. Of these, 75% have secured jobs, and 60% have stayed employed for over three months — well above national averages.As India approaches its demographic peak and eyes a $30-trillion economy by 2047, models like SIB offer a roadmap — targeted training, outcome-focused frameworks and sustained post-placement support.“We are not just experimenting with outcome-based financing—we are institutionalising it to build a resilient, inclusive skilling ecosystem,” said Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge) for skill development and entrepreneurship. He cited the Skill Impact Bond and Project AMBER as examples of how public, philanthropic and private investment can together deliver measurable social impact at scale. Outcomebased financing, he added, is becoming a powerful tool to ensure public investment leads to tangible results—particularly in skilling, employment, and women’s empowerment.Puja, 26, trained as a CNC operator through Pan IIT Gurukul and moved to Chennai to work with IM Gears, becoming the sole breadwinner for her family. Ishrat, 18, began working in Noida in a data-entry role while pursuing a BA through Delhi University’s School of Open Learning—without telling her father. Simran, 21, joined an IT training programme and now works as a customer care executive in Delhi, saving to become an air hostess. Sakshi, 23, a school dropout from the Malto tribal community, enrolled in Pan IIT’s apparel programme in Bengaluru and now earns Rs 15,000 a month, supporting her siblings’ education.Their journeys reflect a fragile but significant transformation. Many are first-generation formal workers navigating rigid social norms, migration, and financial strain to pursue aspirational livelihoods.Jharkhand leads enrolment figures with 26% of trainees, followed by UP and Delhi. But the broader skilling landscape remains challenging still: only 4% of India’s workforce is formally skilled, and nearly 30% of trained individuals are without paid work. Retention is especially challenging for women who have availed traditional schemes. While 84% of those enrolled under such schemes complete certification, fewer than 10% stay in jobs beyond three months.The SIB seeks to reverse this trend by tying funding not to enrolment or certification, but to job placement and retention. Training providers are incentivised to support outcomes through onboarding, counselling and alumni engagement.“Till we come out of our comfort zone, we can’t achieve anything,” says Ishrat. “At first, I wasn’t sure I could manage the machines,” says Puja, now a trainer. “Now I want girls in my village to see what’s possible.”Sakshi says her job gave her more than income, it gave her purpose. “I didn’t want my siblings to face what I did.” Simran says the job gave her confidence. “I feel I can take care of my dreams & my family’s needs too.” For them, skilling isn’t just about employment—it’s about identity, agency, and finding a place in the formal economy.","SIB aims to train 50,000 youth, with at least 30,150 retained in jobs for a minimum of three months.

NDA MPs slam SP silence over cleric’s remark against Dimple Yadav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-mps-slam-sp-silence-over-clerics-remark-against-dimple-yadav/articleshow/122965953.cms,"Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav

NEW DELHI : It was an unusual sight. Holding placards and shouting slogans, NDA MPs Monday staged a protest over All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi’s objectionable remarks against opposition Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav , with party chief Akhilesh Yadav criticising the cleric.“ Jo Lok Sabha mein pahen ke ayenge wohi humari har jagah dress ho gi (whatever I will wear to attend Lok Sabha, will be my dress for everywhere else),” Akhilesh said while responding to a media query over the issue.MPs of governing NDA said the cleric’s purported remark protesting against the SP MP for not fully covering herself during a recent visit to a mosque was an insult to women as a whole, and questioned the “silence” of the opposition.Dimple, however, was not impressed and said it’s good that action is being taken now but it would have been better if similar protests and support had been visible when horrifying incidents like the one in Manipur came to light through footage on social media, she said.In Lucknow, an FIR has been lodged based on a complaint by local resident Pravesh Yadav, who accused Rashidi of making “extremely offensive, inflammatory, and anti-women remarks” that were “derogatory and misogynistic” and aimed at “inciting religious disharmony & communal tension”.Talking to reporters, LJP (R) MP Shambhavi Choudhary said that for NDA, the honour and prestige of women is of utmost priority.Maulana Rashid had purportedly made misogynistic comments against Dimple in a TV debate and had praised another SP MP, Iqra Hasan, who had covered her head inside the mosque. The comments led to condemnation on social media and from women MPs, including BJP’s Bansuri Swaraj and Congress’s Renuka Chowdhury.The NDA MPs, especially women members, held a protest near Makar Dwar in the Parliament House complex, raising slogans like ‘ Nari shakti ka apman, nahin sahega Hindustan ’.Swaraj called the remarks “deeply shameful” and “unacceptable”. “Does opposition agree with this indecent remark? It is deeply shameful that such an offensive and inappropriate comment has been made against asitting MP...,” she said.She accused the opposition of prioritising “appeasement politics” over women’s dignity and affirmed that the NDA would continue to raise its voice for every woman, including Dimple Yadav.","All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi’s objectionable remarks against opposition Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav.

‘Those who are impure can't visit mosque': Muslim body writes to Delhi CM Rekha Gupta after SP Parliament meet; seeks imam's Nadvi removal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/those-who-are-impure-cant-visit-mosque-muslim-body-writes-to-delhi-cm-rekha-gupta-after-sp-parliament-meet-seeks-imams-nadvi-removal/articleshow/122945509.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The president of the All India Muslim Jamaat, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, has written to Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta demanding the removal of Maulana Mohibbullah Nadvi from his position as imam of a mosque in the national capital.His demand comes days after a Samajwadi Party (SP) meeting was allegedly held inside the mosque, where Nadvi serves as imam and is also the SP Member of Parliament from Rampur, Uttar Pradesh.In his letter, Barelvi said: ""By holding a meeting of Samajwadi Party inside the mosque, the sanctity of the mosque has been violated, and the religious faith of the Muslims has been hurt.""""No other work can be done inside the mosque except offering prayers to the God,"" he added.According to Barelvi, the SP meeting was attended by party chief Akhilesh Yadav , his wife and MP Dimple Yadav, MPs Dharmendra Yadav, Ziaur Rahman Barq, and other leaders.""Impure people cannot come inside the mosque. Only those people can come to the mosque who are pure,"" he wrote.He also pointed out that two women participated in the meeting, despite entry being ""prohibited inside the mosque.""A religious place like a mosque was used for politics.Through this meeting a political message was given that the Samajwadi Party is sympathetic to Muslims,"" Barelvi added.""Therefore, I demand from you that the Imam of the mosque, Maulana Mohibbullah Nadvi, should be removed from the 'Imamat', and a person with Sufi ideology should be made the Imam who is not political,"" he concluded.Meanwhile, the BJP's minority morcha has also taken issue with Nadvi's dual role as imam and MP. Its president, Jamal Siddiqui, has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, seeking Nadvi’s disqualification from Parliament on the grounds that he allegedly holds an ""office of profit"" by drawing a salary from the Waqf Board.Under Article 102(1)(a) of the Constitution, Siddiqui claimed, Nadvi’s position could be considered an office of profit ""because it is financed by a statutory body under the Delhi government.""Siddiqui also wrote to Delhi CM Gupta demanding Nadvi’s immediate removal, accusing him of ""using the mosque as his personal property.""""On July 22, 2025, Mohibbullah Nadvi, along with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, his wife, Dharmendra Yadav and other MPs, party workers, held a party meeting at the mosque where Namaz is offered and also had tea and snacks, which is against the Islamic model code of conduct,"" Siddiqui stated.He further alleged: ""Nadvi also took SP MP Dimple Yadav to the mosque, even though the entry of women is prohibited there.""""There is a place on the first floor of (the mosque) for women to sit. It is worth noting that Dimple Yadav's dress was also against the rules of the mosque,"" he claimed.""Mohibbullah Nadvi is using this mosque as his personal property and is promoting Samajwadi Party there, which cannot be done as an Imam,"" Siddiqui said.",Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi has written to Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.

Massive Rescue Operation: Over 300 Trekkers Saved in Maharashtra's Malshej Ghat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/over-300-trekkers-rescued-in-maharashtras-malshej-ghat-kalu-river-surge-traps-group-locals-forest-teams-lead-7-hour-operation/articleshow/122935040.cms,"



PUNE: Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the Thane and Junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers during a seven-hour operation on Saturday at Wagachiwadi village in the Malshej Ghat region. This area lies on the border between Pune and Thane districts, about 150 km from Pune, near the Kalyan-Ahmednagar highway.The trekkers came from Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the Kalu River’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall in the afternoon, according to forest officials and locals. The forest officials were notified of their entrapment after receiving a call from the state disaster management cell and district administrations.The rescue operation was particularly hazardous, as locals had to swim through the rushing waters to secure ropes and harnesses to trees, using a zipline to transport individuals across the river. Bhaskar Mengal (24), a villager from Morushi village who played a crucial role in the rescue, told TOI, “The river water was gushing, and there was no other way to reach the other side. Since I am familiar with the local conditions, I swam across the river to tie ropes and a harness to the trees.The tourists were scared, and tensions were high. I had to calm them down.”“I prioritised rescuing women. Since we were using the zipline to cross the river, I had to explain the technique to them and assure them that they would not fall. We successfully sent them across one by one. Eventually, another villager, Kamlu Pokla, and forest guards joined me.” Pokla, who has successfully rescued several stranded tourists in the past, added, “During the night, the tourists began to panic and were hesitant to follow our instructions as everybody wanted to go to the other side. We had to calm them down before rescuing them from the deep forest.”Forest officials said that the tourists ventured into the restricted dense forest that Saturday morning without consulting locals. “They were unaware of the local conditions, which led to their entrapment when the river’s water level suddenly increased within a few hours. This area is extremely treacherous and risky for visitors,” Rajvardhan Bhosale, the Range Forest Officer of the Tokavade forest range in Thane district, told TOI.The rescue operation began at 3 PM and concluded by 10 PM, successfully bringing everyone to safety. Most tourists prefer to approach the Kalu River waterfall from the Murbad tehsil side because the trek to the waterfall is steep. However, this particular zone is located within a reserved forest area, home to a large population of wildlife, including leopards and venomous snakes, said the forest officials.Smita Rajhans, assistant forest officer of the Junnar forest division, said, “As many tourists share videos on social media, an increasing number of visitors from other states are coming to Junnar and the surrounding areas for trekking to enjoy the rains. They often disregard their safety, neglect to hire locals for guidance, and attempt adventurous activities in these dense forest zones, leading to their entrapment as they miss the trails. ”The Malshej Ghat, Naneghat, and several villages in the Murbad tehsil of Thane district are known for their alluring jungle treks and trails. This region receives over 200 mm of rainfall within 24 hours, causing local streams, waterfalls, and rivulets to flow at capacity. Consequently, there are numerous small and medium-sized waterfalls in the area.“The natural beauty of these water bodies attracts tourists from various parts of the country, and even international visitors have started flocking to these spots. Hence, it has become imperative for us to enhance basic safety infrastructure in these locations,” said a senior forest official.Kalu Waterfall: The famous Kalu Waterfall is situated in the Khireshwar village, Junnar tehsil, approximately 150 km from Pune. Due to unfamiliarity with the region's geography, a tourist ventured too deep into the valley near the waterfall and accidentally fell into the rushing water at its base. The Kalu Waterfall, located in the Malshej Ghat region, is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors, especially from Mumbai and Pune, particularly during the monsoon season. With a height of 1,200 feet, the Kalu River cascades, making it one of the largest waterfalls in the region and the district.However, locals have voiced concerns about safety at the site, noting that inadequate safety measures have resulted in numerous fatalities. The area is prone to slippery patches and unstable rocks, raising the risk of accidents.Visitors are often drawn to the site due to videos shared on social media, compelling them to capture their experiences.Past Incidents: On July 12, a group of local youths rescued a youth from Hyderabad at Kalu Waterfall. On June 6, a 23-year-old woman tragically lost her life after falling into a 150-foot-deep gorge while trekking at Rajgad Fort in the evening hours.On July 13, six trekkers lost their way while descending from Visapur Fort in Lonavala. The members of the local rescue team rescued them. They were in the forest for almost four hours. In 2022, a software engineer (33) from Hyderabad experienced a scare after losing his way during a solo trek on a 30 km treacherous route from Sonavelu village in Murbad tehsil of Thane to Konkan Kada in Junnar, passing through hilly and forest areas.","Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the Thane and Junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers. The trekkers came from Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the Kalu River’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall.

The company will provide affected staff with severance benefits, outplacement services, and extended insurance coverage.

TCS Layoffs : What’s Behind The Move?

TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year. This is nearly a 2% reduction in the workforce of the IT giant, an unprecedented number for the IT firm.In an official statement, TCS told ET, “TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.”In the April-June quarter, the leading six IT companies saw 72% reduction in workforce expansion, with only 3,847 new hires, compared to 13,935 recruitments during the January-March period.India's IT services sector, which generates combined revenues of over $283 billion, has software companies ranked amongst the biggest private employers. TCS leads as the largest employer in this segment.According to the report, ongoing economic uncertainties and disruptions caused by AI technologies are impacting business demands.The Tata group subsidiary, based in Mumbai, has a total employee count of 613,069 at the close of June 2025.According to a Reuters report, the layoffs will majorly affect people in the middle to senior management positions and around 12,200 people will be asked to leave.According to HFS Research's CEO Phil Fersht, artificial intelligence is diminishing the labour-intensive service delivery approach in the industry.""(That model) is forcing large service providers such as TCS to rebalance their workforces to maintain profit margins and stay price-competitive in a cut-throat market where clients are demanding 20-30% price reductions,"" Fersht was quoted by Reuters.He further noted that this action by TCS, known for providing stable employment, underscores this industry-wide development.The impacted employees who will be asked leave will be provided with notice period compensation and extra severance benefits. Additionally, TCS plans to provide insurance coverage extension and career transition assistance to those affected by this decision, the report said.TCS also said, “This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities.""This workforce reduction comes within days of many TCS staff employees initiating legal proceedings challenging the company's modified bench policy. The revised policy stipulates that employees can only remain unbilled for 35 days annually and must achieve a minimum of 225 billable days per year.Recently it was reported that TCS has delayed the onboarding of 600 lateral hires. TCS issued a notice regarding 'indefinite delay', without providing any new joining dates for the selected technology professionals.NITES (Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate) has escalated this matter to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya through a written communication, highlighting concerns about the financial difficulties and psychological stress faced by these professionals due to the uncertain situation.TCS announced its comprehensive strategic approach, which includes investments in emerging technologies, market expansion, large-scale AI implementation for clients and internal operations, strengthening partnerships, developing advanced infrastructure and restructuring their employment framework.To achieve these objectives, various programmes focused on skill enhancement and staff reallocation have been initiated and are currently in progress.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year.

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders.

"NEP@5: More learners, more women, more languages - But can it deliver on its full promise?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep5-more-learners-more-women-more-languages-but-can-it-deliver-on-its-full-promise/articleshow/122962219.cms,"NEW DELHI: Foundational reading and arithmetic skills among Class III students in govt schools have recorded their strongest gains in nearly two decades, with rural learners outperforming their urban peers - indicating grassroots-level progress. In higher education, enrolment has increased by over 30.5% since 2015, with female PhD enrolment more than doubling and significant gains among SC, ST, minority and Northeast students, as the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 begins reshaping India's education system.However, five years on, the policy continues to face political resistance from some opposition-ruled states, which have raised concerns over centralisation and language. While 35 universities have begun transitioning into multidisciplinary institutions with central support, the uptake of reforms such as multiple entry-exit options remains limited - underlining both early momentum and implementation hurdles.In schools, the biggest shift has been the integration of pre-school into the '5+3+3+4 structure'. As of 2024, more than 1.1 crore children are enrolled in 'Balvatikas', up from 50 lakh in 2018.Over 4.2 crore students across 8.9 lakh schools have participated in 'Vidya Pravesh', a 12-week play-based module for Grade 1 readiness. With 496 Kendriya Vidyalayas now offering 'Balvatikas' and 121 multilingual primers developed, early education has gained structured support.The Nipun Bharat Mission, launched in 2021 to improve foundational literacy and numeracy, is beginning to yield outcomes. ASER 2024 showed that 23.4% of Class III students in govt schools can now read a Grade II-level text - the highest since 2005 - up from 16.3% in 2022. Arithmetic scores have also improved - 27.6% of students can now perform basic subtraction, up from 20.2% in 2022. The Parakh national survey found rural students outperforming their urban counterparts in both reading and math.More than 14 lakh teachers have been trained under the Nishtha foundational programme. The 'Jaadui Pitara' - a multilingual play-based teaching kit - has been distributed in 22 Indian languages. However, just over half of govt and aided schools offer preschool, and aligning curriculum with infrastructure remains a challenge.In higher education, NEP's emphasis on flexibility is reflected in the rollout of the academic bank of credit (ABC), multiple entry-exit options and biannual admissions. As of July 2025, over 32 crore ABC IDs have been generated and 2,556 institutions onboarded. The new biannual admission cycle is expected to ease transitions and reduce dropouts.Between 2014-15 and 2022-23, higher education enrolment increased from 3.42 crore to 4.46 crore. Female enrolment increased 38.4%, from 1.57 crore to 2.18 crore. Female PhD enrolment jumped 135.6%, from 48,000 to 1.12 lakh. SC student enrolment rose by 50% and ST enrolment by 75%. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) among SCs increased from 18.9 lakh to 27.3 lakh, and among STs from 13.5 lakh to 23.5 lakh.Access also improved among minorities. Muslim student enrolment grew by 46.3%, from 15.3 lakh to 22.4 lakh, and other minorities by 61%, from 6.5 lakh to 10.5 lakh. The Northeast saw a 36% increase, with female students now slightly outnumbering males.Still, the transformation of single-discipline institutions has lagged. Though 35 universities have received Rs 100 crore each under PM-Usha, many engineering and teacher education colleges are yet to realign. Gaps in faculty development, curriculum design and infrastructure persist.While 153 universities offer multiple entry and 74 allow early exit, only about 31,000 undergraduates and 5,500 postgraduates have used these options so far - suggesting structural reforms are outpacing student uptake.","In higher education, enrolment has increased by over 30.5% since 2015, with female PhD enrolment more than doubling.

Government throws open IITs for students from gurukuls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-throws-open-iits-for-students-from-gurukuls/articleshow/122961118.cms,"NEW DELHI: Students who have studied in traditional gurukuls, even without formal academic degrees, will now have the opportunity to earn recognised qualifications and receive generous scholarships for research at premier IITs. The move marks a major shift in India's education policy, opening up elite research pathways for scholars from non-formal backgrounds rooted in classical learning.The initiative, titled 'Setubandha Vidwan Yojana', aims to bridge India's age-old gurukul tradition with modern scientific and academic inquiry. Backed by the ministry of education and implemented by the Indian Knowledge System (IKS) division of the Central Sanskrit University (CSU), the scheme offers fellowships of up to Rs 65,000 per month across 18 interdisciplinary fields - from ayurveda to cognitive science, and architecture to political theory, grammar to strategic studies, performing arts to mathematics, physics, and health sciences.""Setubandha is the first national-level programme to formally integrate traditional scholars into the research ecosystem of IITs, without insisting on conventional degrees. Instead, eligibility is based on a minimum of five years of rigorous study in a recognised gurukul and demonstrable excellence in Shastras or traditional knowledge,"" said a senior MoE official. The maximum age to apply is 32 years.Scholars selected under Category 1 (equivalent to postgraduate level) will receive a monthly fellowship of Rs 40,000 and an annual research grant of Rs 1 lakh.Those under Category 2 (equivalent to PhD level) will be awarded Rs 65,000 monthly and an annual grant of Rs 2 lakh. Some of the recognised research areas include Anvikshiki Vidya (philosophy and cognitive science), Ganit-Bhaut-Jyotish Vidya (mathematics, physics, astronomy), and Bhaishajya and Arogya Vidya (Ayurveda and health sciences).The scheme marks a significant institutional recognition of traditional knowledge systems, which for decades have operated outside formal academic structures. The NE explicitly calls for the integration of Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) into mainstream curricula and research, encouraging cross-disciplinary studies rooted in the country's intellectual heritage. With increasing global interest in ayurveda, yoga, Sanskrit linguistics, and indigenous governance systems, the govt sees this initiative as a way to empower traditional scholars and harness centuries-old wisdom for modern applications in science, technology, and social policy.In 2020, India more than just released a policy - it rekindled an ancient ideal. National Education Policy (NEP) placed learning at the heart of nation building, drawing from civilisational wisdom. Framed through one of the most participatory policy-making processes in history under late K Kasturirangan's guidance, NE was a visionary roadmap rooted in cultural values. It reimagined learning as a process free from confines of rote memorisation, rigid structures, and linguistic hierarchies. It set the stage for a holistic, inclusive and future-ready education system.Five years on, NEP's impact is visible in policy corridors and classrooms. In early childhood classrooms, play-based learning is displacing rote memorisation; children read fluently in their mother tongue; Class 6 students explore hands-on skills in vocational labs. Its imprint is visible in research hubs where India's knowledge systems engage in dialogue with cutting-edge science. NEP's vision is reflected in the rise of women in STEM fields and in the growing global presence of Indian institutions.Nipun Bharat Mission has improved learning outcomes, ensuring foundational literacy and numeracy by Class 2. Nipun Bharat's success, reflected in Aser 2024 and Parakh Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024, has made classrooms spaces of curiosity and comprehension. Initiatives like Vidya Pravesh and institutionalisation of Balvatikas will help integrate early childhood care and education. Add to this new-age textbooks and introduction of Jaadui Pitara and e-Jaadui Pitara in 22 Indian languages. Over 14L teachers have completed Nishtha training, and platforms like Diksha have expanded access to teaching resources.NEP recognised language is not a hurdle but a powerful medium of empowerment. With 117 language primers developed and Indian Sign Language introduced as a subject, vision of multilingual, inclusive education is being realised at scale. Bhartiya Bhasha Pustak Yojana and National Digital Depository for Indian Knowledge Systems will democratise access to linguistic and civilisational learning.National Curriculum Framework for School Education and new textbooks for Classes 1 to 8 are in place. Prerna is a bridge programme to help curriculum transition and ensure students aren't overwhelmed but supported at each stage of their learning journey.Centrally sponsored schemes like Samagra Shiksha and PM Poshan have helped achieve near-universal enrolment. NEP's reach has extended to underserved populations. More than 7.12L girls from disadvantaged groups are enrolled in over 5,138 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas. Over 490 hostels have been sanctioned for PVTG learners and 692 hostels under Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan. Prashast, a programme that screens for disability, helps the schooling system become more resilient and inclusive.A key driver of the transformation under NE are 14,500 PM Shri schools. These modern, inclusive and green institutions are being developed as exemplary schools aligned with NEP's vision, redefining both infra and pedagogy. The Vidyanjali platform has connected over 8.2L schools with more than 5.3L volunteers and 2,000 CSR partners, directly benefitting 1.7cr students. In higher education, total enrolment has risen from 3.42cr to 4.46cr, a 30.5% increase. Women now comprise nearly 48% of all students, and female PhD enrolment has more than doubled from 0.48L to 1.12L. This expansion in enrolment, especially for SC, ST, OBC, and minority students, marks a historic achievement for inclusivity in higher education. Female GER has surpassed male GER for six consecutive years.Introducing Multiple Entry and Exit, Academic Bank of Credits with over 21.12cr APAAR IDs issued, and National Credit Framework have together provided flexibility and mobility. With 153 universities offering multiple entry and 74 multiple exit options, learning is not linear but modular and student-driven.NEP's emphasis on research and innovation has improved India's Global Innovation Index rank from 81st to 39th. Over 18,000 startups have been incubated across 400 HEIs. Anusandhan NRF, revamped PMRF 2.0, and the ₹6k cr One Nation One Subscription initiative show a commitment to decentralise access to research.Tech platforms like Swayam and Swayam Plus have recorded over 5.3cr enrolments. Support of Diksha and PM e-Vidya with over 200 DTH Channels ensures high-quality content is available countrywide. Digital learning ecosystem's success, including biannual admissions and dual degree regulations, has made higher education more inclusive, interdisciplinary, and industry-relevant. In QS World University Rankings 2026, 54 Indian institutions made the list, up from just 11 in 2014. Global universities Deakin, Wollongong, and Southampton have set up campuses in India.The journey of transformation is being celebrated through Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Samagam, but is being measured in the quiet confidence of learners, teachers, and parents. We must continue to green our campuses, expand critical research infra, and deepen learning outcomes. Under PM's leadership, education is not just policy but the greatest national investment. Where there is learning, there is progress. A billion minds unshackled and empowered aren't just a demographic dividend, but New India's supernova.","The initiative, titled 'Setubandha Vidwan Yojana', aims to bridge India's age- old gurukul tradition with modern scientific and academic inquiry.

No pollution data from Haryana as all state AQI stations offline since April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-pollution-data-from-haryana-as-all-state-aqi-stations-offline-since-april/articleshow/122963786.cms,"No pollution data from Haryana as all state AQI stations offline since April

Gurgaon staring at no alerts, no enforcement in smog season

GURGAON: A large chunk of Delhi's neighbourhood has been pollution-blind since April and could remain so when toxic air over the region peaks in Oct-Nov, severely undermining mitigation strategies over India's most polluted airshed.All 29 air quality monitoring stations in Haryana operated by state pollution control board (HSPCB) have been offline since April 2 this year. The state's pollution data, meanwhile, has been coming from just two stations of the India Meteorological Department, one in Gurgaon and the other in Panchkula.HSPCB stations are offline because the board let the maintenance contract with the firm that had managed monitors for five years lapse without lining up a stopgap fix. Air monitoring stations began going offline after Oct 31 last year. By Dec 31, nearly 50% of the stations had stopped recording data, which is used by HSPCB and Central Pollution Control Board to issue daily pollution bulletins and by CAQM to formulate strategies for bad-air days.The stations progressively went on the blink till the whole network went down on April 2.On days when the IMD stations don’t record air quality because of glitches or other reasons, the state has no pollution data.This happened in Gurgaon for several days this month when the IMD station in Gwalpahari wasn’t working. A tender floated in May 2025 for an operator drew only one bidder. The bid was automatically disqualified under govt’s procurement rules that require at least two bidders for competitive selection. According to officials, the second round of tenders is still being prepared and is expected to be issued this week with a late-Aug deadline for submissions.Once bids are received, a lengthy evaluation follows. The process involves technical scrutiny, financial review, clearance by a high-powered committee and finally approval from the chief minister’s office. That, according to officials, could take 60 to 90 days. That means Haryana could enter peak smog season without real-time AQI data, without which there can be no alerts, no enforcement and no public warnings. These are all critical to Grap (graded response action plan), which usually comes into force from Oct 15.“There should have been a contingency plan. Even if you want to bring in a new vendor, you don’t shut off surveillance entirely. That’s like switching off CCTV in a high-crime zone because you are changing the camera vendor,” a senior HSPCB official admitted.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at Envirocatalysts, emphasised the importance of timely administrative decisions on bids for new contracts. “Decisions on opening bids for new contracts for govt services are usually planned well before the existing one ends, especially for maintaining such critical infrastructure as air quality monitoring in a state like Haryana, which lies in one of the most polluted areas. It’s unfortunate that this happened, but it should serve as a reminder to plan better for the future and for other states,” he said.Asked about it, HSPCB chairman Vineet Garg said the board has changed certain conditions in the tender and will be floating it by the end of July.While Grap’s implementation is based on Delhi’s AQI data, anti-pollution measures are enforced in all NCR cities after analysing indices recorded by local air monitors.“This blackout is likely to have serious consequences. Winter is the most polluted time of year in Haryana, with air quality often slipping into ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’ category due to stagnant weather, crop residue burning and fossil fuel emissions. Without functioning monitors, district authorities can’t track local AQI levels, identify pollution spikes, decide when to implement pollution curbs,” said Shubhansh Tiwari, research associate at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), adding that the state would essentially be forced to rely on Delhi data.The implication goes beyond Grap. Under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and its state-specific pollution control action plans, govt must track, report and demonstrate year-on-year improvements in air quality, all of which are data-dependent.Manoj Kumar, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said with the entire network rendered non-functional, there is growing concern about the progress, or lack thereof, made over the past six months. “In the absence of real-time data, it is tough to assess if efforts are underway to restore the monitoring system ahead of the upcoming peak pollution season. This gap in information affects both public awareness and the ability to evaluate policy response,” Kumar added.The two monitors in Gurgaon and Panchkula cover just a fraction of the state’s urban and industrial landscape. “You can’t extrapolate Delhi’s air to Karnal or Hisar,” said a senior officer who is part of the clean air programme. “The pollution sources, local weather patterns, and emissions vary. A single reading from Gurgaon tells you nothing about what’s happening in Yamunanagar or Panipat,” he said. For that matter, a station in one part of a large city won't even capture the picture in another part of it.A study of the air quality data by CREA found that Jan 19, 2025, was Gurgaon’s “overshoot day”. By then, PM 2.5 concentration was already so high that even if levels were to drastically reduce to zero for the rest of the year, the city would still fail to meet the acceptable limit specified by World Health Organisation (WHO). The analysis ranked Gurgaon as the fifth most polluted Indian city in the first half of 2025.",All 29 air quality monitoring stations in Haryana operated by state pollution control board (HSPCB) have been offline since April 2 this year. HSPCB stations are offline because the board let the maintenance contract with the firm that had managed monitors for five years lapse without lining up a stopgap fix.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122963811,imgsize-1010337,width-400,resizemode-4/122963811.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The time has come for Delhi government to take a comprehensive decision on how civic services should be managed, the high court said Monday, citing the ""enormous confusion"" among various agencies, even on the key issue of controlling waterlogging. This, it said, had led to ""passing the buck on most occasions"".It cited a ""glaring example"" of such confusion in the way stormwater drains fall under PWD, while sewage line maintenance is under MCD, lamenting that this has ""led to non-maintenance of either of the lines, leading to excessive flooding in Delhi"".""Neither of these drain pipes is being properly managed by the respective agency, which seems to be passing the responsibility to the other agency,"" a special bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Manmeet PS Arora noted.In most colonies, it added, stormwater drains were also blocked by residents or constructions, leaving them ""perpetually clogged"". Directing that its order be sent to the chief secretary, who in turn should place it before the highest functionaries of Delhi government, the court said the authorities must decide on centralising the administration and management of drains. If required, the matter would be placed before Delhi's lieutenant governor, the court added.The high court was hearing two suo motu petitions dealing with waterlogging and rainwater harvesting, besides easing traffic jams in the national capital during the monsoon and at other times of the year.In the pending petition, a fresh plea was filed by the Residents Welfare Association of Maharani Bagh, saying a new problem arose due to the action of the Delhi govt's public works department (PWD). The court has been examining various aspects related to the Taimur Nagar drain adjacent to Maharani Bagh colony and has been issuing directions from time to time.During the latest hearing, the bench was informed that certain well marks or holes were made in the walls on the ring road through which water flowed into the Maharani Bagh colony, flooding the area.The PWD argued that these were not new holes but well marks that already existed and were blocked by the residents and had now been opened. The court was also informed that the road was earlier with the PWD and is now with the MCD.The court noted that the residents' plea showed the apathy prevalent in Delhi due to multiple agencies functioning and pointed out that it has to summon agencies, including MCD, PWD, DJB, DDA, and the Irrigation and Flood Control Department, before it for a consensus to be arrived at, and for effective implementation of its directions.""Between these agencies, there is enormous confusion, which is caused due to improper delineation of responsibilities, leading to passing the buck on most occasions,"" the court said. On the Maharani Bagh issue, the bench directed the PWD and MCD to hold a meeting with the residents on Aug 2 after conducting a site inspection and file a joint status report on the efforts to solve the issue.The high court also sought the presence of an official from AIIMS to answer why there was a delay in clearances relating to the laying down of a new sewer pipeline in the area.","Delhi high court cites ""enormous confusion"" among various agencies.

During the workshop, discussions were held and states/UTs were advised to take corrective measures"".The ministry not releasing the survey findings has remained a mystery considering that govt holds similar surveys across sectors to ensure ""healthy competition"" among states and cities.Interestingly, on Feb 27, 2024, months after the workshop with states and UTs, the ministry had issued a detailed press release announcing that the ""first Pey Jal Survekshan Awards"" would be held on March 5, with President Droupadi Murmu scheduled to preside over the event.

"Government to overhaul accreditation system, operationalise AI centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-overhaul-accreditation-system-operationalise-ai-centre/articleshow/122962055.cms,"NEW DELHI: Marking five years of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre is set to announce a major reform in the accreditation system for higher education institutions by shifting to a binary model - 'accredited' or 'not accredited' - replacing the existing multi-tiered grading system. This means institutions will no longer be ranked against each other but assessed against uniform minimum standards.On the anvil is also the launch of a new 'Bharatiya Bhasha' digital tool for direct translations between Indian languages, bypassing English as a mediator. In addition, govt will operationalise a Centre of Excellence in AI in education, as announced in the 2025 Union Budget.These announcements are expected to be made on Tuesday at a national event commemorating the fifth anniversary of NEP-2020, in the presence of senior ministers, educationists and state representatives at the Bharat Mandapam here.The new accreditation model aims at simplifying the process and encourage wider participation among higher education institutions (HEIs). Unlike the earlier framework, which graded institutions (A++, A, B, etc.), the new binary system will require institutions to meet basic benchmarks to qualify as 'accredited'. A senior education ministry official said, ""The change was designed to address the reluctance of many HEIs to apply for accreditation due to the effort involved and uncertainty about securing a favourable grade.The shift comes in the wake of concerns over credibility and participation in the current accreditation regime, particularly following recent controversies around the functioning of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (Naac). Inconsistent grading patterns and allegations of opacity had drawn criticism from academics and policymakers, prompting a rethink of the process.Elaborating on the new approach, the official said, ""Under the new model, all institutions that meet benchmark standards will be treated equally in the first phase. Grading from 1 to 5 will follow in the second stage, expected to begin in the next five to six months. Institutions will climb the grading ladder sequentially - starting from Grade 1 - based on verified performance data.""The data validation will rely on a triangulation method, using multiple sources and tools to ensure accuracy, and will exclude Naac's direct involvement. Instead, only govt agencies and Institutions of National Importance will be engaged for verification, and there will be no physical inspections.The 'Bharatiya Bhasha' digital tool will allow seamless translations between Indian languages without routing through English - for instance, enabling direct translation from Assamese to Tamil. In higher education, the Centre of Excellence in AI in education is set to be formally launched to support research and integration of AI tools in teaching and learning.For school education, announcements are expected on targeted infrastructure improvement and expansion of access, including new buildings for Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas, with corresponding funding support.","New binary model - 'accredited' or 'not accredited' - to replace existing multi- tiered grading system.

For established procedures or high-risk cases, it said, recordings should be preferred.The NMC has, however, effectively turned down demands to ban live surgeries which has been criticised by many as a tool that is used by surgeons to flaunt their skills and for companies to promote their products, all at the expense of patient safety.A petition was also filed in the matter in Supreme Court recently, which prompted the NMC to constitute a committee to give its recommendations on how to regulate the conducting of live surgery broadcasts. The NMC guideline has been prepared on the basis of the committee's report, officials said.Patients participating in live surgeries are not entitled to any financial incentive currently. The new guideline upholds this practice. But it added such patients can be enrolled in insurance coverage to safeguard against any unforeseen incidents during live surgery/ procedures.It said patients should not incur any charges related to the surgery or procedures, including implants, medications, disposables, and procedures, and surgery-related complications should also be managed free of cost.Live surgery refers to real-time broadcasting of surgical procedures to an audience, typically for educational or training purposes.The NMC accepted concerns raised by many questioning its utility. Live surgery, it noted, may seem valuable for experiential learning. However, it lacks concrete evidence supporting its educational effectiveness when compared to pre-recorded surgical videos. ""Pre-recorded videos offer better frame-by-frame analysis, video editing and labelling and, thus, enhancing the educational experience,"" it pointed out and recommended that promoting recorded video, wet lab, cadaveric and simulation-based surgeries/procedures as these entails no risk to the patient instead.Proponents of live broadcasts of surgeries say it helps students and surgeons wanting to up skill, sitting in a remote location and watching highly magnified and high-resolution images of the nuances and intricacies of surgical techniques.This is a globally accepted method of learning and because of this, surgeries which were available to only a few in top hospitals and teaching institutes in private or govt sectors are now being practiced in tier two and tier three towns, those supporting live surgeries say, and the same has been noted in the NMC guideline which essentially brings in stricter regulations while allowing it in a limited way.","The National Medical Commission (NMC) has clamped down on live surgeries, except those involving new procedures.

Jaishankar’s Savage Declaration Of War At QUAD Meeting: ‘India Will Defend Its People’ | Watch

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution.

We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution. 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday.

According to reports, he has been missing for past two weeks.

Who is Julian Brown ?

'I know that I'm not going to live long'







A young inventor from metro Atlanta, Julian Brown, has gone missing for nearly two weeks shortly after he posted a cryptic message that he was ""certainly under attack"". Brown recently rose to fame for his ingestion of 'Plastoline' a technology that converts plastics into gasoline or other usable fuels like diesel, jet fuel etc. Brown, on his social media, posted that some ""very, very odd stuff"" was happening to him and he was ""certainly under attack"".This tell-tale post was shared from his account on July 9. He asked his followers to keep their eyes open as he could not reveal anything else at that time. He said he was still working and building and nothing would stop him.Social media users raised alarm that something bad might have happened to Julian because of what he was creating. ""The influencer and scientist Julian Brown also known as naturejab did not post anything after around 2 weeks. His last post was a leak of his drivers license. He produced gasoline out of plastic waste and was concerned people will try to stop him,"" one wrote. FBI director Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino were tagged on social media posts urging the FBI leadership to look for Julian Brown.Not much is known about the disappearance of the young inventor.It is also not confirmed whether his disappearance is only from social media as there is no report of any missing report filed so far.Julian Brown is a 21-year-old inventor from Chicago, known for developing a process to convert plastic waste into fuel, specifically an alternative to diesel called ""Plastoline."" He is the founder of Naturejab, a company focused on environmental solutions, and Jabaroma, a business producing 100% natural body products. Brown has been recognized as a 776 Climate Fellow and is based in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. His work involves microwave pyrolysis of plastic waste to create fuel, which he showcased on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.One particular video of Julian Brown is doing the rounds in which he said he won't live long, and that's why he puts every minute into building and into growing. In this video, he said he saw a helicopter circling him in a remote location. He said he was also falsely reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency. ""I do this because this is my mission. I do not fear death,"" he said in that video.","Julian Brown is a 21-year-old inventor from Chicago.

The UAE has built its name as a hub for global talent. While many expats come to work, not everyone who wants to live here is looking for a job. And the good news is, you don’t need a work visa or local sponsor to stay in the country legally.The government has rolled out several visa options that let you live in the UAE without being tied to an employer. Whether you're working remotely, planning to retire, running a freelance business, or investing in property, there’s a pathway designed for people like you.So if you’re wondering how to move to the UAE without a job offer, this guide is for you. Let’s break down the most realistic options available now, what they cost, who’s eligible, and what you need to apply.The Non-Working Visa is designed for people who want to live in the UAE but do not plan to work during their stay. Unlike typical employment visas, this visa doesn’t require you to have a job or a sponsor. It’s ideal for retirees, investors, or anyone who wants to live here while supporting themselves through other means.This visa usually comes with financial requirements. You may need to prove you have a certain level of income or savings to cover your living expenses.In some cases, owning property in the UAE can also support your application.The non-working visa is typically valid for one to five years, depending on the specific category and your eligibility. It offers flexibility and allows you to legally reside in the UAE without engaging in local employment. It’s also renewable if you continue to meet the conditions.Keep in mind, while the non-working visa lets you live in the UAE, it doesn’t grant work rights. So if you want to take on local employment, you’d need a different type of visa.If you have a remote job or run a business outside the UAE, this visa lets you live in the Emirates for a year while working remotely. You’ll need to show proof of your employment or business, like contracts, payslips, and bank statements. Your income should be at least $3,500 a month, and you must have health insurance covering you in the UAE. Also, your passport needs at least six months’ validity.A key point is that you must enter the UAE at least once every six months to keep this visa active. The cost is roughly USD 287 plus health insurance, and the visa is renewable yearly if you continue to meet the requirements.For those 55 and older, or with 15 or more years of work experience, the retirement visa allows you to live in the UAE without working. You must meet financial conditions such as having a monthly income of about AED 20,000 (or AED 15,000 if living in Dubai), or holding AED 1 million (about $272,000 USD) in savings or property, or a combination of both totaling AED 1 million.This visa lasts five years and can be renewed as long as you keep meeting the criteria. It also lets you sponsor your spouse and dependents. Processing usually takes one to two weeks, with fees covering the visa, medical tests, and Emirates ID.This is for investors, entrepreneurs, talented professionals, creatives, and exceptional students. The Golden Visa grants long-term residency, typically five or ten years, and lets you sponsor your family without a local sponsor. To qualify, you need to meet specific criteria, such as investing at least AED 2 million in property or business or proving recognized expertise in your field.Costs vary widely depending on your category, sometimes up to AED 100,000 ($27,200 USD), and simply paying fees doesn’t guarantee approval. But the benefits include flexible stay requirements, the ability to open bank accounts, get a UAE driver’s license, and lease property.If you want to live in the UAE and work independently, the freelance visa is a popular option. You register as a freelancer through a free zone like Dubai Media City or Fujairah Creative City, and then get your residency visa as part of the process. This allows you to legally work for clients inside and outside the UAE without needing an employer.The visa usually lasts between one and three years, depending on the free zone, and costs between AED 7,500($2,040 USD) and AED 18,000 ($4,860 USD). You can also sponsor family members on this visa.Yes. Several visa options, like the retirement visa, golden visa, or freelance visa, let you live in the UAE without employment.No. All the options listed above are sponsor-free. You apply directly through UAE government channels or designated free zones.Yes. Most of these visas allow you to sponsor your spouse and children, as long as you meet income or savings requirements.","The UAE offers several visa options for retirees, remote workers, freelancers, and investors.

New charge piles onto Johnny Somali’s legal nightmare in South Korea

4 Obstruction of Business charges

1 violation of the Special Act on the Punishment of Sexual Crimes

1 alleged breach of the Child Welfare Act

2 other undisclosed counts

How long could Johnny Somali spend in prison?

The default sentence is now 4 years and 9 months.

The aggravated minimum is 8 years and 4.5 months.

The aggravated maximum? A jaw-dropping 12 years in prison.

Internet reacts as Johnny’s charges mount

Controversial streamer Johnny Somali has once again landed in headlines, and not for content creation. On July 27, 2025, a new criminal charge was reportedly added to his growing rap sheet in South Korea, just weeks before his upcoming trial.Johnny Somali, whose real name is Ramsey Khalid Ismael, already faced serious legal trouble abroad. But this eighth charge is turning what was already a chaotic case into something much bigger.Legal Mindset, a YouTuber and lawyer closely tracking the case, broke the news during a livestream. He revealed that South Korean prosecutors had filed an additional count of Obstruction of Business, marking the fourth such count in Johnny’s legal list.For those counting:The most startling part? According to Legal Mindset, Johnny Somali had no idea about this new charge until the livestream dropped. Yes, the streamer reportedly found out about the development from YouTube, not the court.The sentencing possibilities are just as shocking as the charges. According to Legal Mindset’s breakdown:That’s a massive leap from the earlier two-year estimate. “That cannot be more wonderful,” the YouTuber said sarcastically, referring to what many online critics see as a long-overdue reckoning for the streamer’s disruptive behavior abroad.The streamer has long divided audiences, with some defending him as an entertainer and others labeling him a menace. His permanent ban from Kick, his controversial content history, and now, his ballooning list of charges in South Korea have made him one of the internet’s most infamous figures in 2025.As the court date inches closer, fans, critics, and legal spectators are all asking the same thing: Will this be the moment Johnny Somali finally faces the consequences?Only time and a South Korean courtroom will tell.","Johnny Somali, real name Ramsey Khalid Ismael, already faced serious legal trouble abroad.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.In related news, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Launched in 2018, this lab contributed to over 100 academic papers and helped develop a neural network framework that generated close to $1 billion in sales, according to a scientist at the lab.As reported by The Financial Times, the development was confirmed by Wang Minjie, a scientist at the lab, via a social media post on China's WeChat. The lab was established by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2018 and Wang stated that his team was being “dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid US-China tensions,” and reflected on the “golden era of foreign research labs” in China.",BlackRock has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

US Vice President JD Vance does not agree with the idea that AI will lead to mass unemployment . Speaking at the AI Action Summit in Paris, Vance said that “If the robots were coming to take all of our jobs, you would see it already.” Vance emphasised that the sign of a massive AI-driven job takeover would be far more evident if such a scenario were truly imminent. The remark from Vance is seen as a broader defense of Trump administration’s pro-worker AI strategy. Vance stressed on the fact that AI will augment human labour and not replace it. He also criticised the tech leaders who promote dystopian visions of mass layoffs.According to a report by Business Insider, Vice President JD Vance criticised what he called ‘doomsday narratives’ from tech leader who believe that AI will eventually lead to widespread layoffs. “Too many leaders in the AI industry, when they talk about this fear of replacing workers, miss the point,” he said. “AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free.”His comments suggest a belief that while AI will undoubtedly transform industries and job roles, a sudden, widespread elimination of human labour is not currently underway or immediately foreseeable.Instead of complete job destruction, JD Vance anticipate a period of job evolution. He emphasised that AI as a tool will augment human capabilities and will also help in creating new kinds of jobs and will also create demands for new type of skills.The Vice President's remarks come as discussions around AI's societal implications intensify, with concerns ranging from ethical considerations to economic disruption.

"Gold price prediction today: Where are gold rates headed on July 29, 2025 & ahead of Donald Trump's tariff deadline?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-july-29-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-donald-trump-tariff-deadline/articleshow/122964893.cms,"Gold price prediction: Spot gold is expected to trade with a slight bearish tilt unless US-China trade tensions surface up once again. (AI image)

Gold Price Performance:

On July 28, spot gold extended its decline to the fourth straight day as the European Union (EU) and the US announced that a trade deal framework has been reached under which 70% of the EU exports to the US will be subjected to 15% tariffs while reducing tariffs on some American goods to zero. In addition, the EU will buy huge amounts of US military equipment, invest fresh $600 billion in the US and purchase $750 billion of American energy products.

Although the US-EU trade deal has removed some uncertainty in the markets and mitigated risks to the global economy to an extent, some of the EU officials have criticized the deal as a compromise as even a 15% tariff rate will have significant negative consequences for the European economy.

Spot gold fell on reduced safe haven demand and a stronger US Dollar as the Euro tumbled on possible negative impacts of the deal on the Bloc's economy.

The yellow metal fell nearly 0.35% in the week ending July 25; thus, posting its second straight weekly decline.

The shiny metal at the time of writing was changing hands at $3314, down 0.68% for the day. The MCX October gold contract at Rs 98,400 was down around 0.35%.

Trade developments:

Following the deal with the EU, the effective US tariff rate stands at 16% currently, highest since the 1930s and six times the rate when Trump took office at the start of the year.

The US and China began two-day trade negotiation talks in Stockholm Monday. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Bessent will lead their delegations as the agenda is expected to include extension of current tariff truce, fentanyl trafficking and China buying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil.

India-US trade deal agreement is yet to be reached.

President Trump said that he may impose 15-20% tariffs on the nations which have yet to reach trade agreements.

US Dollar and yields:

The US Dollar Index extended its rebound for the third consecutive day on Monday as the Euro slumped nearly 1%.

extended its rebound for the third consecutive day on Monday as the Euro slumped nearly 1%. At the time of writing this article, the Index was noted at 98.41, up around 0.80% on the day. It is up nearly 1.60% in July, which is turning out to be its best month this year so far.

Ten-year US yields that fell around 3 bps last week, were up by 2 bps on Monday as the yields hovered around 4.41%.

Thirty-year yields at 4.95% were up 2 bps, too, though 2-year yields were steady at 3.93%.

Geopolitics:

US President Trump said that shortening his timeline for Russia to reach a truce to reach an agreement with Ukraine, he would make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days and would announce it by Tuesday.

According to defense analysts, the US, to signal Russia its commitment to the Europe’ security, has likely moved nuclear weapons to the UK for the first time since 2008.

ETF and COMEX gold stocks:

As of July 25, total known global gold ETF holdings reached a fresh cycle-high 91.83 MOz -- highest since July 31, 2023-- as ETFs recorded net inflows for the fifth straight day.

ETF holdings are up 10.77% YTD.

COMEX gold stocks at 37.76 MOz are down over 16% from the record-high level of 45.072 MOz reached on April 4.

Upcoming data and events:

This week is going to be quite a busy week as a raft of crucial macroeconomic data will be released amid key events like the FOMC monetary policy decision and trade news flow as the August 1 tariff deadline approaches.

Major US data on card include JOLTs job openings (June), Conference Board Consumer Confidence (July), ADP employment change (July), Q2 GDP, nonfarm payroll report (July), University of Michigan Sentiment (July final), ISM manufacturing (July) and June's core PCE price Index -- Fed's preferred gauge of inflation.

Gold Price Outlook:

As per Bloomberg, despite tariff concerns, nearly 82% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported their Q2 earnings so far have beaten profit forecasts, which makes Q2 to be on track for the best quarter in four years.

A weaker Indian Rupee offers some support to the domestic gold prices.

Downside may be limited ahead of the FOMC’s monetary policy decision due on July 30. Concerns over US-Russia relations may lend some support to the metal.

The Fed is expected to hold the overnight Fed Fund rate steady in the range of 4.25%-4.50%; however, investors look forward to clues on the future path of the policy, more so as the Fed Governor Waller has only recently supported the idea of beginning the rate cuts from July meeting itself.

The US Dollar is likely to trade with a slight positive bias in the runup to the FOMC decision as markets digest the near-term implications of the EU-US trade deal .

. Investors monitor US-China trade talks as well.

as well. Spot gold is expected to trade with a slight bearish tilt unless US-China trade tensions surface up once again.

Support is noted at $3292 Rs 97,700)/$3282 (Rs 97,400)/$3255 (Rs 96,600)/$3228 (Rs 95,800), while resistance comes in at $3343 (Rs 99,200)/$3375 (Rs 102,000).

Selling into rallies with a tight stop-loss is the preferred strategy for very short-term trading.

The US and China agreeing to extend their trade deal deadline may push the metal to $3255 in the short-term. Extension of the August 12 deadline is likely in the wake of the trade deals with Japan and the EU, though details of these deals are still awaited.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "".

This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97080546,imgsize-22694,width-400,resizemode-4/97080546.jpg"

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Trump’s trade vision takes shape: EU, Japan, Vietnam, others concede to tariff-heavy deals— but economic risks may dim the victory for US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-trade-vision-takes-shape-eu-others-concede-to-tariff-heavy-deals-but-economic-risks-may-dim-the-victory/articleshow/122965309.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

US President Donald Trump 's approach to global trade policy is yielding results with international partners. Nations including the European Union , Japan and Vietnam are accepting elevated tariffs for access to American markets. This strategy, rooted in Trump's protectionist views, represents a significant economic and political venture regarding American consumer interests.The United States and the European Union reached a trade agreement where the EU accepted 15% US tariffs on most goods. The EU also committed to purchasing $750 billion in US energy products and making $600 billion in new investments through 2028, according to White House figures.""We just signed a very big trade deal, the biggest of them all,"" Trump said Monday.The framework agreement's success remains uncertain, with minimal detail provided. Traditional trade agreements typically require extensive negotiations spanning months or years, with outcomes dependent on specific details.Financial markets have adapted to the highest US import tariffs in approximately 90 years, following initial concerns about protectionist policies.The US Treasury is receiving substantial revenue from foreign goods levies, potentially offsetting recent tax reductions signed on July 4.Economic experts suggest these high tariffs could increase consumer prices, affect Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, and reduce US economic efficiency. Democratic opponents argue these costs will primarily impact lower and middle-income Americans.""It's pretty striking that it's seen as a sigh of relief moment,"" said Daniel Hornung, a former Biden White House economic official who now holds fellowships at Housing Finance Policy Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as reported by AP. ""But if the new baseline across all trading partners is 15%, that is a meaningful drag on growth that increases recession risks, while simultaneously making it harder for the Fed to cut. ""Trump has long argued that America erred by not fully utilising its position as the world’s largest economy and imposing extensive tariffs, thereby compelling other nations to secure access to the U.S. consumer market.To his close aides, Trump’s implementation of tariffs has affirmed their confidence in his negotiating abilities and dismissed the warnings of economists who predicted economic downturns and inflation. The S&P 500 stock index remained largely unchanged on Monday, although equities have since recovered from the tariff-induced decline in April.“Where are the ‘experts’ now?” Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X.However, the situation remains unresolved. Many aspects of Trump’s trade agreements are still unclear and have not been formally documented. The US and Japan, for example, have provided differing accounts of Japan’s commitment to invest Rs 45.65 lakh crore in the United States.“The trade deals do seem to count as a qualified win for Trump, with other countries giving the US favourable trade terms while accepting US tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, as quoted by AP. “However, certain terms of the deals, such as other countries’ investments in the US, seem more promising in the abstract than they might prove in reality over time.""Trump is facing legal challenges from states and businesses contending that the president exceeded his authority by declaring national emergencies to justify tariffs on most global economies. In May, a federal court invalidated these tariffs. An appeals court, which has permitted the government to continue collecting the tariffs temporarily, is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Thursday.Additionally, Trump has yet to finalise an agreement with China, which has effectively employed retaliatory tariffs and the withholding of rare earth mineral exports—essential for electric vehicles, computer chips and wind turbines—to resist Trump’s demands. The U.S. and China are scheduled to engage in talks this week in Stockholm, Sweden.Additionally, there is doubt that the tariffs will generate the economic growth Trump has advocated.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said, “the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation,” but not a recession. After all, the 15% tariffs on the EU and Japan represent a modest increase from the 10% rate initiated by Trump in April during the negotiation phase.While automobiles produced in the EU and Japan will no longer be subject to the 25% tariffs Trump previously imposed, they will still incur a 15% tax that has not yet been reflected in prices at US dealerships. The administration has suggested that the absence of higher auto prices indicates that foreign manufacturers are absorbing the costs, but it may ultimately indicate the accumulation of auto inventories intended to preempt the import taxes.“Dealers built stocks ahead of tariff implementation, damping the immediate impact on retail prices. That cushion is starting to wear thin,” Morgan Stanley stated in a separate report. “Our Japan auto analyst notes that as pre-tariff inventory clears, replacement vehicles will likely carry higher price tags.”Mary Lovely, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, cautioned about a “slow-burn efficiency loss” as US companies struggle to adapt to Trump’s new policies. For decades, American firms have generally paid uniform tariffs – and often none at all – on imported machinery and raw materials globally.Now, due to Trump’s trade agreements, tariffs vary by country. “US firms have to change their designs and source inputs from different locations based on these variable tariff rates,” she said. “It’s an incredible administrative burden. These factors act as longer-term drags on the economy, but their effects will emerge only gradually.”","US President Donald Trump's approach to global trade policy is yielding results with international partners.
