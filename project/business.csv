"Arvind Kejriwal's reply flags ammonia, EC to insist on proof of 'poisoning'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwals-reply-flagsammonia-ec-to-insiston-proof-of-poisoning/articleshow/117713268.cms,"Poll What Should Be the Priority in Addressing Water Contamination Issues? Strengthening Water Treatment Infrastructure Ensuring Clean and Safe Drinking Water

Such toxic water poses grave health hazards: Ex-CM

NEW DELHI: Responding to the Election Commission’s notice seeking “evidence” to support his allegation that the BJP govt in Haryana was “poisoning” Delhi’s water supply in the run-up to the Feb 5 polls, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has said that the raw water received from the upper riparian state had been “highly contaminated and (is) extremely poisonous” for human health.This, he said, was also proved by a letter written by the DJB CEO to the chief secretary of the capital in which she had admitted that the level of ammonia in the Yamuna water was 6.5ppm while DJB water treatment plants were designed to treat up to 1pm.Late Wednesday night, EC sources said they were examining the reply but pointed out that it seems to have glossed over the central issue of substantiating the charge of “poisoning” of the water.Late Wednesday night, EC source said Kejriwal had fallen back on the complaint of increased ammonia levels which has already been raised by the Delhi and Punjab chief ministers and which EC is considering separately. The poll body has already asked Haryana govt for a report on the matter.An EC official said Kejriwal’s response did not contain any proof of “poisoning” of the river water by an elected state govt with the intention to kill the residents of Delhi, details of the poisoning agent, or how, when and which engineers at DJB had detected the poison and stopped the “poisoned” waters on the Delhi border. DJB had issued a denial of these claims, call them “false, misleading and factually incorrect”.EC’s letter asking Kejriwal to explain his “serious and unprecedented” charge against an elected govt had said, “…as regards the allegations of poisoning, it is expected that there must be a factual foundation to the allegations. Especially when the veracity of the statements made by you is contested, then you must be able to back your statements on a factual basis.” The reply had been sought following complaints from BJP and Congress.In his 14-page response to EC, the former Delhi chief minister has said that DJB’s CEO had identified indiscriminate discharge of industrial waste by Haryana as the root cause behind high toxicity in Yamuna water, and the state’s failure in controll ing pollution had resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis.He added that this issue had been raised earlier too and DJB had approached NGT and Supreme Court seeking relief. The consumption of such toxic water may lead to grave health hazards and fatality, Kejriwal said, adding that safe drinking water was a basic human right and raising the issue for society cannot be termed as an offence.He said the situation needed immediate institutional and govt intervention, and by no stretch of imagination could raising the issue be termed as “inciting enmity between different groups or prejudicial to national integration”.Referring to the high ammonia level in the Yamuna at the Wazirabad pond, from where the water treatment plants get supply of raw water, Kejriwal had on Monday accused Haryana of mixing “poison” in the river water and alleged that there was an “attempt of genocide” in the national capital.Kejriwal added that the ingestion of ammonia-contam inated water at elevated concentrations posed a severe and multifaceted health hazard and may lead to neurological impairment and encephalopathy, liver and kidney dysfunction, infant mortality risk and bacterial outbreaks.“Any failure to mitigate this contamination places millions of lives at immediate risk and constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to health under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” he said.Referring to various judgments delivered by SC, Kejriwal argued in his letter that his statements did not attract Sections 196 (promoting enmity between different groups), 197 (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 353 (statements conducing to public mischief) of BNS Act; Section 123(4) (corrupt practices-publication of false statements) of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951; and the model code of conduct.Instead, he said, his statements were “fully protected” under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and expression. “As per the law laid down by Supreme Court in similar matters, the effect of the said statement has to be seen and judged from the standard of reasonable and strongminded men and not weak vacillating minds,” he said. “Terming it as an offence has grave consequences for democracy and polity in India and causes a chilling effect on the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression…” he added.He said the chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab will write a letter to EC seeking an urgent meeting and intervention.“Any attempt to suppress discourse on such an alarming public health crisis is not only antithetical to democratic principles but also constitutes a direct affront to the citizens’ right to demand remedial action from the state,” he added.Kejriwal said his statement neither referred to, nor imputed anything against the personal character or conduct of any candidate contesting the elections and urged EC to close the issue.",Arvind Kejriwal says raw water received from upper riparian state had been “highly contaminated and (is) extremely poisonous” for human health. Kejriwal says DJB CEO admitted that the level of ammonia in the Yamuna water was 6.5ppm while DJB water treatment plants were designed to treat up to 1pm.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117714040,imgsize-18108,width-400,resizemode-4/117714040.jpg"

"Mumbai Airport Terminal 1 to shut this year, 10 million flyers to shift to Navi Mumbai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-airports-terminal-1-to-shut-this-year-10-million-flyers-to-shift-to-navi-mumbai/articleshow/117631636.cms,"Poll What’s the Most Annoying Part of Traveling Through Airports? Delayed or Canceled Flights Long Lines at Security

MUMBAI: Passengers will face a clear choice when the Navi Mumbai airport begins operations in late May: should they select the new airport or continue using the one in Mumbai? However, within a decade, this choice will become less pronounced as the Navi Mumbai airport takes the lead. According to projections, by the early 2030s, it should handle most flights in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), becoming its primary airport, with the Mumbai airport assuming a secondary role.This winter, though, only about one-fifth of the 55 million passengers currently handled by the Mumbai airport will head to the Navi Mumbai airport. Of the 15 million passengers handled by Mumbai’s Terminal 1 (T1) at Santacruz (East), flights carrying 10 million passengers are likely to shift to T1 of NMIA by the end of October, while the remaining 5 million will be accommodated at Mumbai’s Terminal 2 (T2) in Sahar, said an NMIA official. To accommodate this shift, the capacity of Mumbai T2 will be increased from 40 million to 45 million passengers, the source added.Currently, all flights—domestic and international—land on the single operational runway at Mumbai airport, after which passengers are transported to their respective terminals, T2 or T1. Most general aviation flights, including private and charter aircraft, will also transition to the Navi Mumbai airport in the coming months. This winter, air traffic congestion at the Mumbai airport is expected to ease, improving its punctuality record. As a result, the holding time for flights waiting to land at Mumbai airport or the waiting time to begin pushback for departures is likely to decrease, improving on-time performance.In the long term, the busy and congested Mumbai airport will take the number two position as MMR’s secondary airport. The world’s great cities are usually served by multiple airports, with one being the main airport and the others serving as secondary airports. For example, in London, Heathrow is the busiest airport, while Gatwick, Stansted, and Luton serve as secondary airports. Similarly, New York’s main airport is John F. Kennedy, with Newark Liberty and LaGuardia functioning as secondary airports.The current Mumbai airport handled 55 million passengers in 2024. It will remain Mumbai’s Heathrow this decade, during which the new Navi Mumbai airport at Ulwe will serve as the metropolis’s Gatwick, expected to handle around 10 million passengers this year and 20 million by mid-2026.The Navi Mumbai T1 has a declared passenger handling capacity of 20 million ppa, or about 55,000 per day. It is expected to reach saturation point by mid-2026—probably the shortest saturation time in the world for a greenfield airport terminal. Navi Mumbai T2, with a declared capacity of 30 million ppa, will be ready by 2029. “Between 2026 and 2029, Mumbai T2 and Navi Mumbai T1 terminal buildings will be expanded to exceed their declared capacity in order to handle the passenger traffic growth,” the official added.The new airport will continue expanding, adding terminal buildings and increasing capacity. It will continue to resemble a construction site for years, as work progresses across its 2,860 acres over the next decade.The congested Mumbai airport will struggle to keep pace with the growth of the Navi Mumbai airport, and by 2030, both airports will handle over 50-55 million PPA each, competing closely. But as the Navi Mumbai airport continues to expand, a role reversal will occur by 2032: it will take on the mantle of the region’s main airport—its Heathrow—complete with parallel runways. In 2032, the Navi Mumbai airport will have its Terminal 3, with a capacity of 20 million PPA, and later Terminal 4 in 2036, also with a 20-million PPA capacity. This will take Navi Mumbai airport’s capacity to 90 million PPA, a number that the congested Mumbai airport cannot match. Mumbai airport, much like Gatwick in London with its single runway, will become the region’s secondary airport.BVJK Sharma, CEO of Navi Mumbai International Airport, said: “The Navi Mumbai airport is well supported by multimodal connectivity, and we are confident in meeting MMR’s ever-increasing demand. I am positive that the airport will contribute greatly to the region’s and country’s growth.”The final stage of this competition between the two airports will mark a major decline for Mumbai airport, which was India’s busiest until 2010. Hemmed in by slums and without the possibility of land acquisition, the Mumbai airport hasn’t been able to expand. With infrastructure constraints stifling its growth, Delhi airport has surpassed it to claim the top spot among the country’s airports, a rank that the National Capital Region will continue to occupy.The Navi Mumbai airport will not restore the Mumbai Metropolitan Region's position as the leader in this category, as Delhi airport, along with the new Jewar airport—which is also set to open this year—will have a higher passenger-handling capacity than Mumbai and Navi Mumbai combined.","The new Navi Mumbai airport begins operations in late May.

The area denial munitions have the capability to saturate a target area with multiple bomblets, including anti-tank and anti-personnel minelets.The two types of ammunition will be produced by the Nagpur-based private sector Solar Group and state-owned Munitions India Ltd in a 60:40 ratio, with the contracts now set to be inked with them within the next few days, sources told TOI.The Army currently has four Pinaka regiments, with some of the launchers also deployed in high-altitude areas along the northern borders with China, while the other six are in the process of being inducted.DRDO has developed a variety of ammunition for the Pinaka, including rockets with 45-km extended range and 75-km guided extended range. The plan now underway is to further enhance the range first to 120-km and then to 300-km.“As soon as we get longer ranges, we might drop plans for other alternate long-range weapons we are looking at and concentrate on it (Pinaka),” Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had stated earlier this month.","PM-led cabinet committee on security cleared two major deals worth around Rs 10,200 crore for its lethal ammunition.

How many triple talaq FIRs filed on Muslim men: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-many-triple-talaq-firs-filed-on-muslim-men-sc/articleshow/117710188.cms,"NEW DELHI: Terming the practice of instant divorce through triple talaq as indefensible after a five-judge bench in 2017 declared it unconstitutional, Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would examine the validity of the post-judgment legislation providing for up to three-year jail term for Muslim men persisting with the practice of abruptly ending their marriages by uttering the dreaded T-word thrice.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""If the practice of triple talaq is banned, no Muslim man can divorce his wife through this process. So, even if the marriage survives, the man would be liable for a jail term under Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, merely for uttering triple talaq.""To know the ground situation, the bench asked the Centre to furnish data on registration of FIRs against Muslim men across India for attempting to divorce their wives through triple talaq despite it being declared unconstitutional by SC in 2017 and criminalised by law in 2019.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said ""the statistics would give the real picture of the situation in rural areas"" and justified the need to criminalise the practice, adding that SC declaring talaq-e-bidat, or triple talaq, as unconstitutional did not deter Muslim men from continuing with the practice. He said unlike most laws enacted to protect women from abuse, harassment and discrimination that provide for a minimum punishment of three years, the 2019 law has set the maximum punishment at three years, while leaving it to the discretion of the court to decide the quantum of imprisonment and fine.Many Muslim organisations have questioned the validity of the 2019 legislation on the ground that once a practice was banned, there was no question of any Muslim man obtaining a legally valid divorce through this method. Senior advocate M R Shamshad and counsel Nizamuddin Pasha said mere utterance of triple talaq could not be criminalised and made liable to prison term. This threat of imprisonment for similar utterances by men professing other religions was not there, hence the 2019 law was discriminatory, they argued.CJI Khanna said for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians, marriage laws are codified and provide a procedure for divorce with no provision for instant divorce. ""Let the Centre file the requisite data. We will examine it,"" the bench said and posted the matter for the last week of March.Mehta said govt, by enacting the law, intended to stop exploitation of Muslim women who had the threat of triple talaq hanging over their heads. Referring to the 2017 five-judge bench judgment on the lead petition by 35-year-old Shayara Bano, who had challenged the regressive practice that ended her 15-year marriage in an instant, SG quoted a famous couplet, ""Talaq toh dete ho itab-o-kahar ke saath, mera shabab bhi lauta do meri mehr ke saath (you are giving me talaq with anger, but as you return my mehr money, also return my youth).""The Centre in its affidavit had countered the petitioners' argument that marriage being governed by personal law must be exempted from the ambit of criminal law. The Centre's affidavit said, ""Marriages are a social institution which the state has a special interest in protecting. It is beyond doubt that the state can protect the stability of marriages by resorting to the device of criminal law."" It cited enactment of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, and Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.Shamshad argued that police took months to register FIRs under DV Act despite allegations of physical assault by husbands, yet they registered FIRs instantaneously under the 2019 law and sent Muslim men to jail.",Supreme Court to examine validity of post-judgment legislation providing for up to three-year jail term for Muslim men persisting with the practice of abruptly ending their marriages by uttering the dreaded T-word thrice.

30 die in stampede at Kumbh on morning of auspicious dip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/30-die-in-stampede-at-kumbh-on-morning-of-auspicious-dip/articleshow/117706943.cms,"Cops Deny VIP Protocols Led To Slackness In Crowd Control



PRAYAGRAJ: At least 30 pilgrims died and over 60 were injured in a stampede on Akhara Marg early Wednesday after a rush of visitors converging on Sangam for a dip in the opening hours of Maha Kumbh's 'mauni amavasya' - the most auspicious period in the 45-day event's calendar - led to barricades collapsing and opened the gateway to chaos for close to an hour.The 1-2am tragedy capped a crowd management nightmare, marked by over 12 crore pilgrims swamping the Maha Kumbh area over the past two days leading to mauni amavasya. Nearly 5.5 crore had taken a dip in the waters of the Sangam by late Tuesday, according to official data. As the night wore on, the congregation only grew.Witnesses said some pilgrims started climbing over the barricades on Akhara Marg in their eagerness to reach the Sangam nose, causing these to collapse. The stream of people behind them approaching the Sangam Ram Ghat immediately rushed forward, trampling pilgrims sitting or lying on the ground on the other side of where the barricades stood in anticipation of ""Brahma muhurt"" (break of dawn).As ambulance sirens rent the night air, security personnel and rescue workers were seen carrying many of the injured on stretchers to waiting vehicles. Blankets, bags and footwear lay strewn across the stampede site.A 50-year-old woman from MP's Chhatarpur district was among those killed. Her daughter, 20, was critically injured. Hukum Bai Lodhi was in a group of 14 from Sunwaha village that had travelled 400km to Prayagraj.Sarpanch Chatur Singh, who led the pilgrims from Sunwaha, said it took workers nearly two hours to find Hukum Bai's body as the crowd kept surging. Her daughter Deepa was rescued and taken to a local hospital.Four of the dead were pilgrims from Karnataka's Belagavi. An injured woman, Sarojini, said she and the rest of the group were awaiting their turn to take a dip in Sangam when an avalanche of feet drove everyone to the ground. ""I don't know how I survived in the darkness,"" she said.Official sources said the authorities chose to withhold the official casualty figure until Wednesday evening to avert panic among the crowd of devotees already in the mela area.CM Yogi Adityanath, who arrived at the site within an hour and monitored the situation through the night, turned emotional while revealing that 30 people had died.He declared ex gratia of Rs 25 lakh each to the families of the deceased and instituted a judicial probe by a three-member committee led by former HC judge Harsh Kumar. Retired IPS officer V K Gupta and ex-IAS officer B K Singh are the other members. Police will conduct a separate probe.""What happened here is heart-wrenching, and a lesson. There is a need to go into the details of how it happened despite all the arrangements in place,"" Adityanath said. ""PM Narendra Modi called four times to inquire about the rescue effort. I urge pilgrims not to pay heed to rumours.""Akhara Parishad chief Ravindra Puri initially announced that the second Amrit Snan had been cancelled. At the CM's intervention, all 13 akharas went for Amrit Snan around 2.30pm instead of the scheduled 5am start.""I spoke to the Akhara Parishad heads and other seers, including Maha Mandaleshwars. They politely agreed to let devotees take a dip first,"" Adityanath said.Undeterred by the stampede, more than 7.6 crore people took the dip at Sangam during the Mauni Amavasya Amrit Snan by 8.30 pm on Wednesday. With this, nearly 27.6 crore devotees went for 'snan' in just 16 days during the ongoing Maha Kumbh, surpassing the previous record of 24 crore pilgrims in 2019 Kumbh.As per the data released by mela authorities, devotees took the dip at different temporary ghats built on the banks of the Ganga over a stretch of 12km. Nearly 2.8 crore devotees had taken the dip by 8am. The number swelled to over 5 crore by 2pm.Vehicles were stopped far away from the city to keep the situation under control and devotees were sent to ghats via a longer route. But the pilgrims were undeterred by the news of the stampede and route diversions put in place by the administration following the tragedy. They walked long distances for the dip.All roads leading to the mela area witnessed a heavy inflow of devotees, so much so that the entire stretch of a road was not visible at several points. Since early hours of Wednesday, a sea of devotees continued to move towards the mela area. All the roads in areas such as Civil Lines, Katra Shivkuti, Kydganj, Mutthiganj and Bahadurganj remained choked with devouts.DIG Vaibhav Krishna said rescue workers moved the injured pilgrims to various hospitals, of whom 30 died. At least 25 of the dead, including one each from Assam and Gujarat, have been identified.""A helpline (1920) has been set up to coordinate relief efforts, and hospitals have been reinforced with additional medical personnel to handle the crisis,"" Krishna said.On whether VIP protocols led to slackness in crowd management, the DIG said, ""No VIP vehicle was allowed entry to ensure an unrestricted pilgrimage experience for the general public.""Mela officer Vijay Kiran Anand confirmed this policy would continue for the upcoming Amrit Snan on Basant Panchami.Over 27 crore people have visited Maha Kumbh since it started on Jan 13, as per official estimates. The footfall surpassed the 2019 record of 24 crore in 15 days.","At least 30 pilgrims died and over 60 were injured in a stampede on Akhara Marg early Wednesday.

Trump admin set to push India to ink more defence deals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-admin-set-to-push-india-to-ink-more-defence-deals/articleshow/117703867.cms,"NEW DELHI: From fighter jets and armoured combat vehicles to aero-engines and missiles, Trump administration is set to push India to further crank up military purchase from US, which already stands at well over $25 billion just since 2007.President Donald Trump’s transactional approach was clearly evident in his phone conversation with PM Narendra Modi on Monday, where he called upon India to increase its procurement of US-origin weapon systems and platforms.“India will have to negotiate carefully with the new Trump administration. US military technology is certainly top-notch, but it will have to dovetail into our policy of ‘Make in India’ with foreign collaboration at a reasonable cost. India wants codevelopment and co-production instead of just outright purchases,” an official said.Trump’s push comes barely four months after India inked a mega $3.3 billion contract with US govt for 31 weaponized MQ-9B ‘Predator’ remotely piloted aircraft, along with another $520 million contract with drone-manufacturer General Atomics to set up an MRO facility here.But that was during the last days of the Biden administration. Trump will want his own pound of flesh in terms of big deals, apart of course from strategic convergence on several fronts. There are, of course, the ongoing techno-commercial negotiations, which began last month, for co-production of the American General Electric F414-INS6 aeroengines with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India for Tejas Mark-II fighters. The deal, which involves 80% transfer of technology of engine parts of the total value, will cost around $1.5 billion.US has also been hard-selling joint manufacture of the latest generation of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) as part of the bilateral defence-industrial cooperation roadmap, which was finalised in June 2023.With the Army projecting a requirement for 527 wheeled ICVs as part of its much bigger plan for mechanized infantry units, US quietly demonstrated the mobility and firepower of the eight-wheeled Stryker, with the Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, in high-altitude Ladakh in Sept, amid some criticism of indigenous options being ignored in the process.The US is also eyeing IAF’s long-standing quest for 114 new multi-role fighter aircraft to be manufactured in India, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration. With the defence ministry now working to break the logjam over the project, US will be showcasing its F-16 and fifth-generation F-35 fighters at Aero-India in Bengaluru from Feb 10 to 14. US would like India to also buy another six P-8I longrange maritime patrol aircraft to add to the 12 similar planes packed with weapons and sensors it has acquired for $3.2 billion earlier.","President Donald Trump’s transactional approach was clearly evident in his phone conversation with PM Narendra Modi on Monday.

"Mixed schoolbag: Attendance up, but digi-learning uneven",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mixed-schoolbag-attendance-up-but-digi-learning-uneven/articleshow/117711222.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's education landscape in 2024 showed mixed progress in key areas such as school attendance, digital literacy, and the reduction in underage enrolment, according to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024. While overall school attendance had improved marginally, digital literacy among students remains uneven, and there was a noteworthy decline in the proportion of underage children enrolling in govt schools.Student attendance in govt schools had steadily increased since 2018. Nationally, attendance in govt primary schools rose from 72.4% in 2018 to 75.9% in 2024. However, ASER data revealed stark state-wise disparities. Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh recorded attendance levels above 85%, whereas states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar lagged with figures around 65%. UP played a crucial role in driving the national increase in attendance, according to the ASER survey.Digital literacy emerged as a crucial area of focus, yet the findings indicate wide variations across states. Nationally, about 70.2% of boys and 62.2% of girls aged 14-16 could access a smartphone for digital tasks. The survey assessed children on basic digital skills such as setting an alarm, browsing for information, and locating a video on YouTube. Over 75% of those tested were able to complete the tasks successfully.Gender disparities were evident, with boys outperforming girls in most states except Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, where the gap was either negligible or reversed. Access to smartphones was nearly universal, with 90% of students reporting availability at home, but ownership was significantly lower, particularly among girls. In Bihar, Jharkhand & MP, both access and usage of smartphones were below national average. ""Many students have smartphones at home but lack digital skills,"" stated an ASER field coordinator.The report highlights both progress and persistent challenges in India's education sector. While improvements in attendance and digital literacy are encouraging, gender gaps and regional inequalities remain concerns. The decline in underage enrolment marks a significant structural shift, likely to have positive long-term impacts on learning outcomes. As India continues to expand access to education, bridging these gaps will be critical to ensuring equitable and quality learning opportunities for all children.","School attendance in govt primary schools rose from 72.4% in 2018 to 75.9% in 2024. Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh recorded attendance levels above 85%. states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar lagged with figures around 65%. UP played a crucial role in driving the national increase in attendance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117711441,imgsize-39608,width-400,resizemode-4/117711441.jpg"
SC: Can't disqualify anyone from outside state for PG medical seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cant-disqualify-anyone-from-outside-state-for-pg-medical-seats/articleshow/117709078.cms,"SC: We all are domiciled in the territory of India

NEW DELHI: Observing that there is no concept of state domicile in the Constitution, which only recognises domicile of India, Supreme Court on Wednesday said domicile-based reservation in specialised and higher studies like postgraduate (PG) medical courses is not permissible and quota for residents of states could be extended to a certain degree in undergraduate (UG) courses like MBBS.Differentiating between MBBS and higher studies, a bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia and SVN Bhatti said quota for UG courses was justified as the state spends money on creating infra and bears expenses on running a medical college.Supreme Court said quota for UG courses was justified as the state spends money on creating infra. Therefore, some reservation at the basic level of a medical course, i.e. MBBS, can be permissible for the residents, it said.""We are all domiciled in the territory of India. We are all residents of India. Our common bond as citizens and residents of one country gives us right not only to choose our residence anywhere in India, but also gives us right to carry on trade and business or a profession anywhere in India. It also gives us the right to seek admission in educational institutions across India,"" the bench said.""The benefit of reservation in educational institutions, including medical colleges, to those who reside in a particular state can be given to a certain degree only in MBBS courses. But considering the importance of specialists doctors, reservation at the higher level on the basis of residence would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,"" it added.Justice Dhulia, who penned the verdict for the bench, said if such reservation was permitted in PG courses, it would be an invasion on the fundamental rights of several students, who would be treated unequally simply for the reason that they belonged to a different state in the Union, and this would be a violation of the equality clause in Article 14. He said each citizen of the country carried with him or her one single domicile, which was the ""domicile of India"", and the concept of regional or provincial domicile was alien to the Indian legal system.The court said the classification between residents and others for MBBS courses could be justified as it sought to maintain a balance of local needs, backwardness of the area, the expense borne by the state in creating the infrastructure etc. The bench agreed with the submission of senior advocate Nidhesh Gupta, appearing for a batch of aggrieved students, that reservation in admissions to PG medical courses within the state quota was constitutionally invalid and impermissible. In this case, the students were challenging 32 seats earmarked for Chandigarh residents in Govt Medical College and Hospital.The bench referred to SC's earlier verdict, including one by a constitution bench, and said all admissions to PG courses in any institution should be open to candidates on an all-India basis and there should be no restriction regarding domicile in the state/UT in which the institution was located.","Supreme Court said quota for UG courses was justified as the state spends money on creating infra.

However, state-wise disparities remain stark, underscoring the uneven impact of interventions.The report, covering nearly 6.5 lakh children across 17,997 villages, revealed that in reading proficiency, the national average for children in standard III who can read a standard II level text has risen to 23.4%, the highest recorded in over a decade, up from 16.3% in 2022. The proportion of standard V students achieving this benchmark has also increased to 44.8% from 38.5% in 2022, surpassing the pre-pandemic 2018 level of 44.2%. Among states, Mizoram (64.9%) and Himachal Pradesh (64.8%) recorded the highest reading proficiency for standard V students in govt schools.UP emerged as the most improved state, where standard III reading levels rose from 16.4% in 2022 to 27.9% in 2024, marking a 69% increase in two years. Other notable gainers include Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Haryana, and Maharashtra. In contrast, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana saw declines in reading levels, particularly in standard VIII.Arithmetic skills have also improved, with 33.7% of standard III students demonstrating subtraction proficiency, up from 25.9% in 2022 and 28.2% in 2018. Among standard V students, 30.7% could solve a division problem, marking an increase from 25.6% in 2022.The strongest arithmetic gains were observed in Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Punjab. Uttar Pradesh recorded its highest arithmetic learning levels in 20 years, further strengthening its recovery trajectory. Private schools, however, showed weaker improvements compared to govt schools, highlighting the effectiveness of public sector interventions such as National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat.Despite these improvements, the lowest-performing states in reading for standard V include Bihar (14.8%), Madhya Pradesh (16.0%), Rajasthan (17.5%), Telangana (20.3%), and Punjab (14.0%). In arithmetic, Bihar (8.1%), Madhya Pradesh (14.4%), Rajasthan (14.3%), Telangana (8.2%), and Punjab (13.4%) lag significantly behind the national average.The impact of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and NIPUN Bharat initiative is evident in the upward trend in FLN outcomes. ASER 2024 notes that 83% of govt schools received formal FLN implementation directives, 78% had at least one trained FLN teacher, and 75% had access to FLN-specific teaching-learning materials. These efforts have contributed to improvements, particularly in govt schools, which have outperformed private institutions in learning recovery post-pandemic.However, challenges persist. While FLN-focused policies are translating into better learning outcomes, classroom pedagogy still requires further alignment with foundational skill-building.

It has also endorsed the govt's move to include non-Muslims in waqf boards.As per the bill, waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community. Also, Muslim trusts that function similarly to waqf but are governed by trust laws will be excluded from Waqf Act, 1995, preventing legal conflicts. The finality of tribunal decisions has been removed. Any aggrieved person can now appeal to HC within 90 days of the tribunal's decision.In his dissent note, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said last-minute inclusion of the proviso to the clause omitting 'waqf by user' was ""wholly unhelpful"" as the principle will only be tested in cases where the property is placed ""in dispute"", in which case proviso will not apply.Congress member Gaurav Gogoi in his dissent note expressed fear over possibility of bad-faith actors instituting litigation over any part of the properties belonging to 'waqf by user' and preventing it from seeking any protection under the amended Act.TMC members Kalyan Banerjee and Nadimul Haque objected to the amendment to the original Act that states if any govt property is identified or declared as waqf property, before or after the enforcement of this Act, it shall not be a waqf property.",The Joint Parliamentary Committee examining the Waqf (Amendment) Bill on Wednesday adopted its report by a 15-11 majority vote.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Nuclear weapons development: One of the primary concerns surrounding this facility is its potential application in nuclear weapons design. The technology employed in laser-ignited fusion can enhance a country's capability to develop and refine nuclear weapons without conducting actual tests. William Alberque, a nuclear policy analyst, noted, ""Any country with an NIF-type facility can and probably will be increasing their confidence and improving existing weapons designs"" without the need for testing. This capability could allow China to advance its nuclear arsenal while adhering to international testing bans.

This capability could allow China to advance its nuclear arsenal while adhering to international testing bans. Energy production research: In addition to military applications, the facility may also contribute to advancements in clean energy production. Fusion energy is viewed as a ""holy grail"" due to its potential to provide an almost limitless source of power with minimal environmental impact. If successful, this research could position China as a leader in global energy innovation, potentially altering energy dynamics worldwide.

China's nuclear capabilities

China is constructing a large-scale laser-ignited nuclear fusion research facility in the southwestern city of Mianyang, which experts said Bejing will utilise to enhance both nuclear weapons design capabilities and research into advanced power generation methods.Satellite imagery has unveiled a sprawling complex, featuring four external arms, each housing laser bays, and a central experimental chamber designed to contain hydrogen isotopes. These isotopes, such as deuterium and tritium, will be subjected to intense laser beams, facilitating fusion reactions that generate energy.The design of the facility closely mirrors that of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California, which successfully achieved ""scientific breakeven"" in 2022 by producing more energy from fusion than was consumed by the lasers.Experts estimate that the experimental chamber at the Mianyang facility is approximately 50% larger than its counterpart at NIF, which is currently the largest facility of its kind globally.The development of the project, suggests China is preparing for extensive experiments that could bolster its nuclear arsenal without necessitating traditional nuclear tests.The revelation of the new bleeding edge facility has raised significant questions regarding its potential applications and implications for regional security, particularly for India.China's nuclear capabilities have been rapidly increasing, with its arsenal growing from 410 nuclear warheads in January 2023 to an estimated 500 by January 2024. This expansion is part of a broader strategy to enhance its nuclear deterrent capabilities, and projections suggest that if this trend continues, China could potentially match the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) possessed by the US or Russia by the end of the decade.The new facility will help Beijing refine nuclear weapons designs without necessitating actual tests, thereby allowing China to bolster its arsenal covertly while adhering to international non-proliferation norms.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) noted that this growth positions China as a formidable nuclear power, significantly outpacing India's capabilities.India's nuclear arsenal is estimated to consist of 172 warheads, slightly more than Pakistan's 170.While India has made strides in modernising its nuclear delivery systems — such as the Agni series of ballistic missiles — its overall stockpile remains limited compared to China's rapid expansion.Besides nuclear weapons, China also outpaces India in nuclear power generation.India operates 23 nuclear power reactors, generating approximately 6 per cent of its total electricity.China, on the other hand, has 55 operational reactors and is rapidly expanding its nuclear energy capacity as part of its broader strategy to transition towards cleaner energy sources.China is also the first country globally to commercialise third-generation reactors. China's ongoing nuclear expansion includes plans to build between six to eight new reactors annually, alongside the operation of advanced reactors like the Shidaowan-1, which is a fourth-generation gas-cooled reactor.Experts anticipate that the construction of a new nuclear facility in China will significantly enhance Beijing's capabilities in both nuclear weapons development and power generation. This advancement is expected to further widen the already substantial gap between China's nuclear capabilities and those of India.","China is constructing a large-scale laser-ignited nuclear fusion research facility in the southwestern city of Mianyang.

Deferred resignation: What is it?



Elon Musk clarifies what federal employees can do for 8 months



The Donald Trump administration sent a mail to federal employees offering them payouts for eight months if they choose to resign. The federal employees now have time till February 6 to respond to the mail and get full pay through the end of September, or they risk being furloughed or being made easier to fire. Elon Musk praised the offer several times on his social media platform X triggering speculation whether he drafted the mail as it bore a strong resemblance to what Musk did at then-Twitter in 2022. In fact, Musk's email also had ""Fork in the Road"" subject line.""Worth noting that the 8 month severance offer through the end of the government fiscal year is the most that is legally allowed without Congress passing another appropriations bill. Very generous,"" Musk posted on X.""It really is a fair & generous deal,"" Elon Musk wrote again commenting on a post that equated the buyout offer to a paid vacation.The memo sent to government employees Tuesday evening informed them of their offer for ""deferred resignation,"" which would begin effective immediately and offer pay and benefits until Sept. 30, for those who accept. Any government employee can qualify through Feb. 6, ""except for military personnel of the armed forces, employees of the U.S. Postal Service, those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security, and those in any other positions specifically excluded by your employing agency,"" the memo said.A follow-up memo from the government said employees who accept the resignation offer would ""promptly"" have their duties reassigned or eliminated, and be placed on administrative leave.The 'deferred resignation' is a brainchild of Elon Musk'd DOGE as he continued to explain the program as confusion persisted. In the latest post, Musk explained that the federal employees, unless in rare cases, are not expected to work during the deferred resignation period. The federal employees can take a vacation, watch movies and chill and can even do any other job.There are two million federal workers to whom this offer has been made. About 5-10 per cent of the workforce is estimated to quit which could lead to around $100 billion in savings.","The Donald Trump administration sent a mail to federal employees offering them payouts for eight months if they choose to resign.

Ever wonder if a college degree is the secret to billions? The world's richest people broke not only the bank but also quite some interesting educational paths. Here are the educational journeys of elite Ivy League dropouts and people who followed rather odd routes to great wealth.Did Jeff Bezos dream of e-commerce while studying engineering? What did Elon Musk learn before targeting Mars? Does Bill Gates regret leaving Harvard? Their answers might shock you! Whether they earned fancy diplomas or dropped class to join startups, these 10 billionaires show that the road to riches is as varied as it is inspiring. So get ready to dive into their educational stories.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, attended Queen's University in Canada but would later move to the United States to attend the University of Pennsylvania to pursue degrees in business and physics. His desire was thus fulfilled where he could be more entrepreneurial and up-to-date with the world of technology. His quest for deeper knowledge led him to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, after being at Stanford for only two days, he decided to pursue his entrepreneurial pursuits and left college. Although Musk never completed that program, this educational background largely molded his revolutionary ideas in matters related to technology and business.Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, graduated from Princeton University, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. His time at Princeton was pivotal in shaping his future, as the knowledge he gained in these fields laid the groundwork for his innovative work in technology and e-commerce. With a strong foundation in both engineering and computer science, Bezos combined technical expertise with a visionary mindset to revolutionize the retail industry. He founded Amazon, which is today the global powerhouse it is.Larry Ellison initially started as a pre-med student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign but later left before completion of his studies. He thereafter enrolled in the University of Chicago where he majored in physics and mathematics. But he did not graduate. Even though he dropped out from both high school and the University of Illinois early in his academic life, Ellison had become passionate about technology and innovation, which led to co-founding Oracle as it revolutionized the soft-ware industry. It is an enlightening reminder of how educational pathways are not the definitive route to success; rather, passion sometimes leads to incredible feats.Mark Zuckerberg first went to Harvard University to study psychology and computer science. Yet, after only two years, he quit college and took up the entrepreneurial career to pursue his goals. Focusing on Facebook was much more important to him than any college where he might have spent most of his time developing the social media platform that would change the course of connectivity among online users. Although he did not graduate from Harvard, dropping out marked the beginning of an incredible journey that made him one of the most influential figures in the tech world and one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.Bernard Arnault is the man behind the LVMH empire, which comprises brands such as Louis Vuitton and cosmetics giant Sephora. He graduated from École Polytechnique in Paris with a Bachelor of Arts and Science. This institution formed the basis for Arnault's incredible journey into the world of high-end fashion and cosmetics. His education was well-equipped with the analytical skills and business acumen that would later help him build one of the most influential luxury conglomerates in the world. Arnault's success story shows how a strong academic background can blend with entrepreneurial vision to create global dominance.Larry Page, the co-founder of Google, graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan. While studying at Michigan, he established a strong background in computer science that eventually made him interested in search engine technology. Page later continued his studies for a PhD in computer science at Stanford University, where he met Sergey Brin. Together, they worked on a research project that eventually became Google. Page left his PhD program to focus on developing Google, but his academic background played a crucial role in shaping the innovative approach that led to the creation of one of the world's most successful tech companies.Sergey Brin graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, College Park, with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. He later acquired his Master's degree in computer science from Stanford University. At this time, he was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, an award that recognizes potential to grow into new talent in technology. This is where Larry Page came into his life, and he and Page started on a journeythat transformed the tech industry itself, making him the man behind Google, the world's leading search engine.Warren Buffett studied business at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Economics in 1950. After that, he studied economics at Columbia Business School, earning a Master of Science in Economics in 1951. At Columbia, he was under the mentorship of Benjamin Graham, one of the most important economists and investors, whose value investing principles Buffett used to great effect in his investment strategies.Steve Ballmer graduated from Harvard University in 1977, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics. He later attended Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating with an MBA in 1980. His academic exposure to applied mathematics, economics, and business paved the way for his professional life at Microsoft. After joining the company in 1980, he became very close to Bill Gates, eventually taking on the position of CEO from 2000-2014 and steering the company through growth that turned it into one of the world's most valuable tech companies.The founder and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, has impressive academic credentials. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University. He further went on to obtain his Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Huang's education in electrical engineering laid a foundation for his future career in technology and semiconductor industries.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Ever since the last Union Budget was presented in July 2024, the world has seen significant changes ranging from various elections, global economic slowdown, geopolitical developments, volatile Indian stock markets, etc. Having witnessed all of this, the common man awaits with eager anticipation from the Hon'ble Finance Minister as she gears up to unveil her eighth straight budget. Some of the key expectations that individual taxpayers may have are discussed below.It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals to either spend or save, thereby boosting the overall economy.The full rebate of tax is available up to income limit of Rs 7 lakh currently under the new tax regime. It is expected that this limit can be raised to Rs 10 lakh, offering relief to middle income taxpayers and making it easier for them to manage their finances.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Top tax reliefs FM Sitharaman should consider in Union Budget To protect salaried taxpayers, there is a case in point to increase the standard deduction under the new regime from the current Rs 75,000 to Rs 1,00,000. This increase will help combat inflation and address the higher personal expenses incurred due to changes in work culture, such as working from home, hybrid work, and work from anywhere.n line with the Government's objective of ""Housing for All"" and fostering home ownership, it is suggested that the Government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans under the new default tax regime.To reduce the carbon footprint and move towards clean energy, the Government should reintroduce the deduction provided under section 80EEB (deduction for interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle) and extend it to the new regime as well.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Individual taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to lower tax rates, make new tax regime more attractive, says survey Currently, if a property seller is a resident, buyers must deduct tax at 1% of the consideration if the property value is Rs 50 lakh or more and file a challan-cum-statement, which is a simple and convenient process. However, if the seller is a non-resident, the buyer must obtain a TAN for this one-off transaction, deduct tax at a higher rate, and file a TDS return, which is a cumbersome process. The government should consider introducing challan-cum-statement for non-resident sellers akin to resident sellers to simplify the process.The proposed measures pave the way for significantly improving financial well-being and stimulate economic growth.","It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime.

Sharks divided after the pitch

Anupam Mittal , People Group founder and one of the sharks on Shark Tank India , is once again in the spotlight for his no-holds-barred criticism. This time, his sharp remarks were directed at a social media influencer who pitched a business idea during the show. Vijay Nihalchandani, a business and finance influencer who presented his startup Make My Payment, faced a blunt reality check when Mittal dismissed the idea with the comment, ""Isse acha thela laga lo"" (Better to start a street cart than this).This comes days after Gaurav Taneja, the popular YouTuber and fitness influencer shared his reflections on his experience at the show. “Shut down YouTube and go all in on one business. That’s the advice I got from some Sharks on Shark Tank India,” he revealed in a LinkedIn post. He further revealed that during the pitch, one of the sharks questioned him whether he will continue making videos for YouTube. To which he replied with a confident ‘Yes’.Make My Payment is an app designed to send automated payment reminders to defaulting debtors. Nihalchandani came to the show along with his wife, brother and business partner. The founders pitched their idea on Shark Tank India, seeking Rs 30 lakh in exchange for a 3% equity stake in their company.When asked about the number of users on their platform, Vijay’s wife revealed that out of 3,500 sign-ups, only 200 were paying subscribers. Reacting to this, Anupam Mittal pointed out the weak revenue model and remarked, “You're making Rs 30,000 per month, isse acha thela laga lo”.The influencer-turned-founder’s pitch failed to impress other sharks, namely Namita Thapar and Aman Gupta. Namita Thapar, executive director at Emcure Pharmaceuticals argued that anyone defaulting on payments wouldn’t be persuaded by an automated voice message and could easily block or ignore the calls. While Boat Lifestyle CEO Aman Gupta probed further, asking Vijay if he was involved in anything else apart from this business. Vijay revealed that he is a social media influencer with around 1 million Instagram followers and also runs a profitable hotel bookings business.Lenskart’s Peyush Bansal shifted focus to Vijay's Instagram earnings, to which Vijay responded that he makes approximately Rs 5 lakh per month through the platform. While Peyush appeared impressed by his social media success, the other sharks weren’t as enthusiastic.","Vijay Nihalchandani, a business and finance influencer, presented his startup Make My Payment.

Despite the turmoil, he secured a spot on the podium. But preparing for this year's edition in Uttarakhand came with greater challenges.With the conflict in its second year, James, whose father runs a pig farm, had to stay in a hotel near the stadium - 16 km from home in Imphal East - for six months to train safely. ""Traveling back and forth daily was risky as tension could erupt anytime. It was not easy to train in such conditions. We could often hear sounds of gunshots and bombs going off nearby,"" he told TOI. He added that he struggled to maintain a proper diet, but parents of some junior players living near the stadium provided him with meals.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
