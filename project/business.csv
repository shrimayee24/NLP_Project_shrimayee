NIA takes over Jiribam cases



Missing person case from Loitang Khunou



Appeal for calm



Manipur MLAs' demands



NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh on Tuesday said that a series of measures by the Central and state governments are under way to address the recent violent incidents in Jiribam. Massive combing operations have been launched in Jiribam and its surrounding areas to apprehend the perpetrators, with Singh pointing out that the operations will continue until those responsible are booked under the rule of law.At a press conference, Singh outlined key resolutions adopted during a recent NDA legislature forum meeting in Manipur. These included a proposal to lift the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from six new police station areas, transferring the investigation of recent killings in Jiribam to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and intensifying counter-terrorism operations .""On November 18, the NDA legislature forum in Manipur took a decision and sent it to the Government of India for implementation. There are 3-4 points, including the removal of AFSPA from the 6 new Police stations (PS areas) and the case relating to Jiribam's heinous killing cases that will be handed over to the NIA, and mass combing operations against those terrorists will be continued. So, these are the few points which we adopted in the meeting and we sent to the Central government,"" the CM said.The chief minister confirmed that the Centre has accepted multiple points from the state’s proposals. The NIA has already taken charge of three key cases linked to the Jiribam violence and issued a press release announcing its involvement.""As requested, the NIA has taken over all three cases related to the Jiribam incidents,"" Singh said. ""The Central and State governments have initiated joint combing operations in Jiribam and adjoining areas. We will continue till the culprits are booked,"" he addedSingh also addressed the disappearance of a person from Loitang Khunou, stating that the police have filed a zero FIR and launched a search operation.""Today, a very unfortunate accident occurred, but not yet confirmed - one person from Loitang Khunou is missing. As per the report available to me, he went inside the Army campus for work, he was doing some financial work there for some officials. But, up to 2pm, he was in connection with his family. But after 2.30pm, the connection with him was lost. His phone turned off. Then the information came to the police and the police have already filed a zero FIR. Searching and investigation is on. We will continue it,"" he said.Amid escalating tensions, the chief minister appealed citizens to remain calm and refrain from violence, stressing the complexity of the issues.""Let us work together with the Government of India to resolve these matters, including the lifting of AFSPA. Violence will not solve these issues. I appeal to the people to stay calm and avoid emotional reactions,"" he said.Earlier, Manipur MLAs passed a resolution demanding a review of AFSPA and a declaration of Kuki militants, allegedly responsible for the Jiribam killings , as an “unlawful organisation.” They also called for a mass operation against the militants and the transfer of key cases to the NIA.The resolution came after the tragic killing of six civilians, including women and children, in Jiribam. In response, the state government temporarily suspended internet services in seven districts to prevent the spread of misinformation and unrest.","Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh outlined key resolutions adopted during a recent NDA legislature forum meeting in Manipur.

Russia eyes India for train manufacturing to meet some domestic demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-eyes-india-as-hub-for-train-manufacturing/articleshow/115710366.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Russia is eager to invest in and expand the manufacturing of trains and their components in India to meet its domestic requirements, a senior railway ministry official said on Tuesday. Last week, Russian railway major TMH had expressed interest in this plan.In response to a question on Russian investment in the railway sector in India, a top govt official said, “They have huge domestic requirements and for that they want to set up manufacturing facilities here. They want to get these supplies from India.”The CEO of TMH, Kirill Lipa told a group of Indian journalists at the company’s headquarters in Moscow, “The current interest rate in India is very different from other countries. So, we are interested and ready to invest in India. We are interested in developing several facilities in India, which are capable of providing certain components and we think some of them can be supplied to the Russian market as well.”Mentioning that Russia currently has several supply contracts from India, Lipa said, “We have a historically good relationship with suppliers there (India) and that means we can increase this import into Russia from India.”TMH is the major stakeholder in Kinet Railway Solutions, which has signed approximately Rs 55,000 crore contract with Indian Railways to produce 1,920 Vande Bharat sleeper coaches and maintain them for 35 years. Lipa said they are “not looking at getting any supply from Russia” for Vande Bharat project.“We found basic suppliers within India or some other countries which are more or less oriented for the relationship between India and Russia,” he said while claiming that the current sanctions will not have any implications on the project.","Last week, Russian railway major TMH had expressed interest in this plan.

SC: Suspicion of EVM fixing ‘unfounded’

NEW DELHI: Noting that it was only losing candidates who suspected tampering of electronic voting machines (EVMs), Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea seeking that voting be done through paper ballot and asked the petitioner to raise his grievances before the appropriate authority.""What happens is, if you win the elections, EVMs are not tampered. When you lose elections, EVMs are tampered,"" a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna B Varale said.

Now, this time, Jagan Mohan Reddy has lost, he said EVMs can be tampered,” the bench said.The petitioner also highlighted other flaws like cash and liquor distribution in the election process and sought the court’s intervention to check it. He said EC had seized Rs 9,000 crore so far this year. In April, SC had dismissed a batch of petitions seeking a return to the paper ballot system.

NEW DELHI: Virtually ruling out a mega oil refinery in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri, the govt is holding talks with Saudi authorities for two refineries in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, each with an annual capacity of 10-15 million tonnes, along with petrochemical facilities.While ONGC has been proposed to partner Saudi Aramco for the refinery in Gujarat, BPCL will be roped in for the one planned in Andhra. For the Saudis, the refineries will enable the sale of crude to India, given that the share of oil from the Gulf nation in the Indian basket has decreased over the years.The discussions, which are in advanced stages, come ahead of PM Modi's meeting with the Saudi leadership next month to tap into the oil-rich nation's earlier promise to invest $100 billion in India, which has been slow to come by despite the govt identifying railways, ports and waterways as areas of interest.While the refinery in Ratnagiri was among the identified projects, progress on land acquisition has been slow due to resistance from locals.Besides, there was a growing view that it would be tough to have a 60-million-tonne refinery, for which Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) had signed a preliminary agreement with Saudi Aramco, with Adnoc joining in later.Gujarat, which already boasts of refineries in Jamnagar (Reliance and Nyara Energy) and Vadodara (Indian Oil), is likely to get a fourth one. In case of Andhra Pradesh, an oil refinery was proposed at the time of bifurcation of the state, and the govt led by N Chandrababu Naidu, who is now part of NDA, is seeking that Centre delivers on its promise.While the configuration and other details have not been worked out, sources indicated that the projects are at discussion stage, along with other proposals, some of which will be faster to implement. ""Oil refineries take time, and the two proposed projects will require more detailed work before we progress on them,"" a source told TOI.The Saudi side is also seeking comfort in investment promotion through a revised bilateral investment treaty, an issue on which finance ministry has had concerns. ""It could be an added sweetener, but since the deal will be at the level of two govts, there may be some other way out,"" another source said.","The govt is holding talks with Saudi authorities for two refineries in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, each with an annual capacity of 10-15 million tonnes.

'Should one party decide what case SC should hear?'

NEW DELHI: Former Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on Tuesday addressed recent allegations from Shiv Sena (UBT)leader Sanjay Raut , who claimed that Chandrachud’s handling of petitions regarding disqualification of MLAs contributed to the Maha Vikas Aghadi 's (MVA) defeat in the recent Maharashtra Assembly elections .Speaking to ANI in an exclusive interview, Justice Chandrachud dismissed these allegations, emphasizing the Supreme Court's focus on significant constitutional matters during his tenure. ""Throughout this year, we were dealing with seminal constitutional cases, nine-judge bench decisions, seven-judge bench decisions, five-judge bench decisions. Should any one party or individual decide what case the Supreme Court should hear? Sorry, that choice is for the Chief Justice,"" he said.Sanjay Raut had alleged that by not ruling on disqualification petitions of defectors from the Shiv Sena, Justice Chandrachud ""removed the fear of the law"" among politicians, which led to the collapse of the MVA government and their subsequent electoral loss.In the November 20 elections, Shiv Sena (UBT) won only 20 out of 94 seats it contested as part of the MVA alliance, with Congress securing 16 out of 101 seats and the NCP (Sharad Pawar) winning just 10 of 86. Raut accused the judiciary of delaying decisions, impacting their political fortunes, and declared that ""history will not forgive them.""Justice Chandrachud, however, defended the judiciary's priorities. ""Important constitutional cases are pending before the Supreme Court for 20 years. Why is the Supreme Court not taking up these 20-year-old cases and dealing with some recent cases? You have limited manpower and a given complement of judges, you have to draw the balance,"" he said.Further responding to Raut's claim that the court delayed the Sena's disqualification case, Chandrachud criticised the expectation that courts should align with political agendas. ""The real problem is this, that a given segment of the polity feels that, well, you're independent if you follow my agenda... We decided electoral bonds. Was that any less important?"" he said, listing other cases handled during his tenure, including disability rights, the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, and significant judgments affecting federal structures and livelihoods.Talking about the claims of his involvement in furthering specific political agenda, Chandrachud also reacted to Rahul Gandhi's recent remark that the Opposition has taken on the judiciary's role. The ex-CJI said, ""People should not presume that the judiciary should be performing the role of the opposition in Parliament or the State legislatures. We are here to scrutinize laws.""The former CJI went on to defend his social interactions with political leaders, describing such meetings as ""elementary social courtesy"" that does not compromise judicial independence. He called on critics to assess the judiciary's work rather than dwell on social engagements.Chandrachud also reflected on the broader challenges of his role, particularly pressure from well-resourced litigants. ""Very highly resourced persons come to the court and try to suborn the system by saying, well, my case should be heard first. Sorry, we are not going to give that priority,"" he asserted, adding that the judiciary must resist such influences to remain impartial.He also dismissed suggestions of political pressure on the judiciary, referencing cases like Article 370, Ayodhya, and Sabarimala, where decisions were made without external interference. ""If there was pressure, why did the Supreme Court wait to take such a decision on that case?"" he questioned, reiterating the judiciary's independence.However, Justice Chandrachud highlighted systemic issues within the judiciary, calling for increased investment in infrastructure and an All-India Judicial Service Examination to address the 21% vacancy rate in district courts.

The complainant, a homemaker, lives with her retired husband (75) in the city while her two children are abroad.

MUMBAI: In perhaps the longest 'digital detention' in the city by cyber fraudsters posing as law enforcers, a 77-year-old south Mumbai woman was kept under 'digital custody' for more than a month. Threatened with arrest in a fake money laundering case , the accused duped her of Rs 3.8 crore, said the police.The complainant, a homemaker, lives with her retired husband (75) in the city while her two children are abroad.Police said she first received a WhatsApp call. The caller told her the parcel she had sent to Taiwan had been stopped and it contained five passports, a bank card, 4kg of clothes and MDMA drug, and so on. The woman told the caller she had not sent any parcel to anyone. The caller then said her Aadhar card details were used in the crime and asked her to talk to a Mumbai police officer. The call was transferred to a fake police officer who said her Aadhaar card was linked to a money laundering case which was under investigation, though she denied any involvement in it.""The complainant was then asked to download the Skype app and told that the police officers would talk to her through it. She was ordered not to disconnect and not to tell anyone about the case. A man posing as Anand Rana, IPS officer, sought details of her bank accounts. Later, another man claiming to be George Mathew, IPS, from the finance department, came on the call and asked her to transfer money into bank accounts given by them so that they could probe it. They told her the money would be returned to her if found to be 'clear',"" said a police officer. The accused also sent her a fake Mumbai crime branch notice with a police logo.The accused also asked the woman to continue her WhatsApp video call 24x7. She switched on the video call on her family computer. ""If the complainant disconnected the call or it got disconnected, the accused would call her up and ask her to connect again and keep checking her location,"" said a police officer.She was then instructed to go to the bank and transfer money and told if the bank inquired why she needed it, she could tell them that she wanted to buy a property.She transferred the money and the accused returned Rs 15 lakh into her account, saying it was clear. By returning the money, they gained her trust. They then asked her to send all her money from her and her husband's joint accounts. Over a period of time, she transferred Rs 3.8 crore into six bank accounts.She suspected something was amiss when she did not get her money back while the accused kept demanding more funds for taxes and ""clearing money"" while keeping her under ""voluntary surveillance"". She spoke to her daughter over the phone, who told her she was being conned and asked her to approach the police. She called the 1930 cyber helpline. Police have frozen six bank accounts of the accused.","A 77-year-old south Mumbai woman was kept under 'digital custody' for more than a month.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to relax the strict Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-4 measures being enforced in Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution, but suggested that educational institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR) could reopen for physical classes.The court also directed the Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) to consider relaxing norms to allow schools to reopen, noting that a large number of students cannot avail mid-day meals, online classes and do not have access to air purifiers, reported news agency ANI.The top court also came down heavily on the authorities, asking the CAQM to take action against the Delhi government, city police and others responsible for not complying with its order under GARP-4 to prevent the entry of trucks into the national capital.Despite permitting relaxation of GRAP-4 measures in order to allow physical classes, the court noted that it could not order curbs below GRAP-3 or GRAP-2 unless it is satisfied with the consistent decrease in the Air Quality Index (AQI).The court also asked the state governments to use the labour cess it collected for the subsistence of the labourers during the construction ban.As of now, schools have been instructed to conduct classes online, with the heads of educational institutions ensuring that parents are informed promptly. The latest updates from the government have provided no clarity on when physical classes might resume.While the air quality in Delhi has improved slightly, with AQI levels dipping below the 300-mark on Monday morning, the pollution levels still remain in the ‘poor’ category. This continues to be a concern for residents, especially for children and elderly people. Experts advise that precautions should still be taken to minimize exposure to harmful pollutants.","The Supreme Court on Monday refused to relax the strict Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-4 measures being enforced in Delhi-NCR.

While India slammed his arrest, Bangladesh accused it of violating the spirit of friendship between the two countries.

NEW DELHI: Tensions between India and Bangladesh over the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, escalated further on Tuesday with New Delhi slamming the interim govt in Dhaka for the arrest of Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari and the Yunus govt accusing India of violating the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two countries.India's ministry of external affairs (MEA), in an official statement, expressed ""deep concern"" over the arrest of the religious leader in Bangladesh, saying while the perpetrators of violence against Hindus and other minorities remained at large, charges were being pressed against him for presenting legitimate demands through peaceful gatherings.Bangladesh hit back later in the evening calling the issue an ""internal affair"", and saying that such ""unfounded"" statements not only misrepresent facts but also ""stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighbouring countries"". The interim govt also doubled down on the charges against Chinmoy Krishna saying the country's judiciary is fully independent and it does not interfere in the work of the judiciary.The Indian govt, which has repeatedly taken up the issue of safety of minority communities with the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt in Dhaka, also asked Bangladesh authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities, including their right of freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.""We have noted with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is also the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote.

Till 2024, ‘judge to population’ ratio yet to reach 25/m: SC

NEW DELHI: In defence of more than 22,000 trial court judges saddled with a monstrous pendency of over 4.5 crore cases, Supreme Court said the SC and high courts, in exercise of their appellate jurisdiction, cannot resort to personal criticism of judicial officers' conduct while correcting errors in their judgments.Expunging Delhi HC's critical personal remarks against additional sessions and district judge Sonu Agnihotri, a bench of Justices A S Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and A G Masih said, ""The HC could not have used a judgment on the judicial side to advise individual judicial officers. That can only be done on the administrative side in an appropriate case.""Referring to spiralling litigation, the bench said in 2002, SC in All India Judges Association case had issued a direction that “within five years, an endeavour should be made to increase the judge-topopulation ratio in our trial judiciary to 50 per million”. “However, till 2024, we have not even reached the ratio of 25 per million. Meanwhile, population and litigation have substantially increased. The judges have to work under stress,” it said. SC said even the best judges, whether in a trial court, HC or in SC, are likely to commit errors due to work pressure or otherwise, even though most of their judgments would be sound in both fact and law.HCs can always correct errors, but in that process if strictures are passed personally against a judicial officer, it both prejudices him and causes embarrassment, the Justice Oka-led bench said. “We must remember that when we sit in constitutional courts, even we are prone to making mistakes. Therefore, personal criticism of judges or recording findings on the conduct of judges in judgments must be avoided,” the bench said. “There is a difference between criticising erroneous orders and criticising a judicial officer. The first part is permissible. The second category of criticism should best be avoided,” it said.HC had criticised the additional sessions judge (ASJ) for taking Delhi Police to task for its lethargic approach in updating investigation status despite repeated orders. SC ordered that all critical personal comments against ASJ in the HC judgment be expunged.","Till 2024, ‘judge to population’ ratio yet to reach 25/m: SC.

RAIPUR: The Border Roads Organization (BRO) has stepped into dreaded Maoist commander Hidma's den in Bastar division to build roads that no civilian contractor dared take up. BRO is known for its expertise in building roads in treacherous, mountainous regions of Ladakh and the North-East, and Chhattisgarh is perhaps the only Maoist-affected state where it has been deployed, said an officer. BRO teams started work in a remote part of Bijapur on Monday.In 2004-06, during a period of intense Maoist violence, BRO had constructed a 100km road between Jagdalpur and Geedam in Dantewada. It's still the best in Bastar. This time, the assignment has taken the road specialists to the most volatile hotbed of Maoist insurgency in Bastar. BRO will build two roads, from Hidma's Puwarti village to Silger, and from Tarrem to Kondapalli.Puwarti is Hidma's native village and barely 2km from Tekulguda where 23 security personnel were killed in a Maoist ambush in April 2021. And Silger was the site of intense protests after three villagers were killed in police firing on May 17, 2021.Local contractors were too scared to take up projects in these areas and multiple tenders got no response. According to sources, the Union home minister intervened and BRO was given the task.Officials are not sharing details of the routes but said that Tarrem and Kondapalli road will be 18km long and the one from Silger to Puwarti is planned to be 11km. The Tarrem-Kondapalli stretch is expected to be completed by June 2025 and will cost around Rs 40 crore. ""This is another step towards achieving the target of Union home minister Amit Shah 's vow to eliminate Maoists by March 2026,"" Bastar range IG P Sundarraj said.It’s believed that around 200 Maoists are in this region to provide security to Hidma and carry out insurgency. It has the largest concentration of PLGA cadres, and the routes planned by the govt have great strategic importance. Asked about deployment of security during road construction, Bijapur collector Sambit Mishra told TOI, “BRO is constructing roads on the most critical junctions of Bijapur.There are around five CRPF security camps at Tarrem, Chinnagelur, Gundem, Chutwahi and Kondapalli. CoBRA and Special Task Force personnel conduct ops.”Three more road projects are in the pipeline, awaiting approval — Kondapalli to Pamed (26km), Meenagudam to Kanchal (13km) and Elmagunda to Puvarti (51km).The new roads will not only allow security forces quick access to core Maoist zones, but also help the govt reach its welfare and development schemes to villages. Health and education facilities will improve significantly, so will mobile connectivity, said officials. It’s a turning point in the decades-old conflict, where IED-mined roads have a dark history of blood and death.","Border Roads Organization (BRO) has stepped into dreaded Maoist commander Hidma's den in Bastar division.

SECI deal

amid US bribery scandal last resort: AP mantri

VIJAYAWADA: The Chandrababu Naidu-led govt in Andhra Pradesh is exploring a number of options to make the 2021 Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) deal more palatable after the bribery scandal allegedly involving the Adani Group was reported in the US.Sources told TOI the state govt was not in favour of scrapping the deal, given the legal complications involved. Instead, it was negotiating the possibility of setting up the solar plant in Andhra instead of another state. This would substantially reduce transmission costs. If the power was available with minimal transmission cost, Rs 2.49 per unit was reasonable, said a senior minister.The TDP govt has argued that although Rs 2.4 per unit of solar power was reasonable, they would have to pay an additional Rs 1.7 per unit as transmission cost as the original plan included drawing power from Rajasthan.The Jagan-led YSRC govt in AP at the time had originally proposed signing an agreement with Adani Group to purchase 9,000 MW of solar power. As it had drawn severe criticism from the opposition, which alleged unilateral allotment of the contract to Adani Group, without competitive bidding, the state govt retracted from its original proposal and later announced the proposed deal with SECI for the purchase of 7,000 MW for agriculture use.The minister added that the TDP-led NDA govt's aim was to bring more investment into Andhra Pradesh and create job opportunities. ""We are an industry-friendly govt. We want more investors to come in. Scrapping the SECI deal because of the bribery scandal in the US is the last option to consider,"" he said.Sources said if setting up the plant is not possible, the state govt may propose a price revision in accordance with prevailing market prices. State finance minister and TDP veteran Payyavula Keshav was the first to object to the deal in 2021 when he was in opposition.On the other hand, the state govt is also considering legal opinion on initiating a probe into the corruption allegations. Sources said the state govt is waiting for the Centre to take a decision on the issue before taking a call.Andhra Pradesh was at the centre of the alleged bribery scandal that broke out in the US earlier this month in which Adani Group's top executives, including Gautam Adani, were indicted on criminal charges by Eastern District Court of New York. The indictment alleged that Rs 2,029 crore was offered as bribes to ""Indian govt officials"" for signing power purchase agreements (PPAs).Out of the total Rs 2,029 crore, Rs 1,750 crore was allegedly offered to a high-ranking official in the AP govt, mentioned as ""foreign official#1"" in the documents.According to the indictment, the official was offered Rs 1,750 crore, causing state discoms to agree to purchase seven gigawatts of solar power from SECI under the manufacturing linked project.","The Chandrababu Naidu-led govt in Andhra Pradesh is exploring a number of options to make the 2021 Solar Energy Corporation of India deal more palatable.

Crane's reverse migration path remarkable, say specialists

AIPUR: A tagged Siberian Demoiselle crane has soared further in the pecking order of long flights, taking a detour to wing over 3,676km to Rajasthan and setting a new distance record for migratory birds arriving in the state.Nicknamed Sukpak, the crane swooped down to Khichan in Phalodi district. It was clicked by an Australian tourist, Carolyn Synnott, at Khichan's renowned feeding station. Sukpak was identified by a distinctive yellow-blue ring on its leg. The previous longest recorded flight for a Demoiselle crane was about 2,800km, for a bird tagged in Mongolia. ""This is a male crane, tagged by our team on July 20, 2024. He was the elder of a two-chick brood,"" said Elena Mudrik, a Russian crane researcher.Dau Lal Bohra, member of a Crane Specialist Group at International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and a contributor to the 1000 Crane Project, attributed Sukpak's record-breaking distance to the fact that it was ringed - tagged for identification - in far-flung Tyva, a republic in south-central Siberia of Russia.""Tyva borders northwestern Mongolia and lies in the upper Yenisey river basin. Due to the region's harsh conditions, this was the first time researchers successfully ringed birds there. Since the ringing was done at a further location, it increased the migration distance,"" said Bohra.What makes Sukpak's journey more remarkable is its unexpected route through Pakistan. ""Traditionally, Demoiselle cranes cross Himalayan valleys and enter India via Nepal. However, Sukpak's route traversed Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan before it entered India through Jaisalmer. This is the reverse of the usual migration path, typically observed during their return journey. It is the most significant discovery in Demoiselle crane migration patterns,"" Bohra said.At present, nearly 20,000 Demoiselle cranes - Kurjan in local parlance - are roosting at Khichan for their winter sojourn. Recently designated as a conservation reserve, Khichan has become a safe haven for these majestic birds. ""Khichan is India's first reserve for Demoiselle cranes. This milestone not only enriches our understanding of bird migration but also highlights the need to conserve these species and their habitats,"" an expert said.","Nicknamed Sukpak, the crane swooped down to Khichan in Phalodi district.

NEW DELHI: Disregarding resistance from its ally Shiv Sena , BJP has pressed ahead with its effort to restore Devendra Fadnavis as CM of Maharashtra.Sources indicated that this decision has been communicated to NCP ( Ajit Pawar faction) which is comfortable with the idea of Fadnavis's return to the office he held between 2014 and 2019 and then, briefly, for a few days in 2019. There are indications that the decision will soon be conveyed to Sena which has pressed for the continuation of incumbent, Eknath Shinde BJP insiders expressed hope that Shinde would come around because of the huge numbers at BJP's disposal: it won 132 seats and reach the magic mark of 145 with the support of Ajit Pawar's group of 41 as well as its ""silent"" supporters scattered among other parties.Sources said the party will offer the post of deputy CMs to Sena (Shinde) and Ajit Pawar's group, though other crucial details, such as who gets what portfolios and how many, are yet to be worked out.While Shiv Sena and NCP have elected Shinde and Pawar as their legislative party leaders respectively, BJP has not yet made its official announcement, but Fadnavis's selection as the leader of the party has looked a foregone conclusion since Saturday when BJP romped home with a record-shattering tally on the strength of the strategy and ground game he had scripted.It's understood that both Fadnavis and Shinde are heading to the national capital to meet home minister Amit Shah to resolve the leadership issue and discuss government formation.Shiv Sena spokesperson Naresh Mhaske cited the Bihar model, suggesting Shinde should continue as CM. BJP MLC Pravin Darekar endorsed Fadnavis for the CM post, emphasising his capability to lead the state.","BJP has pressed ahead with its effort to restore Devendra Fadnavis as CM of Maharashtra.

Devika Rotawan , who survived the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack and served as a key witness identifying terrorist Ajmal Kasab during the trial, experienced a life-altering change.Devika was only nine when she was caught in gunfire at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) on November 26, 2008. She sustained a bullet wound in her leg, which still causes her discomfort, particularly during winter.In a conversation with PTI on the 16th anniversary of the 26/11 attacks , 25-year-old Devika expressed the indelible nature of that night's memories.""It's been 16 years, but I can still remember what I was doing, where I was going, and how the attack happened,"" she said. She recounted travelling to Pune with her father and brother on November 26, 2008, to meet her elder sibling.""We had just arrived at CSMT from Bandra when a bomb blast occurred, followed by a barrage of gunfire. People of all ages were badly injured,"" she said.Initially taken to St George's Hospital with other victims, Devika was subsequently moved to JJ Hospital due to the overwhelming situation. There, she underwent surgery for bullet removal.""I was unconscious for a while,"" she said, noting her recovery lasted over a month. Post-discharge, Devika returned to Rajasthan, though the incident's impact persisted. When approached by Mumbai Crime Branch about testifying, her family readily agreed.""We agreed because both my father and I had seen the terrorists, and I could identify Ajmal Kasab, the man who caused so much pain,"" Devika added. Her testimony proved vital in Kasab's trial and subsequent conviction.""I wanted to kill him, but I was just nine. I could do nothing but identify him in court,"" Devika recalled, noting that Kasab's memory, the lone surviving terrorist, remains with her.Having lost her mother in 2006, Devika aspired to become an officer to combat terrorism. ""Terrorism should be eradicated. People must speak out against the wrongdoings in our society. It all starts from Pakistan, and that must be stopped,"" she said, acknowledging the Indian government's professional handling of such situations.Despite receiving support from many, some relatives distanced themselves after the incident, though they've recently resumed contact. Currently, Devika continues her physical recovery whilst maintaining her determination.""I still feel pain in my leg, and sometimes it swells during the winter, but I am proud that I stood up for what was right. People should come forward and stand with victims,"" she added.Approaching the 26/11 anniversary, she encouraged public remembrance of victims and unity against terrorism. ""Terrorism must end, and people must remember what happened on that night. We need to stand with the victims,"" Devika added.A graduate now, Devika resides in rented accommodation in Bandra east.The Bombay High Court instructed Maharashtra's government to consider her request for EWS housing allocation with sensitivity. She received an initial compensation of Rs 3.26 lakh, similar to other survivors.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis assisted with Rs 10 lakh for medical treatment, she noted. Though allocated housing, Devika awaits possession.On November 26, 2008, ten Pakistani terrorists arrived by sea, initiating indiscriminate attacks that killed 166 people, including 18 security personnel, injured many others, and caused extensive property damage. Notable casualties included ATS chief Hemant Karkare, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, and Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar.The attack, beginning November 26, 2008, continued until November 29, targeting locations including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Oberoi Trident, Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital, and Nariman House Jewish Community Centre.Security forces eliminated nine terrorists.

""On 26th January 1950, India will be an independent country,"" father of Indian Constitution BR Ambedkar had said as he presented the draft of Indian Constitution 75 years ago. But this optimism was accompanied by the anxiety of ""Will she maintain her independence or will she lose it again?""Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his wishes to the citizens saying, ""Happy Constitution Day to all countrymen on the auspicious occasion of 75th anniversary of the Indian Constitution,"" as he went on to explain the significance of the book.This comes a day after the Supreme Court rejected petitions that sought to challenge the 1976 amendment to the Constitution, which introduced the terms ""socialist,"" ""secular,"" and ""integrity"" into the Preamble. These words were added through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment, passed during the tenure of the Indira Gandhi government.Constitution Day, or 'Samvidhan Divas,' is observed annually on November 26 to mark the adoption of the Constitution of India.On this day in 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted the Constitution, which came into force on January 26, 1950.On November 19, 2015, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment announced the Government of India's decision to observe November 26 as 'Constitution Day' each year, with the aim of promoting the values enshrined in the Constitution among citizens.From being used as a weapon in politics to being a tool for the judiciary, the book has single-handedly acted as the legislative, the executive and the judiciary.To sum up Ambedkar's apprehensions about the success of the Constitution, one may recall his own quote: . “Indeed, if I may say so, if things go wrong under the new Constitution, the reason will not be that we had a bad Constitution. What we will have to say is, that Man was vile.”","On this day in 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted the Constitution, which came into force on January 26, 1950.

City Palace entry denied



Administration steps in



Long-standing family feud



NEW DELHI: Udaipur witnessed a heated confrontation on Monday night as tensions flared between two factions of the erstwhile royal family of Mewar, resulting in stone pelting and a standoff at the historic City Palace.The clash followed the coronation of BJP MLA Vishvaraj Singh Mewar as the 77th Maharana of Mewar earlier that day at Chittorgarh Fort.The ceremony came after the recent passing of Vishvaraj Singh’s father, Mahendra Singh Mewar. However, the event was overshadowed by a long-standing feud between Mahendra Singh Mewar and his estranged younger brother, Arvind Singh Mewar . Both are descendants of the legendary Rajput king Maharana Pratap.Hours after the coronation, Vishvaraj Singh and his supporters were denied entry into the City Palace and the family deity’s Eklingnath Temple in Udaipur. Both sites are managed by Arvind Singh, who serves as the chairman and managing trustee of the Shree Eklingji Trust.Arvind Singh issued a public notice opposing Vishvaraj Singh’s planned visit as part of post-coronation rituals, further intensifying the family dispute.When Vishvaraj Singh and his supporters attempted to enter the City Palace, tensions escalated into a physical altercation. Stone pelting ensued between his supporters and those loyal to Arvind Singh and Dr Lakshay Raj Singh Mewar, Arvind Singh’s son.To control the situation, the district administration intervened. Udaipur district collector Arvind Kumar Poswal assured the public that law and order had been restored.“The situation is under control. Talks are ongoing with both palace representatives and society members. Certain issues have been resolved, while discussions continue on others,” he told reporters.The administration also took the disputed Dhuni Mata Temple, another contested site, into receivership to prevent further clashes. “If either group wishes to file a case, it will be registered,” Poswal added.The dispute is the latest chapter in the long-standing rivalry within the royal family. Vishvaraj Singh’s anointment as Maharana has deepened the divide, with factions loyal to Arvind Singh opposing his ascension.Supporters of Nathdwara MLA Vishvaraj Singh camped at Jagdish Chowk, a few kilometers away from the City Palace after being barred entry, further fueling the confrontation.","Clash followed the coronation of BJP MLA Vishvaraj Singh Mewar as the 77th Maharana of Mewar earlier that day at Chittorgarh Fort.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers. Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) issued a four-year suspension to wrestler Bajrang Punia on Tuesday for declining to submit a sample during national team selection trials on March 10. Following NADA 's initial suspension on April 23, the sport's world governing body, UWW, also imposed sanctions on the Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist.After Bajrang contested the provisional suspension, NADA's Anti-Disciplinary Doping panel (ADDP) temporarily lifted it on May 31, pending the issuance of a formal notice of charge.""In the present case, since the Athlete had been provisionally suspended, the Panel accordingly holds that the Athlete's period of his ineligibility for the period of 4 years shall commence from the date on which the notification was sent, i.e., 23.04.2024,"" the ADDP said in its order.Bajrang, who recently joined Congress alongside fellow wrestler Vinesh Phogat and assumed leadership of All India Kisan Congress, had submitted a written challenge to the charges on July 11. This was followed by hearings conducted on September 20 and October 4.""The Panel holds that the Athlete is liable for sanctions under Article 10.3.1 and liable for ineligibility for a period of 4 years,"" the ADDP order read. ""Needless to say that on account of the lifting of the provisional suspension for the period from 31.05.2024 to 21.06.2024 shall not be credited into the total period of ineligibility of four years.""Bajrang has consistently stated that he received discriminatory and unjust treatment during doping control procedures, attributing this to his participation in protests against formerWrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.He clarified that he never declined to provide a sample, but rather sought clarification from NADA regarding their use of expired testing kits during his December 2023 sample collection.""It was not an outright refusal per se. The athlete was always willing to provide his sample provided that he first received a response from NADA concerning the use of expired kits.""NADA defended its position by stating that their Chaperone/DCO had properly approached Bajrang and informed him about the requirement to provide a urine sample for doping analysis.""The Athlete has demonstrated utter disregard towards his duties and responsibilities as per Articles 20.1 & 20.2 of the Anti Doping Rules, 2021,"" NADA had said in its response.",Bajrang Punia has been handed a four-year suspension by the National Anti-Doping Agency.

Imagine a future in which you will have to work only 3 and half days a week - that's what JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon thinks is possible with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Jamie Dimon maintains an optimistic outlook on AI influence on the workforce.Despite advocating traditional workplace values like diligence, preparedness and office attendance, the American business leader suggests that future workforce might benefit from reduced working hours due to AI implementation.Contrary to predictions of widespread job losses, he emphasises that the technology is enhancing business operations and improving employees' work-life balance, ET reported The Fortune as saying.Dimon anticipates a significant reduction in working hours, suggesting employees might only need three and a half days per week, as AI could automate 60% to 70% of current tasks.

Manufacturing return



WASHINGTON: Donald Trump on Tuesday named Jamieson Greer his trade envoy, a key figure in implementing the president-elect's economic agenda, particularly his plans to use tariffs to raise revenue and help bring more manufacturing to US shores.Trump also picked Kevin Hassett as his top economic advisor, bringing the former member of his first administration to the helm of the White House National Economic Council . Hassett is set to help advance Trump's plans too, ranging from tax cuts to widening energy production.""Jamieson played a key role during my First Term in imposing Tariffs on China and others to combat unfair Trade practices,"" said Trump of Greer, who served as chief of staff to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during Trump's first administration.He also cited Greer's experience in helping to see through a trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada.Greer is a partner at law firm King & Spalding.During Trump's first term from 2017 to 2021, the United States introduced tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imports -- notably on China but also America's allies.In particular, the Trump administration imposed levies on some $300 billion in Chinese goods as Washington and Beijing engaged in an escalating tariff war.Lighthizer emerged as a strongman in trade talks as he sought to force changes in Beijing's economic policies.If confirmed by the Senate, Greer, who is viewed as Lighthizer's protege, will be charged with rolling out Trump's tariff policy and negotiating trade deals.Trump on Tuesday lauded Greer's efforts under Lighthizer, saying this helped bring manufacturing jobs back to America.As US Trade Representative, Greer is set to work on reining in the country's trade deficit, protecting American industries and widening export markets, Trump added.Trump has vowed sweeping tariffs of at least 10 percent on allies and adversaries alike, and a steeper level on China.The aim is to raise government revenue and target countries he said have been ""ripping us off,"" while pushing businesses to bring production back to US shores.Even before he takes office in January, Trump has threatened to begin his presidency with an immediate trade war against three top US economic partners: China, Mexico and Canada.It remains unclear what role Lighthizer might assume in Trump's second term, but he is expected to remain influential within the president-elect's orbit.Greer's earlier role at the USTR's office means he was involved in Washington's decisions to impose tariffs on Beijing in Trump's first term, and come to a ""Phase One"" trade deal in 2020.The deal marked a truce in the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.But China has yet to meet its commitments of boosting purchases of American products and services over 2020 and 2021, as the world grappled with the Covid-19 pandemic.","Donald Trump names Jamieson Greer his trade envoy.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang received an honorary degree in engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology recently. During a recent interview at Hong Kong University, Huang said that he asks his artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to 'torture' it into teaching him new things. Encouraging people to get “an AI as a tutor”, he said that he often talks to his chatbot. “I use my AI,” he said, “and I torture my AI to teach me.” Explaining further, Huang said that he asks five follow-up questions to AI.The Nvidia CEO begins by asking the AI to explain why it provided its answer. Next, he prompts it to break down the reasoning step by step. Then, he has it reframe the explanation in different ways.Afterward, he asks the chatbot to apply the same reasoning to a different scenario. He concludes by requesting analogies to clarify the concept further.Earlier in a speech, Huang addressed engineering students, declaring that ""the age of AI has begun."" He described it as a transformative computing era poised to revolutionize every industry and scientific discipline.Huang, the 61-year-old leader of the world’s most valuable chipmaker, expressed his excitement about the opportunities available today, admitting he wished he had started his career during this pivotal time. “The whole world is reset. You're at the starting lines with everybody else. An industry is being reinvented.
