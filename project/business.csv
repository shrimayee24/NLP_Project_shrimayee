0 visibility for 9 hours: Worst fog of season blinds city,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/0-visibility-for-9-hours-worst-fog-of-season-blinds-city/articleshow/116952045.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flights were cancelled, trains ran late, and weekend road traffic was sluggish as the national capital was enveloped in a thick fog blinding it for as long as 12 hours, starting late Friday night until Saturday morning. This occurred against a backdrop of cold and polluted weather. A yellow alert was issued by the Met, expecting moderate to dense fog on Sunday and light to very light rain on Monday.According to IMD, on Saturday, very dense fog led to zero visibility, which lasted for nine hours at Palam and six hours at Safdarjung, making it the season's worst fog situation for the national capital. Weather scientists cited no winds, an abundance of moisture near the surface layer, and a highly stable surface boundary layer as reasons for this situation.The fog conditions also impacted a large area of the Indo-Gangetic plains.The formation of very dense fog leading to zero visibility for over eight hours impacted flight operations for the third consecutive day at IGI airport. According to FlightRadar24, over 400 flights were delayed, and the average delay was 34 minutes. Airport officials said that 19 flights, of which two were international, were diverted while some flights were cancelled. However, around 45 flights were cancelled either due to bad weather at the destination or other operational reasons from Delhi, airport officials added.A dense fog across the Indo-Gangetic plain wreaked havoc on train services, leaving 1.5 to 2 lakh passengers stranded or delayed while travelling to and from Delhi. The severe weather disrupted around 100 trains, with 49 requiring rescheduling due to maintenance needs. However, the delay led to major disruptions, particularly for key trains including the Vande Bharat Express to Mata Vaishno Devi, Varanasi, Khajuraho, Ayodhya, and services such as the Lucknow Swarn Shatabdi and Amritsar Shatabdi, all of which faced delays of over four hours.On Saturday, the city's base station, Safdarjung, recorded a minimum temperature of 7.8 degrees Celsius, 0.9 notches above normal.","Dense fog blankets Delhi for 12 hours, disrupting flights, trains and road traffic.

"PM Modi hails rise in rural consumption, says vision is to empower villages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-hails-rise-in-rural-consumption-says-vision-is-to-empower-villages/articleshow/116951986.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday celebrated the rise in rural consumption, citing the recent household consumption expenditure survey, and a dip in poverty as underlined in an SBI study released a day before.The consumption expenditure survey that showed rural households are diversifying their spend and devoting a larger part of expenditure on non-food items. ""Our vision is to empower rural India by transforming villages into vibrant centres of growth and opportunity... I am confident that the development of villages will lead to the realisation of a developed India,"" Modi said while inaugurating the six-day Grameen Bharat Mahotsav here at Bharat Mandapam. His remarks on the changed face of rural India came amid preparations for the Union Budget.The study by SBI, released on Friday, noted that rural poverty fell sharply from nearly 26% in 2011-12 to 7% in 2022-23, and further to less than 5% in 2023-24.The consumption expenditure survey, released last month, showed that the urban-rural gap in the monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) declined to 71% in 2022-23 from 84% in 2011-12. It further came down to 70% in 2023-24, confirming sustained momentum of consumption growth in rural areas. The survey also showed that non-food items remained the major contributor to a household's average monthly expenditure in 2023-24 with about 53% and 60% share in MPCE in rural and urban areas, respectively.Citing figures from the SBI study on poverty, Modi took a swipe at the previous Congress govts' 'Garibi Hatao' slogan, saying while some people have been raising slogans to eradicate poverty for decades, the country is now witnessing a real reduction in poverty.Referring to the consumption expenditure survey, which shows that average MPCE in rural India increased from Rs 1,430 in 2011-12 to Rs 4,122 in 2023-24, Modi said the figures reveal that the purchasing power of people in rural India has nearly tripled, indicating that people are spending more on their preferred items.The PM said previously, villagers had to spend more than 50% of their income on food, but for the first time since Independence, the expenditure on food in rural areas has fallen below 50%, and this meant people are now spending on other desires and needs, improving their quality of life.He noted that these achievements could have been realised during the tenure of previous govts, but for decades after Independence, lakhs of villages were deprived of basic necessities.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, ""PSBs are already operating credit saturation drives in priority sectors for schemes such as PM MUDRA Yojana, PM Awas Yojana, and SVAnidhi Yojana. Taking the momentum further, the Grameen Bharat Mahotsav showcases India's rich cultural heritage as well as the aspirations of rural people and development in the four areas -GI Tags, natural farming, women empowerment, tribal welfare, with a focus on Northeast products.""","The consumption expenditure survey that showed rural households are diversifying their spend and devoting a larger part of expenditure on non-food items.

Lakshadweep divers bump into wreck of centuries-old warship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lakshadweep-divers-bump-intowreck-of-centuries-old-warship/articleshow/116951968.cms,"Divers discovered the wreck of a probable European warship near Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep on Saturday. The ship, dating back to the 17th or 18th centuries, includes a cannon and anchor, suggesting historic maritime battles.

CHENNAI: A group of divers exploring marine life near Kalpeni island in the Lakshadweep archipelago stumbled on Saturday morning upon the wreck of what, it appeared, had been a warship.Going by the nature of the wreck, researchers believe the ship, fitted with cannon, might have belonged to any of the three European powers - Portuguese, Dutch, or British - and was sunk sometime during the fight for supremacy over the ancient maritime route connecting the Middle East and Sri Lanka in the 17th and 18th centuries.“When we spotted the wreck on the western side of Kalpeni, we didn’t know it was a warship. When we found a cannon and an anchor, we realised it could be an important find,” said Satyajeet Mane, a marine explorer who led the group of divers from Brannadives, a local divers’ group that included Nasrulla and Sajudheen.They said they would inform the local authorities about the find. ""We found it at a depth of just four or five metres at the mouth of a lagoon. The wreckage appears to be spread over the deeper parts of the Arabian Sea,"" said Mane. ""Going by the size of the ship, the cannon, and the metal, it could be a European warship. More exploration is needed.""Idrees Babu, a scientist at the department of science and technology and a mentor to the divers' group, said such a shipwreck has not been recorded in the region earlier. tnn""The ship might have been 50m-60m in length. The East India Company started using iron ships on this trade route in the 17th century or 18th century. We need underwater archaeological studies to learn more about it; till then we need to protect the site,"" he said.When the British used iron ships, the Portuguese continued to use ships made of iron and wood. ""The coral growth on the wreckage and corrosion makes it difficult to immediately ascertain if the ship was made fully of iron or it had components of wood too. The coral growth indicates it has been submerged for a few centuries,"" said Mane.","Divers stumble upon wreck of probable European warship near Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep.

'India well-prepared': Government says closely monitoring HMPV situation in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-well-prepared-government-says-closely-monitoring-hmpv-situation-in-china/articleshow/116947440.cms,"'Nothing to be alarmed about present situation': Director General of Health Services

What is HMPV?

NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry on Saturday said that India is ""closely monitoring"" the situation regarding a new variant of the human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ). The ministry also mentioned that it has requested the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to provide ""timely updates"" on the situation in China and that ""India is well-prepared"" to manage any potential rise in respiratory illnesses.The health ministry said that the surge in respiratory illnesses observed in China was consistent with the seasonal flu patterns. It said that reports indicate that the increase in cases is primarily due to Influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)—all common pathogens associated with the flu season.The ministry noted that these viruses are already circulating globally, including in India, and there is no indication of an unusual rise in respiratory cases.It said that while there is no cause for alarm, as a precaution, the ICMR will increase the number of laboratories testing for HMPV and will continue to monitor trends throughout the year, the statement said.The ministry urged the public to follow standard health precautions, including avoiding close contact when exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness.On Friday, Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Atul Goel, had explained that after analysing the data on respiratory outbreaks in India, there had been no significant rise in cases during December 2024, and no large-scale outbreaks were reported from Indian institutions.""There is news doing the rounds about a Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) outbreak in China. However, we have analysed the data of the respiratory outbreaks in the country (India) and there is no substantial increase in the December 2024 data and no cases which have been reported in large numbers from any of our institutions. There is nothing to be alarmed about the present situation,"" Goel said.He added that hospitals are well-equipped to manage the typical winter surge in respiratory infections. Goel also urged the public to follow standard precautions, such as avoiding close contact with others if experiencing symptoms.Meanwhile, China downplayed the severity of the outbreak, stating that this year’s respiratory infections were less severe than last year’s and assured that it remains safe for foreign travellers.Reports from China have raised concerns about a surge in respiratory infections, attributed to the HMPV. While some social media posts highlight overwhelmed hospitals, Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) have not declared a state of emergency. This increase in infections comes during the winter season, a time when respiratory illnesses naturally peak.HMPV, discovered in 2001, belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, alongside the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It causes symptoms similar to the common cold or flu, such as coughing, a runny nose, and fever. It can be particularly severe for children under five, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems or chronic respiratory conditions like asthma.HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets, close contact, and contaminated surfaces. There is no specific treatment or vaccine, so management focuses on symptom relief. Preventative measures, such as handwashing, wearing masks, and avoiding contact when ill, are recommended.","The Union health ministry on Saturday said that India is ""closely monitoring"" the situation regarding a new variant of the human metapneumovirus ( HMPV) The ministry also mentioned that it has requested the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to provide ""timely updates"" on the situation in China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116947433,imgsize-811473,width-400,resizemode-4/116947433.jpg"

Kishor, who is on an indefinite hunger strike demanding justice for students impacted by the alleged Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) exam question paper leak, dismissed the issue as a distraction.""Let this van be taken away and in return, give me Rs 25 lakh per day and provide an alternate space that can be used as washroom,"" Kishor said, as reported by news agency PTI.He defended the presence of the vehicle, stating it served as a practical necessity during his fast.""I am on a fast here. If I go home to relieve myself, then journalists will ask questions whether I went to have food or take a nap... Some people said the vanity van is worth Rs 2 crore and the rent for the same is Rs 25 lakh per day,"" he remarked.He further questioned whether similar scrutiny would be applied to facilities enjoyed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.""Will you be able to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar about the amenities they enjoy?"" Kishor questioned.Kishor’s hunger strike has entered its third day amid a biting cold wave in Patna. His protest calls for the cancellation of the 70th Combined Competitive Examination held on December 13, following claims of widespread malpractice, including the sale of exam seats. ""More than half the BPSC seats were sold,"" he alleged, adding that the position of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) is being openly traded for Rs 1.5 crore.The district administration has deemed Kishor’s protest illegal, citing a Patna high court directive that restricts demonstrations to Gardani Bagh. An FIR has been lodged against him and 150 of his supporters, with officials warning of further action if the protest site is not vacated.Despite the mounting pressure, Kishor has vowed to continue his hunger strike until the Bihar government addresses the demands of the protesting students. ""There is no question of withdrawing my fast, not until the demands of the students are met. We suggested from our end that the CM should meet the students and together they should bring out a solution. If that happens then I have no problem stopping the fast,"" he told news agency ANI.Also read:",Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor on Saturday reacted sharply to criticism over a luxury 'vanity van' parked near his protest site at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan.

Online Dating Scams Fake Job Offers or Investment Schemes

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Saturday arrested a 23-year-old individual who allegedly scammed more than 700 women after establishing connections on dating platforms by impersonating a US-based model. The West district's cyber police station arrested Tushar Bisht for exploiting platforms like Bumble and Snapchat to deceive victims, coerce them using personal images and recordings, and demand money, according to Delhi Police.""Posing as a US-based freelance model, the accused created fake identities using a virtual international mobile number and photographs of a Brazilian model,"" deputy commissioner of police (West), Vichitra Veer, said in the statement.Bisht utilised these fraudulent profiles to establish contact with women between 18 and 30 years on various online dating services.""His primary targets were users of Bumble, Snapchat and WhatsApp,"" the statement said.The DCP said that Bisht established trust through dialogue and persuaded them to share private and intimate images and videos.""Once he obtained the content, he resorted to blackmail, threatening to leak the sensitive material online, or sell them to dark web unless the victims paid him,"" the DCP said.Initial investigations showed the accused communicated with over 500 individuals on Bumble and 200 others across Snapchat and WhatsApp, authorities reported.The seized mobile device contained incriminating evidence, including victims' objectionable data, a virtual mobile number, and records of extortion-related financial dealings.Authorities confiscated 13 bank-issued credit cards, the statement added.The case came to light on December 13, when a Delhi University student reported to cyber police that she had connected with the accused on Bumble earlier that year.Claiming to be a US-based model visiting India professionally, he gained her confidence through regular communication.As their relationship developed, he convinced her to share private photos and videos via Snapchat and WhatsApp. He consistently avoided in-person meetings with various excuses, the DCP said.""The situation escalated when the accused sent her a private video she had shared, and demanded money. Pressured, the victim made small payments, citing her financial constraints. However, the relentless demands drove her to inform her family and lodge a complaint,"" the DCP said.Following an FIR registration, a dedicated team identified Bisht and located him in Shakarpur, east Delhi. A raid resulted in his arrest, the statement confirmed.Explaining his methods, the DCP revealed that during questioning, Bisht acknowledged using a virtual international number obtained through an application for over two years. He used this to register on various platforms, presenting himself as a successful model.His counterfeit profiles included fictional narratives and photographs for authenticity. After establishing connections, he persuaded victims to share intimate material.""Initially, he did this for amusement but later he turned it into a calculated scheme to extort money. He confessed to possessing the private content of numerous women and blackmailing several of them for financial gains,"" Vichitra Veer said in the statement.Bisht comes from a middle-class Shakarpur family. His father serves as a private driver, his mother manages the household, and his sister works in Gurugram.A BBA graduate, Bisht worked as a technical recruiter at a Noida-based organisation for three years.Police investigations revealed communications with over 60 women from Delhi and surrounding areas.

"Under new policy, Lieutenant Generals to be promoted on merit basis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-new-policy-lieutenant-generals-to-be-promoted-on-merit-basis/articleshow/116929166.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India moving towards the creation of tri-Service theatre commands, the Army has adopted a radical change in the promotion policy for top officers by making it necessary for all Lieutenant Generals to be graded on their performance through a “quantified assessment system”.This new system, which will come into force from March 31, will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex-level appointments in the integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments, sources told TOI.The new policy for Lt-Gens, with “revised annual confidential report (ACR) forms”, will not apply to the vice chief and commanders-in-chief of the six operational commands and one training command in the Army. These eight officers are also Lt-Gens but a rung higher than the other three-star generals.The over 11-lakh Army has almost 90 Lt-Gens, 300 Major Generals and 1,200 Brigadiers in its 43,000-strong officer cadre. “The new policy for Lt-Gens will align the Army with the much smaller IAF and Navy, where the quantified appraisal of equivalent ranks (Air Marshals and Vice Admirals) is already there,” a source said.“There was no quantified ACR system for Lt-Gens so far. Now, they will be graded on different attributes on a scale from 1 to 9. In effect, promotions will be based on merit rather than just seniority. The impending creation of theatre commands requires a uniform assessment system for the top ranks in all the three Services,” he added.The Army headquarters’ letter on the new policy does not specify whether it will also be applicable for the selection of the vice-chief and seven commanders-in-chief within the force.As per the existing Army policy, promotion to the C-in-C level is based purely on seniority, in conjunction with the date of birth and vacancies available. A Lt-Gen, after he has commanded one of the 14 corps in the force, must have `residual’ service of 18 months (till he turns 60) to be promoted as the C-in-C of one of the seven Army commands.Strong reservations against the new policy are already being expressed by some officers. “Very few officers become three-star generals after being assessed on merit at every step in their careers in the Army’s steeply-pyramidical structure,” a senior officer said.“After the Lt-Gen rank, promotion to C-in-C was based on seniority. Introducing merit at this stage will open the door for interference, political or otherwise,” he added.The policy comes at a time when the blueprint for the three theatre commands for China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean Region has been finalized to ensure an integrated war-fighting machinery. Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan has already made presentations to defence minister Rajnath Singh and national security advisor Ajit Doval on the matter.As per the existing plan, which entails the most radical military reorganization in the country since Independence, the China-specific northern theatre command will come up in Lucknow, while the western one for Pakistan will be based in Jaipur. The maritime theatre command, in turn, will be located at Thiruvananthapuram, as earlier reported by TOI.",New system will “facilitate merit-based selection” of serving Lt-Gens for apex- level appointments in integrated theatre commands and tri-Service establishments.

Gift deed can be quashed if kids neglect parents: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gift-deed-can-be-quashed-if-kids-neglect-parents-sc/articleshow/116926192.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emphasising need to protect interests of senior citizens, many of whom are ignored by their children and left to fend for themselves once they hand over property by executing a gift deed , Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act if the children fail to take care of them. The transfer of property would be declared null and void, court said.A bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Sanjay Karol said the Act is a beneficial legislation meant to lend a helping hand to elders who are left alone due to withering of joint family system and that its provisions should be interpreted liberally, and not in the strict sense, to protect their rights.It set aside a Madhya Pradesh HC verdict which held that gift deeds cannot be quashed on grounds of not serving parents if such conditions were not expressly mentioned in the deed. SC said HC took a 'strict view' of the legislation when a liberal view was needed to be taken to fulfil purpose of the law.Section 23 of the Act says, ""Where any senior citizen who, after the commencement of this Act, has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his property, subject to the condition that the transferee shall provide basic amenities and basic physical needs to the transferor and if such transferee refuses or fails to provide such amenities and physical needs, the said transfer of property shall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or under undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor be declared void by the tribunal.""Referring to this, HC had held that a gift deed should have a clause to the effect to bind children to take care of parents, and the deed cannot be quashed in absence of it. But SC overruled the verdict.The court allowed a woman's plea for quashing the gift deed in favour of her son who refused to take care of her. It relied on ""avachan patra/promissory note"" executed by her son promising to take care of her till the end of her life and that if he does not do so, she will be at liberty to take back the deed. The note was executed on the same day of execution of the gift deed.""The Act is a beneficial piece of legislation, aimed at securing rights of senior citizens, in view of the challenges faced by them. It is in this backdrop that the Act must be interpreted and a construction that advances remedies of the Act must be adopted,"" SC said.","Supreme Court held that such deeds signed by parents could be quashed under Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act.

New norms may put private chats out of probe agencies' reach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-norms-may-put-private-chats-out-of-probe-agencies-reach/articleshow/116950454.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union government is framing a common set of guidelines for the seizure and handling of documents, in digital or paper form, by investigative agencies in connection with their probes, amid indications that the focus is on devising ways to exclude personal chats and documents unrelated to alleged offences from the purview of probes.Supreme Court had recently put on hold recovery of all digital records, whether related or unrelated to alleged offence, from lottery king Santiago Martin's iPhone, which was seized by ED along with Rs 12 crore of unaccounted cash during a search on his premises in Nov. Martin had moved the apex court seeking to restrain the central agency from recovering digital records, arguing that his iPhone contained personal chats unrelated to the money laundering probe against him.Giving relief to Martin, SC bunched together hearing of his case with the one filed by Amazon, which is scheduled to be heard on Jan 6 when govt is likely to disclose the steps it has initiated on formulating guidelines on seizure of digital and other records during search and survey operations.The exclusion of personal conversations is expected to meet the concerns about the violation of privacy - something which has often been a ground in diverse jurisdictions to get the probes paused.Agencies contend that in the internet age, with criminals using electronic devices for transmitting messages and storing documents related to their unlawful activities, govt and court should not be losing sight of their operational requirements.Amazon, too, has challenged ED's demand for copies of all its emails with its vendors in connection with an ongoing probe related to foreign direct investments (FDI) in violation of FEMA rules. On Nov 7, ED had carried out searches at 19 premises in Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Panchkula at main vendors of Amazon and Flipkart in the FEMA violations case.The probe against the e-commerce giants is to ascertain whether they had engaged in predatory pricing through their preferred vendors, in violations of FDI rules, and directly or indirectly influenced the sale price of goods or services on their platforms, and not provided a level-playing field to other sellers.The agency had recovered a lot of documents from vendors of e-commerce giants, which prima facie revealed an alleged attempt to influence pricing of goods sold through preferred vendors. This evidence, sources said, would be corroborated with the communications the e-sellers had with their vendors.In Martin's case, SC had also stayed summons issued to him by the agency where the latter had asked him to join the probe to corroborate certain evidence seized during the Nov 14 searches on his premises in Chennai and Kolkata.An official with a probe agency said a detailed guideline issued by the govt and approved by SC may help agencies in time-bound completion of investigation and trial of cases as frequent challenges disrupt the proceedings.","Supreme Court had recently put on hold recovery of all digital records, whether related or unrelated to alleged offence, from lottery king Santiago Martin's iPhone.

""We are ready to do whatever we can as it involves a humanitarian issue,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iran-backed Houthi rebels remain in control of large parts of Yemen, including capital Sanaa.After the Yemen president last month upheld the death sentence of Nimisha, in jail since 2017, India said it was in touch with her family members and was extending all possible help to them in exploring legal options.Iran's offer of help came ahead of another round of foreign office consultations with India in which Tehran is expected to call for revival of trade ties, including resumption of oil supplies to India. Unlike with Iran, India has not just continued to import crude from Russia despite international sanctions but also ramped up Russian supplies.The official also spoke about bilateral ties with India and the need to explore opportunities to enhance trade ties, despite the sanctions Iran is facing. ""We don't want to impose any hardship on India but there are opportunities that can be explored. The nature of sanctions against Iran and Russia are different but it's still a legitimate question why India has continued to import energy from Russia but not Iran. We need to see how this issue can be addressed,"" said the official.Speaking about the conflict in Gaza and the overall West Asia situation, the official said Israel's military actions in Gaza had only worked to further ""internationalise'' the Palestine issue. ""The core issue is the occupation of Palestine and it must be addressed. We want to see an independent Palestine state. Nobody can erase it from the global agenda,"" said the official, who also backed stronger counter-terrorism cooperation with India in the context of recent developments in Syria.Also read: 'Last-min pardon' the hope for kin of nurse on Yemen death row","Iran is ready to take up the case of Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen for the murder of a Yemeni national.

The file was then sent to the PPSC for concurrence, as part of the laid-down procedure.The dismissal order on Thursday noted that the PPSC concurred with the proposal of the state govt on Dec 26 and granted approval to dismiss Sandhu from govt service under Article 311(2)(b) of the Constitution.The order pointed out that the proviso in question under the Article implemented in the present case as it was “not reasonably practicable” to hold an inquiry into the chargesheet issued to Gursher Singh Sandhu in view of the “non-cooperative attitude of the officer.”Referring to the inquiry by a special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the high court, the order said that Sandhu, who was under suspension since Oct 25, “facilitated the recording of an interview of Lawrence Bishnoi by a TV channel, while he was in the custody of CIA, Kharar.”The dismissal order noted that the Punjab DGP apprised that Sandhu “evaded all attempts to receive the chargesheet,” which had to be “affixed at the doorstep of his residence as a means of ensuring formal service in compliance with procedural requirements.”Two back-to-back TV interviews of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi were telecast by a channel in March 2023. The SIT headed by special DGP (Punjab State Human Rights Commission) Prabodh Kumar pointed out that while one interview was conducted when Bishnoi was in CIA, Kharar, the second interview was conducted in Rajasthan.Consequent to the SIT findings, seven police officials, including Sandhu, were suspended by the Punjab government.

'Chacha will be voted out'



NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Wednesday said he was ready to ""forgive and welcome"" Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to the opposition INDIA boc.""Our doors are open (for Nitish). He should also unbolt his gates. This would facilitate movement of people from both sides,"" Lalu Yadav said.Reacting to the RJD chief's remark, CM Nitish Kumar gave no affirmative response.""Kya bol rahe hain (What are you saying)"" was all the JD(U) boss said in response to queries from journalists about Prasad's fresh offer, according to news agency PTI.Meanwhile, former JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh ""Lalan"" snapped when asked about Lalu Yadav's remark.""The NDA is strong. JD(U) and BJP are united. It is a free society and anybody can say whatever he pleases. It is for Lalu ji to say more on his own utterances"", Lalan Singh said.Nitish Kumar, who ditched the INDIA bloc after spearheading its formation last year, joined the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.With the switch, though Nitish managed to remain the CM, RJD leader and Lalu's son Tejashwi Yadav had to step down as his deputy.Just hours after he resigned, the Janata Dal (United) chief took oath as the chief minister for a record ninth time.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also took a dig at Lalu Yadav, saying his ""dream will always remain dreams (Mungeri Lal ke Haseen Sapne hi rahenge). They will never be fulfilled.""Things seemed to fare smoothly for the NDA until the opposition got a shot in the arms after the Lok Sabha poll results.In the parliamentary election, BJP missed out on the majority numbers as it won only 240 seats, 32 less than the halfway mark.Whereas, the JDU won 12 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and emerged as a key ally in the NDA, positioning Nitish Kumar as a crucial player in the ruling alliance.The BJP-led NDA at the Centre majorly hinges on the JDU and Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, which won 16 seats for the ruling coalition to cross the majority figure of the 272 seats.If the table turns in Bihar, the INDIA bloc with 235 seats, would have a direct advantage of an additional 12 seats, an opportunity that the opposition has been eying since June 4 results.Unlike his father, Tejaswi Yadav was a little hard-hitting with his remark as he claimed that the new year will mark the ""departure"" of the CM Nitish-led NDA government in Bihar.Tejashwi Yadav, who is now leader of the opposition, was talking to reporters shortly after governor designate Arif Mohammad Khan left his house in Patna.""It is too cold. Keep yourselves warm but do not make any wild guesses. The new year will see a new harvest (nai fasal) and a new government that will be sensitive to the people's need for health, education and jobs (padhaai, kamaai, dawaai, sunwai aur karvaayi ki sarkaar),"" the RJD leader was quoted as saying by PTI.He added: ""In the new year, my uncle (chacha) Nitish Kumar will be voted out.

"Bernie Sanders criticizes Elon Musk over H-1B Visa program, Indian-American doctors, techies fire back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bernie-sanders-criticizes-elon-musk-over-h-1b-visa-program-indian-american-cardiologist-fires-back/articleshow/116898612.cms,"Senator Bernie Sanders publicly criticized Elon Musk's defense of the H-1B visa program.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has publicly criticized Elon Musk 's defense of the H-1B visa program , reigniting a debate over its impact on the US job market. In a statement released Thursday, Sanders took issue with Musk’s support for the foreign visa system, arguing that it enables companies to hire low-wage foreign workers instead of providing well-paying jobs for Americans.“Elon Musk is wrong,” Sanders wrote in a post on Musk's platform, X. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.”This bold assertion drew a sharp response from Anil, an Indian-American cardiologist trained at the Mayo Clinic, who shared his personal experience to counter Sanders' claims. “Senator, I am a cardiologist trained at Mayo Clinic. Without the H-1B visa, my path to US citizenship would have been impossible,” Anil wrote. “Before hiring me, my employer struggled for over a year to find a qualified, well-trained cardiologist to serve rural Kansas. I’d be happy to meet with you to provide a clearer picture of how the H-1B program supports underserved communities and strengthens our nation.”Another user wrote, “The H-1B program can indeed be misused, but it’s essential for addressing skill shortages in the US The real issue isn’t the program itself but ensuring fair wages and treatment for all workers.”Musk, who has long been a vocal supporter of the H-1B program, has argued that there is a shortage of skilled tech workers in the US and that foreign talent is necessary to fill the gaps. He has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump on the issue, with both men advocating for the hiring of individuals from countries like India to boost technological innovation in the US.Sanders, however, remained critical of Musk’s stance, citing recent layoffs at Tesla as evidence that the reliance on foreign guest workers may be harming American workers. “If there is really a shortage of skilled tech workers in America, why did Tesla lay off over 7,500 American workers this year— including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas—while being approved to employ thousands of H-1B guest workers?” Sanders questioned.The Vermont senator, known for his progressive views on labor rights, also used the debate to highlight his proposed minimum wage increase , which remains at $7.25 per hour. Sanders argued that the issue of foreign labor should not overshadow the need for higher wages for American workers. “Bottom line,” he wrote, “It should never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker.”While Sanders and Musk continue to spar over the future of the H-1B visa program, the debate has also drawn attention to the role of Indian professionals in the US labor force. Many Indian-American workers , especially in the tech and healthcare sectors, rely on the H-1B visa to pursue careers in the US and contribute to the economy.As the conversation around the H-1B visa intensifies, both sides of the debate remain at odds over the program's impact on American jobs and wages. For now, the question remains whether the program’s benefits to the US economy and underserved communities outweigh the concerns voiced by critics like Sanders.","Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has publicly criticized Elon Musk's defense of the H-1B visa program.
