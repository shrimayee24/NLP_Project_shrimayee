"Greenhouse gas levels surge and hit a new record in 2023, WMO warns of long-term global warming threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/greenhouse-gas-levels-surge-and-hit-a-new-record-in-2023-wmo-warns-of-long-term-global-warming-threat/articleshow/114713343.cms,"NEW DELHI: The year 2023 was not only the warmest on record but also witnessed another record-high surge in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, committing the planet to rising temperatures for many years to come, according to an annual bulletin of the World Meteorological Organisation released on Monday.It also cautioned that carbon dioxide (CO2) is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than at any time during human existence, having risen 11.4% in just 20 years. WMO said the last time the Earth experienced a comparable CO2 concentration of was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3 degree Celsius warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now.“Another year. Another record. This should set alarm bells ringing among decision makers. We are clearly off track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degree Celsius and aiming for 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.Noting that these are more than just statistics, she said, “Every part per million and every fraction of a degree temperature increase has a real impact on our lives and our planet.”The WMO bulletin, released ahead of the upcoming UN climate conference (COP29), shows that the globally-averaged surface concentration of CO2 reached 420 parts per million (ppm), methane 1,934 parts per billion, and nitrous oxide 336.9 parts per billion (ppb) in 2023. “These values are 151%, 265% and 125% of pre-industrial (before 1,750) levels,” it said, noting that these are calculated on the basis of the long-term observations within the Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations.According to the bulletin that reports on GHG concentrations rather than on emission levels, the CO2 level has increased 11.4 % (42.9 ppm) above the level of 377.1 ppm recorded in 2004. CO2 is the single most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, accounting for approximately 64% of the warming effect on the climate.The long-term CO2 increase is mainly due to fossil fuel combustion but there are year-to-year variations due to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The surge in 2023 was also contributed by El Nino — a climate pattern associated with unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean — as during such years drier vegetation and forest fires reduce the efficiency of land carbon sink.Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas which remains in the atmosphere for about a decade, on the other hand, accounts for about 16% of the warming effect of long-lived GHG. The third one, nitrous oxide, is both a powerful GHG and ozone depleting chemical, accounting for about 6% of the radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases with the remaining 14% being contributed by other polluting gases.","The year 2023 was not only the warmest on record but also witnessed another record-high surge in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable CO2 concentration of was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3 degree Celsius warmer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114713420,imgsize-1660001,width-400,resizemode-4/114713420.jpg"
Census 2021 to resume in 2025: Digital implementations and major changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-2021-to-resume-in-2025-digital-implementations-and-major-changes/articleshow/114712233.cms,"The process of conducting Census 2021 , on hold since 2020, could begin in 2025, sources told TOI on Monday. The population figures to be thrown up by the much-delayed and keenly-awaited census will form the basis for delimitation of parliamentary and assembly constituencies — due after 2026 and which will also involve earmarking seats to be reserved for women, besides Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes — likely to follow in 2027-28.If the decadal pattern of previous census exercises is retained, the next census cycles may fall due in 2035, 2045 and so on. Sources, however, said there is no clarity yet on conducting a caste census — a demand made by allies like JD(U) and TDP as well as the opposition parties — possibly by adding a ‘caste’ field in the houselisting schedule.The Census 2021 houselisting schedule, notified in January 2020, comprises 31 fields sans ‘caste’.Though sources had earlier indicated that a decision on census was expected shortly, the schedule for National Population Register (NPR) updation, which was to be done alongside the first stage of Census — houselisting and housing operations — has not been notified yet. Even the schedule for the second stage of Census 2021 — the population enumeration phase — has not been notified.The 84th amendment to the Constitution of India had placed a freeze on delimitation of parliamentary and assembly seats until 2026, apart from requiring the next delimitation process to be done based on figures of the first census to be undertaken after 2026. A census beginning in 2025, which will put out the population figures in March 2026, may not fulfil this criteria for fresh delimitation, unless the 84thamendment is revisited, a former officer at the Office of Registrar General of India (ORGI) told TOI.The deadline for freezing the boundaries of administrative units like districts, tehsils, villages etc — a mandatory procedure prior to start of census — was repeatedly extended after Census 2021 exercise, due to begin in April 2020, was deferred due to Covid outbreak. However, no extension order was issued after June 30, 2024.Usually, the preparatory process for census — which comprises houselisting and housing phase, usually undertaken between April 1 and September 30, followed by the population enumeration phase taken up in February of the following year — begins with a pre-test in the year preceding the start of census. This pre-test for Census 2021 was conducted in August-September 2019.“The census process has undergone major a technical updation since...the next census will be the first digital census and will allow respondents to self-enumerate at both the houselisting and the population enumeration stage. All replies to the census questionnaire will be uploaded on the dedicated Census portal,” said an officer. A source told TOI that the Census portal is still being readied. “Since the processes have undergone a technical overhaul, the requirement for a fresh pre-test may be considered, even though the app and the software are being tested internally. The enumerators need to be well versed with the new processes and the census app,” said an former Census officer.","Census 2021 exercise, due to begin in April 2020, was deferred due to Covid outbreak.

The air quality improved marginally to ‘poor’ by 6pm, with an AQI of 299, as winds picked up. However, it’s likely to remain ‘very poor’ over the next few days and may turn ‘severe’ on Diwali.Wind direction on Monday was south-easterly, but the met department’s forecast shows it is likely to change to north-westerly on Diwali. North-westerly winds are favourable for transport of smoke from stubble burning sites to Delhi.Experts said winds turn calm during the night time, causing accumulation of pollutants, while light winds prevail during the daytime. However, on Monday, wind speed increased, leading to dispersion of pollutants.“Winds play an important role in dispersion of pollutants in the absence of any significant weather activity like rain, which washes them out. The average wind speed during the daytime on Monday was 15-18 kmph,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice chairman, Skymet Meteorology.The air quality is likely to stay ‘very poor’ till Wednesday and may turn ‘severe’ on Diwali if there are added emissions from firecrackers and stubble burning. “The outlook for the subsequent six days from Thursday is that the air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category,” said the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences.CAQM, which reviewed the air quality in NCR Friday, directed Delhi govt and NCR states to ensure strict implementation of the SC order on firecrackers and their respective regulations. It directed agencies to work in coordination to ensure AQI levels don’t compel the necessity to invoke further stages of GRAP.“NCR states and Delhi govt were directed to augment the capacity and intensify the use of mechanised road sweeping and sprinkling of water, identify more highrises for installation of anti-smog guns, and deploy nodal officers to address air pollution from hotspots. The strict implementation of SC orders and orders on firecrackers was highlighted, in view that festivals this year coincide with the peak paddy harvesting season in northern India,” CAQM said Monday.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature stood at 34.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal while the minimum settled at 20.4 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.","The air quality improved marginally to ‘poor’ by 6pm, with an AQI of 299.

Nifty50 was at 24,465.05, up 284.25 points or 1.18 per cent.Indian stock markets have broken a five-day losing streak amidst persistent foreign selling and disappointing quarterly corporate results. ICICI Bank led the gains, surpassing profit expectations for the September quarter due to strong loan demand.ICICI Bank, SBI, NTPC, Infosys, Bajaj Finserv, and Tata Motors were the top gainers in the Sensex pack, rising by up to 2.7 per cent. On the other hand, L&T, ITC, Tech Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, and JSW Steel opened lower.IDFC First Bank's shares dropped 10 per cent after reporting a 73 per cent year-on-year decline in profit, falling to Rs 201 crore for the quarter ended September 2024. DLF shares, however, jumped over 4per cent after the real estate developer reported higher second-quarter profit driven by sales of newly launched houses.The Nifty PSU Bank index rose 2 per cent, led by Bank of Baroda, SBI, and PNB. The Nifty Financial Services, IT, Media, and Metal indices also opened higher. The Nifty mid and small-cap indices opened flat in the broader markets.The Nifty 50 has fallen nearly 8per cent from its all-time high on September 27, weighed down by foreign outflows over the past 20 sessions, as investors shift funds to China due to Beijing's stimulus measures and relatively lower valuations.Analysts noted that weak earnings have also negatively impacted investor sentiment and contributed to the selling pressure, in addition to foreign selling.Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, stated, ""The trend of flight to quality is likely to sustain given the good numbers from banking majors like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank where valuations continue to be fair. Investors can profit from these polarised valuations.""""The global market structure may turn favourable after the subdued Israeli strikes against Iran avoiding the Iranian oil fields which has resulted in a sharp drop in crude prices.

This is a slight improvement from Sunday's AQI of 356.The Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) reported that the AQI at Anand Vihar was 357 at 7am, which is in the 'very poor' category but a drop from 405 recorded on Sunday. The AQI near the Akshardham temple was 357, worse than yesterday's 261 at 7am.SAFAR predicts that even with the firecracker ban in effect until January 1, air quality is likely to remain 'Very Poor' due to firecrackers and stubble burning. ""The meteorological conditions are unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants,"" stated SAFAR.Vansh Aggarwal, a student in Delhi, called for the government to use ""new techniques and innovation"" to tackle pollution. ""There are many reasons for the increase in pollution including vehicle and industrial pollution. Even though it is said that it is increasing due to Diwali, but there are a lot of reasons for it, it would be wrong to attribute it to just Diwali. There should be a proper system to tackle the issue of pollution,"" he said.Another resident, Sukhram, described having health issues due to pollution. ""There is a lot of pollution here in Delhi, for the last 7 days I have been sick.

Regional maintenance hub: The deal also includes plans for setting up Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facilities in India, positioning the country as a regional hub for servicing not just its own fleet but potentially those of other nations as well.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a major shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol.

Russia is getting Nvidia AI chips from an Indian pharma company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-is-getting-nvidia-ai-chips-mumbai-drugmaker-putin-shreya-life-sciences-importgenius/articleshow/114672764.cms,"Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India.



BRICS Leader's Summit In Kazan

Occupying the top three floors of an unremarkable office building in northern Mumbai, there’s little to distinguish Shreya Life Sciences from the many other commercial businesses that keep the Andheri neighborhood of India’s largest metropolis humming throughout the day.But this inconspicuous pharmaceutical company is part of a lucrative trade in leading-edge technology to Russia that has the US and its European allies worried at India’s burgeoning role as an intermediary in the sales.A Bloomberg News analysis of data compiled by trade-tracking firms ImportGenius and NBD shows that Shreya exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most-advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.The servers, known as PowerEdge XE9680, contain high-end processors optimized for artificial intelligence made by Nvidia Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc, according to Dell’s website. Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia’s H100 chips.The servers — and the chips they contain — are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union “to target sensitive sectors in Russia’s military industrial complex.” Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed.Shreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office.The findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow’s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It’s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported October 12.Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. “No one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,” he said October 7.While India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the “enormous potential” to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies.Shipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to an email seeking comments.The tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains “a strict trade compliance program.” Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in “full compliance” with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified.Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war — and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an October 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to “our close and deepening” relations.That role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia’s war.US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia’s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration’s efforts to keep Modi’s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said.Transshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O’Sullivan, the EU’s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to “the huge volume of rupees” Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India.India has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government’s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list.A spokesperson for India’s Trade Ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment.India’s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them.Information on those companies involved is rare — and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out.The company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company’s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya.In an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya’s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when “after the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.” He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would “impart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.”Records from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports.That dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin’s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses.The drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers — including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. — restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court.Shreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank’s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions.Between 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary.Later, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.Meantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be “not of standard quality” most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata.It’s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments.The first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month.Shreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities.Main Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it “imports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.” An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered.Shreya’s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield.Shipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd, a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary.Dell said it requires distributors and resellers “to follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,” and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. “If a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,” the company said.Main Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022.Hayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences. A discrete plaque at the top floor of Shreya’s offices bears the name, Hayers Infotech Pvt Ltd.","Shreya Life Sciences exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most- advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year. The shipments, worth $300 million, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114672849,imgsize-99996,width-400,resizemode-4/114672849.jpg"

US sends back a planeload of illegal Indian immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-a-planeload-of-illegal-indian-immigrants/articleshow/114633377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States earlier this week sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States. This shows the “department’s continued commitment to pursuing sustained cooperation with the Indian govt and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling”, it said in a press release. DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.","U.S. sent back a plane loaded with illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security.

The ECI or the concerned DM, who has interpreted the submission, as convenient.""""If information in public domain is not mentioned and the nomination paper is still accepted, then what is the purpose of scrutiny?"" he added.Earlier, the BJP had claimed that Priyanka failed to fully disclose information about her and her husband Robert Vadra's assets in the affidavit submitted for the Lok Sabha bypoll in Wayanad. BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia had asserted that her actions violate the Supreme Court's mandate for poll candidates to provide complete details of their own assets, as well as those of their spouse and dependents.Bhatia highlighted the alleged acquisition of National Herald assets by the Gandhi family, pointing out that Priyanka Gandhi's affidavit failed to disclose her ownership of shares in Associated Journals through various trusts.

Tata-Airbus C-295: Top features of India’s first privately built military aircraft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tata-airbus-c-295-top-features-of-indias-first-privately-built-aircraft/articleshow/114683994.cms,"Aircraft C-295

Here's all you need to know about C-295 aircraft

The C-295's design focuses on reducing weight and lowering maintenance and operational costs, making it easy to maintain and operate. This results in the aircraft achieving the highest availability rate in its category.

The C-295 is a highly adaptable, multi-role tactical airlifter , ideal for various operations, including logistics, rescue, and support missions. Its range of features allows it to perform efficiently across diverse scenarios, showcasing both versatility and reliability.

The name ""C-295"" reflects key aspects of the aircraft: ""C"" represents CASA, the original manufacturer; ""2"" denotes its two engines, and ""95"" signifies a payload capacity of 9.5 tonnes. This naming convention highlights its design and performance capabilities as outlined by Airbus.

The C-295 features a more powerful Pratt and Whitney Canada PW100 engine, delivering 2,645 hp. It also boasts a new propeller and a redesigned wing, enhancing its performance compared to its predecessor.

The C-295 is a combat-proven aircraft that has been effectively utilised in long deployments of up to two years, flying as much as 100 hours per month.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada.

"US, France & Armenia top three buyers of Indian defence exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-france-armenia-top-three-buyers-of-indian-defence-exports/articleshow/114666748.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India shedding its hesitations in exporting lethal arms to other countries, Armenia has emerged as its biggest client of ‘finished’ weapon systems like Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems and 155mm artillery guns, among others.The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India, which chalked up military sales worth Rs 21,083 crore ($2.6 billion) to other countries in 2023-24, official sources said on Sunday.Indian public and private sector companies are now exporting a wide range of arms, ammunition and fuses to around 100 countries, which also include some complete weapon systems and platforms like BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Dornier-228 aircraft, artillery guns, radars, Akash missiles , Pinaka rockets, and armoured vehicles, the sources added.The exports to the US, however, mainly consist of sub-systems and components, which include global defence majors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin sourcing fuselage, wings, and other parts of aircraft and helicopters from India as part of their global supply chain networks as well as offset commitments.The Tata Boeing Aerospace venture in Hyderabad, for instance, is making the fuselage and secondary structures for Apache attack helicopters. “France, in turn, is importing a lot of software and electronic equipment,” a source said.The former Soviet Republic of Armenia, on its part, has inked a flurry of deals with India over the last four years for import of ‘finished products’ like missiles, artillery guns, rocket systems, weapon-locating radars, bullet-proof vests, and night-vision equipment as well as a wide variety of ammunition and artillery shells. Some of these deals were inked even during Armenia’s clash with Azerbaijan — which has close ties with Turkey and Pakistan — over Nagorno-Karabakh, as reported by TOI earlier.Armenia has become the first foreign customer for the indigenously-developed Akash air defence missiles, which have an interception range of 25 km, while other countries like Brazil are even keen on co-production and co-development of advanced versions of the system. “Brazil wants an inter-governmental agreement on it…talks are underway,” another source said.Similarly, after India clinched the $375-million contract in Jan 2022 for the export of three BrahMos anti-ship coastal missile batteries to the Philippines, other Asean countries as well as some Gulf nations are increasingly showing interest in acquiring the precision-strike missiles that India has co-developed with Russia.India, of course, continues to remain in the strategically-vulnerable position of being the world’s largest arms importer, accounting for 9.8% of the total global imports in the 2019-2023 time-frame.The country, however, is now progressively expanding its domestic defence-industrial base (DIB) and banning import of some weapon systems under the drive for ‘Aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) or ‘Make in India’, while aggressively pushing arms exports.With India’s annual defence production reaching a record high of Rs 1.2 lakh crore in 2023-24, the govt has set an ambitious target for it to touch Rs 3 lakh crore by 2028-29, along with arms exports of Rs 50,000 crore.India’s defence-industrial base, apart from the 16 defence PSUs, has now expanded to over 430 licenced companies and 16,000 MSMEs, with around three times increase in value of production since 2014-15. The private sector’s contribution amounts to 21% in this, the official sources said.","The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India. India chalked up military sales worth Rs 21,083 crore ($2.6 billion) to other countries in 2023-24.

Union Bank of India, the complainant in the case, has demanded Rs 11,000 crore dues from the accused, alleging that the loans taken by them were laundered through shell entities.The latest attachment includes bank deposits, mutual funds, shares, various landed properties and buildings acquired in the name of shell companies, apart from that of Corporate Power Ltd and the family members of Manoj Jayaswal and others, ED said.The money laundering probe was initiated by the agency based on an FIR registered by the CBI against Corporate Power Ltd and its promoters alleging criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery.Union Bank of India had alleged that the accused had submitted manipulated project cost statements to avail loans and also diverted bank funds, causing wrongful loss to the tune of Rs 4,037 crore. The bank has claimed an outstanding of Rs 11,379 crore, including interest.The agency had further claimed that the accused had laundered the proceeds of crime using at least 250 shell companies and more than 20 charitable organisations registered for the purpose.“The promoters had engaged in fictitious transactions and fabrication of the accounts of the company and its related entities.

Assets were accumulated from the proceeds of crime in the form of movable assets like listed and unlisted shares, loans and advances, mutual funds, FDs and immovable properties,” ED claimed.","The Enforcement Directorate ( ED) has attached assets worth Rs 500 crore in a Rs 4,000-crore bank fraud and money laundering case.

Those entrusted with protecting common people and their investments had abrogated their responsibilities and were indulging in widescale corruption and malpractice, Gandhi alleged. In the video, Khera is seen explaining to Gandhi the conflicts of interest allegations against Buch and how there were powers behind her that were at work, an apparent reference to the Adani Group.Sharing the video, the party said the role of the Sebi chairperson was to maintain the security of the stock market and to ensure that investments of common Indians were not at risk. However, when the chairperson was involved in manipulating the market to benefit a single player, like the Adani Group, everyone's money was at risk, it said.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Rahul Gandhi wrote, ""What was Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch taking money from ICICI for?""

Not a single witness was examined in the enquiry, the HC pointed out.Yadav was a BDA revenue officer in 2015 when he was accused of making some changes to the lease deed of a piece of land at ISBT-Bhopal which caused financial loss to BDA.

Yadav replied to the notice and moved HC, challenging the action against him.HC asked Yadav to approach the BDA appellate authority, which upheld the order to sack him without giving him a hearing, his petition stated. After hearing both sides, Justice Dwivedi cited an HC order stating: ""The doctrine of proportionality exists in India from time immemorial. It is applied by courts in criminal cases on a regular basis. The principle is that one cannot be visited with an extreme order/punishment which is not commensurate with the conduct/misconduct /offence.""Citing an SC order, the HC said that getting a copy of the enquiry report is the right of the delinquent when the enquiry officer is not the disciplinary authority, but in this case, the petitioner was neither given the enquiry report nor told why.

The stringent provisions will have to be interpreted with due regard to Article 21, and in case of a conflict, the stringent provisions, such as Section 45 of PMLA in the instant case, will have to give way,” said the court.The court made the remark while granting bail to two former Bhushan Steel Limited (BSL) officials, Pankaj Kumar Tewari and Pankaj Kumar – vice-presidents in finance and accounts departments of BSL, respectively – who were booked in connection with a Rs 46,000-crore money laundering case. The two officials have been accused of aiding the ex-promoters of BSL, the main accused, in the case.The two got bail after over nine months in jail. The court took note of the fact that the main accused and similarly placed co-accused had already been given bail.Observing that the case involved numerous defendants, extensive evidence spanning lakhs of pages and many witnesses, due to which the trial was unlikely to conclude anytime soon for no fault of the accused, the court said: “When there are multiple accused persons, lakhs of pages of evidence to assess (and) scores of witnesses to be examined, the trial is not expected to end anytime in the near future. Importantly, the delay being not attributable to the accused, keeping the accused in custody by using Section 45 PMLA as a tool for incarceration is not permissible. The flow of liberty cannot be dammed by Section 45 without taking all other germane considerations into account. It is the duty of constitutional courts to champion the constitutional cause of liberty and uphold the majesty of Article 21.”“Constitutional courts can always exercise their powers to grant bail on the grounds of violation of Part III of Constitution of India, and stringent provisions for the grant of bail, such as those provided in Section 45 of the PMLA, do not take away the power of constitutional courts to do so,” said the court.The court reiterated that “bail is the rule and jail is the exception” in view of Article 21, adding, “Liberty is the usual course of action, and deprivation of it a detour, which is why there are safeguards imposed to ensure that the deprivation of liberty is only by procedure established by law.”","Delhi high court ruled that stringent twin tests for grant of bail cannot be invoked as a tool to indefinitely detain accused persons.

Bambiha syndicate is the newest entrant in Delhi’s crowded crime landscape,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bambiha-syndicate-is-the-newest-entrant-in-delhis-crowded-crime-landscape/articleshow/114705237.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi cops are on their toes with the initial investigation into a firing incident at a businessman’s house in northwest Delhi’s Rani Bagh pointing towards the possible involvement of the Bambiha syndicate . This marks a third entrant into Delhi’s mafiadom, which is already plagued by the Lawrence Bishnoi and Himanshu Bhau gangs.While Bishnoi managed to gun down businessman Nadir Shah in an area like Greater Kailash-I, Bhau has been cocking a snook at Delhi cops with incidents like a murder in a crowded Burger King restaurant and multiple shooting incidents at car showrooms in the capital.The Bambihas are arch-rivals of Lawrence Bishnoi. Bishnoi, it is believed, decided to kill Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala after he released a song titled ‘Bambiha Bole’, a cop who interrogated Bishnoi last year recalled.The leadership of the Bambihas is scattered after its kingpin, Davinder Bambiha, was killed in an encounter with police in 2016. While jailed gangster Kaushal Chaudhary has been overseeing the affairs of the gang along with his associates Amit Dagar, Fateh Nagri and others, fugitive Gaurav, alias Lucky Patial, is heading the group from the US or Armenia. Until now, the group was active in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.Police are particularly alarmed by the development because of the close association of the Bambihas with pro-Khalistan factions, including Khalistan Tiger Force. After the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, KTF’s new chief, Arsh Dala, has been working closely with the Bambihas. In 2022, Dala orchestrated the murder of a Hindu man in Delhi as a ‘test task’ for his two henchmen — Naushad and Jagga — who wanted to make it big.A dossier on the Bambihas says that while terrorising people through extortion, intimidation and killings, the group has subsequently associated with Pro-Khalistani elements and extremists. “Despite being apprehended under organised crime acts like MCOCA and jailed, most of these gangsters flourished while operating from behind bars. While in jail, they transformed into militants and created a deadly terror-criminal nexus, which is not only susceptible to exploitation by external forces inimical to India but also dangerous to national security,” reads the dossier.According to a chargesheet filed by National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Bambiha group and its affiliate gangs have wreaked havoc in north India with sensational killings. “They have murdered kabaddi players, political functionaries, etc in a bid to increase their influence. They terrorise people and carry out extortion from businessmen, singers, etc. They committed the murder of Jitender Gogi before a judicial officer in the Rohini Court complex,” says the document.“These incidents are similar to executions carried out by the underworld in the 1990s, which included the murder of Gulshan Kumar, owner of T-Series, the killing of Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East-West Airlines, and the murder of Datta Samant….” says the chargesheet.",The Bambihas are arch-rivals of Lawrence Bishnoi and Himanshu Bhau.

Though it can help resolve family and financial issues, it can’t issue divorce certificates or enforce penalties.Justice G R Swaminathan criticised the divorce certificate, describing it as “shocking”.He said the council had accepted the husband’s petition for triple talaq and attempted to mediate, but blamed the wife for not cooperating.“Only courts duly constituted by the state can deliver judgments. Shariat Council is a private body and not a court,” the judge reiterated, dismissing the husband’s revision petition. “So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist.”In 2018, the wife disputed the divorce and filed a petition under the Protection of Women from Domestic ViolenceAct before a Tirunelveli judicial magistrate court. She also asserted that the third talaq was not served on her, meaning the marriage was still valid. The husband married a second time that year.In 2021, the magistrate ruled in favour of the first wife, directing the husband to pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation for domestic violence and Rs 25,000 a month for the maintenance of their minor child. Later, a sessions court dismissed the husband’s appeal against this decision, prompting him to file the current revision petition before the HC.During the hearing, Justice Swaminathan said the husband claimed to have properly pronounced talaq three times. “If it is disputed by the wife, the question arises if the marriage has been validly dissolved. So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist,” the judge observed.The HC said the husband must go to the court and obtain a declaration. “The issue cannot be left to the unilateral determination of the husband since that would amount to the husband becoming a judge of his own cause,” the judge observed.The judge said the act of bigamy caused “considerable emotional distress and pain” to the wife, amounting to cruelty.“If a Hindu, Christian, Parsi, or Jewish husband contracts a second marriage during the subsistence of the first marriage, it would constitute cruelty besides being an offence of bigamy. It would obviously be considered an act of domestic violence entitling the wife to claim compensation under Section 12 of the Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Will this proposition apply in the case of Muslims? The answer is yes,” Justice Swaminathan said.","Madurai bench of Madras HC ruled while hearing a civil revision petition regarding the triple talaq of a Muslim doctor couple who married in 2010.

What the government is doing

Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned the nation about the rise in digital arrest scams during his recent Mann ki Baat address. In a shocking revelation, Indians lost Rs 120.3 crore in the digital arrest fraud during the first quarter of 2024. According to the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) data, around 7.4 lakh cybercrime complaints were received in the Q1, 2024. 46% of these digital frauds included digital arrests, trading scams, investment scams (task based) and romance/dating scams.According to an Indian Express report that quoted Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Kumar, victims lost a cumulative amount of Rs 1,776 crore to these scams. Victims lost Rs 1,420.48 crore in trading scams, Rs 222.58 crore in investment scams, and Rs 13.23 crore in romance/dating scams.Fraudsters involved in these scams were based in Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.Detailing the modus operandi of digital arrest scam during the 115th episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, PM Narendra Modi explained how fraudsters carry out the. He said that no government agency threatens individuals over the phone or demands money. Anyone who receives such a call, he said needn’t be afraid. “Be aware that no investigating agency conducts such interrogations over the phone or video call. The three steps to digital security are: stop, think and act,” he stated.“As soon as you get a call, stop... don't panic, stay calm, don't take any hasty steps, don't give away your personal information to anyone; if possible take a screenshot and record it for sure,” he added.“The first step is 'stop' and the second step is 'think'. No government agency threatens you on the phone like this, neither inquires nor demands money on a video call like this,"" Modi said.The third step, PM Modi said, is 'take action', urging victims to dial the national cyber helpline 1930 and report such incidents on cybercrime.gov.in.During the episode, PM Modi also shared a conversation between a victim and a fraudster to highlight the ‘digital arrest’ scam. He said “The fraudsters of digital arrest phone calls, at times impersonate as police, CBI, narcotics, at times RBI... using such various labels, they converse as fake officers with a lot of confidence. Many listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' have wished that we must discuss that”.During the broadcast, the PM said that thousands of such fraudulent video-calling IDs have been blocked by the agencies along with lakhs of SIM cards, mobile phones and bank accounts. He said “Agencies are doing their job, but for protection from scams in the name of digital arrest, it is very important that everyone is aware, every citizen is aware. Those who are victims of this kind of cyber fraud should let as many people as possible know about it. You can use #SafeDigitalIndia for awareness.” PM Modi urged schools and colleges to involve students in the campaign against cyber scams.

‘Destination Goa’ makes it easy to lure victims into sex trade in state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/destination-goa-makes-it-easy-to-lure-victims-into-sex-trade-in-state/articleshow/114703244.cms,"Panaji:

Goa’s status as a popular tourist destination has made it easier for trafficked victims to obtain permission from their families to travel to the coastal state.Family members of the victims often believed that their loved ones were simply going on a vacation. “Goa is becoming a destination for sex trafficking also because demand is high and the payment and working conditions are good.The trafficked victims could more easily get permission to come to Goa as it is a tourist place, and the family members felt that the victim is going for a holiday,” said NGO Arz (Anyay Rahit Zindagi), the nodal agency for Goa police to rescue victims of commercial sexual exploitation (CSE).In most cases, the victims were the primary breadwinners for their families of three or four members, managing their households on modest incomes of Rs 15,000 to 25,000. However, during the pandemic, they were without jobs for over a year and were forced to take loans. Even after returning to work, they struggled to repay these loans and support their families, with their post-pandemic salaries almost halved compared to pre-pandemic levels. The traffickers exploited their vulnerability, luring them with promises of high-paying jobs , only to force them into the sex trade.In some cases, the victims were initially forced into the sex trade in Goa. Later, they developed relationships with individuals in the sex market, including sex buyers, hotel staff, taxi drivers and others in the trade. Once released by their pimps, these relationships ensured their continuation in the sex trade. “In some instances, the victims’ partners were found to be directly involved in trafficking or profited from their earnings,” ARZ director Arun Pandey said.Victims were married off as children were unable to complete their education or receive any skill training that would enable them to secure a job to support their families.Divorced, separated, or widowed women, especially those without support from their in-laws or maternal family, were highly vulnerable to trafficking. “In some cases, the victims had love marriages against their parents’ wishes and had run away from home,” Pandey said.The advancement of social media sites, along with apps for flight, hotel and internal travel bookings has made it easier for pimps to maintain secrecy, Pandey said. Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Nepal, and Bangladesh remain major source areas. Uttar Pradesh for internal trafficking and Kenya, Uganda for cross-border trafficking are new sources.","Goa's status as a popular tourist destination has made it easier for trafficked victims to obtain permission from their families to travel to the coastal state.

The flight reached a substantial height.”“In second approach, the flight was very close to the runway surface, but again rejected the landing. Finally, in the third approach, the aircraft made a smooth landing. The anxiety level among the passengers was such that a woman sitting on the 21 E seat vomited and I and another passenger gave her our air sickness pouches, while I began reciting ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ after second failed attempt to land,” said Mishra, who has been a frequent flyer for the last 32 years.Official sources corroborated Mishra’s version.“First and second approach was from the west side (runway 09 side), but the third approach was from east (runway 27 side) where Instrument Landing System (ILS) is available to guide aircraft digitally, and the aircraft landed.”It’s important to note that landing of an aircraft is decided by Air Traffic Control considering various factors including wind direction.Aircraft makes an ideal landing opposite to strong wind flow.“Since the wind from the east was strong, the flight was asked to land from the West side. But it was very ‘unusual’ to see the pilot fail to land on two approaches. Therefore, pilots were asked to take the east side approach. DGCA has been informed about the landing in three approaches,” the source added.Considering the sensitivity of the landing call, fire tenders were asked to remain on standby mode.Attempts were made to contact the airline, as to why the aircraft failed to land on the second approach. However, no response was received.Before landing around 2 pm, the Airbus A321 aircraft had started its daily routine operation in the wee hour from New Delhi for Vijayawada and vice versa. The crew of the aircraft continued its regular flight and departed Lucknow around 3 pm for New Delhi, and from there it ferried passengers to Ahmedabad, came back, and then took off for Amritsar. It finally landed back in Delhi post midnight.","Flight from Delhi to Lucknow with 202, including four infants, onboard made a landing on its third approach at Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport on Monday afternoon.

Bargain hunting reverses sensex's five-session slide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bargain-hunting-reverses-sensexs-five-session-slide/articleshow/114704466.cms,"MUMBAI: Bargain hunting on Dalal Street after the sensex slid for five days lifted it by 603 points or 0.8% to 80,005 points on Monday. While ICICI Bank led the rally on the back of a strong set of quarterly numbers, foreign fund selling late in the session limited gains after the index was up more than 1,100 points during mid-session.Restricted air strikes by Israel over the weekend on select military installations in Iran also prompted global investors to speculate about non-escalation of hostilities between the two West Asian nations. This, in turn, led to a slide in the prices of crude oil - the biggest import item for India - which helped the rupee strengthen a bit. Crude price on the NYMEX tanked nearly 6% in early trades on Monday, while the rupee ended 5 paise up at 84.05 against the dollar.On the NSE, too, Nifty rallied strongly and closed 158 points or 0.7% up at 24,339 points.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Is it safe to eat at McDonald’s? Sales slump after E. Coli outbreak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-it-safe-to-eat-at-mcdonalds-sales-slump-after-e-coli-outbreak/articleshow/114711652.cms,"McDonald’s has tried to reassure customers that it’s safe to eat at its restaurants.

McDonald’s Corp sales plummeted following news of E. coli infections linked to the chain’s Quarter Pounders .Transactions fell as much as 6% from the prior year in the days after the outbreak became public on Tuesday, dragging down total sales, according to Bloomberg Second Measure data through October 25. The group tracks debit and credit card transactions from US consumers.The outbreak dealt a blow to McDonald’s, which had been working to reverse slumping traffic with offers such as a $5 meal deal and a splashy marketing campaign behind the limited-time Chicken Big Mac. McDonald’s transactions had been growing in the weeks before the issue was disclosed, Second Measure data shows.McDonald’s has tried to reassure customers that it’s safe to eat at its restaurants. In a message Sunday, Joe Erlinger, the chain’s US president, apologized to customers.“I know that our relationship is built on trust. You trust us to serve you safe food every time,” he said in a video. “On behalf of the McDonald’s system, I want you to hear from me: we are sorry.”McDonald’s has said it suspects that raw slivered onions that garnish the Quarter Pounder are the carriers of the pathogen. The chain, which had pulled the burgers from about 20% of its more than 13,000 US locations, said Sunday it planned to bring them back this week after ruling out beef as the source of the contamination. They’ll be served without onions at those restaurants.Traffic fell across the US, but states where the burgers were pulled reported even larger declines, according to an analysis of Placer.ai cellphone mobility data by Gordon Haskett. Colorado, which has recorded the largest number of cases, had a 33% decline on October 25 from the prior year.The outbreak has sickened 75 people across 13 states and caused one death, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. The CDC said it believes the risk to the public is “very low,” citing actions taken by McDonald’s and the onion supplier, Taylor Farms, which recalled several batches of the product. McDonald’s said it would stop buying onions from the facility that’s become the focus of the investigation.","Transactions fell as much as 6% from the prior year in the days after the outbreak became public on Tuesday.

The former palace of Bangladesh's ex-leader Sheikh Hasina will be converted into a museum to commemorate the revolution that led to her removal, according to the country's current caretaker government leader, Muhammad Yunus Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, made this announcement during his tour of the Ganabhaban palace , which used to be the prime minister's official residence. ""The museum should preserve memories of her misrule and the people's anger when they removed her from power,"" Yunus said.Sheikh Hasina, who ruled for 15 years, was ousted on August 5 following a student-led uprising. She fled to India via helicopter. Her tenure was marked by human rights abuses, including mass detention and extrajudicial killings. A Bangladeshi court has issued an arrest warrant for her.Prior to Hasina's downfall, over 700 individuals were killed, many in a brutal police crackdown. As she fled, thousands stormed her former residence, which the government described as a ""symbol of repression.""The palace, now damaged and marked with graffiti against her regime, will feature a replica of the ""House of Mirrors"" Aynaghar detention center, which was notorious under her rule. ""The Aynaghar should remind visitors of the torture endured by secret prisoners,"" Yunus added.The uprising also led to significant unrest, including the looting of a museum at the home of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was Bangladesh's first president.Construction of the museum is expected to start by December, according to Apurba Jahangir, a press official in Yunus's office. ""The museum construction hasn’t begun yet, but it will start soon,"" Apurba told AFP.Sheikh Hasina, 77, has not been seen in public since fleeing to India, with her last known location being a military airbase near New Delhi.","Bangladesh's former PM's palace to be converted into a museum.

Tommy Robinson Jailed: British Far-Right Activist Violates Court Injunction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-far-right-activist-tommy-robinson-jailed-for-violating-injunction/articleshow/114696016.cms,"(With input from agencies)

Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a British anti-Muslim activist also known as Tommy Robinson , was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Monday after pleading guilty to contempt of court for violating an injunction issued after a successful libel lawsuit against him.In 2021, Jamal Hijazi , a Syrian refugee, filed a libel lawsuit against Robinson in London's High Court and was awarded 100,000 British pounds ($130,000) in damages. Robinson had been previously ordered not to repeat the false allegations that Hijazi, then a schoolboy, had bullied and threatened other students.As part of the ruling, Robinson was also subjected to an injunction prohibiting him from repeating the defamatory statements.However, he acknowledged in Woolwich Crown Court that he had breached the injunction multiple times during interviews broadcast on YouTube and in a documentary.The Solicitor General of Britain launched legal proceedings against Robinson over comments made in online interviews and a documentary titled “Silenced”, which has garnered millions of views. The documentary was screened at a rally in London's Trafalgar Square in July and was also shared on his X account.Aidan Eardley, a lawyer representing the Solicitor General, informed the court that Robinson had been found guilty of contempt on three separate occasions and was jailed for it in 2019, and he also has a history of other criminal convictions.Eardley argued that disobeying a court order poses a risk of undermining public respect for the judiciary. “The harm here is that millions of people see Mr. Yaxley-Lennon thumbing his nose at the court,” he added.Robinson 's lawyer Sasha Wass said: ""He acted in the way that he did, and he accepts his culpability, because he passionately believes in free speech, a free press and the overwhelming desire that he has to expose the truth.""Wass further revealed that the film 'Silenced' had been ""effectively commissioned"" by Infowars , a company owned by US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.In his ruling, Judge Jeremy Johnson sentenced Yaxley-Lennon to 18 months in prison, with a reduction of three days for time already served following his arrest on Friday.The judge offered Yaxley-Lennon the opportunity to reduce his sentence by four months if he attempted to ""purge"" his contempt, which would involve actions such as removing copies of 'Silenced' from circulation.Robinson is a prominent far-right figure in Britain, known for founding the English Defence League (EDL), a nationalist and anti-Islamist organisation.Earlier this summer, the 41-year-old was accused of inciting protests that escalated into a week of violent unrest across England and Northern Ireland.He faced accusations from some media and politicians of inciting tensions that contributed to days of rioting across Britain at the end of July, following the murder of three young girls at a dance workshop in Southport.Despite being unable to attend due to his imprisonment, thousands of supporters gathered in central London on Saturday for a Unite the Kingdom rally that Robinson had organised.Robinson has a history of legal troubles, having previously been jailed for offenses such as assault, contempt of court, and mortgage fraud.Although banned from Twitter in 2018, he was reinstated following Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform, which has since been renamed X. Robinson currently has a following of 1 million on the social network.","Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a British anti-Muslim activist also known as Tommy Robinson, was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Monday.
