Army helps ring in mobile connectivity in Ladakh’s border villages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-helps-ring-in-mobile-connectivity-in-ladakhs-border-villages/articleshow/112821523.cms,"NEW DELHI: We have seen the Indian Army stepping up to help civil authorities with relief and rescue operations during natural disasters or quell civic unrest. But in Ladakh , in addition to defending the border, it has also played a pivotal role in bringing mobile connectivity in forward villages.Since 2017, the Army has forged a unique collaboration with locals by providing optical fibre links for mobile service in three isolated villages in the Chushul constituency of LAHDC (Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council).The optical fibre link has been a dealbreaker for telecom operators as the thin population in the isolated villages makes laying optic-fibre lines through the mountainous terrain expensive and the service unremunerative for them.Under a civil-military partnership initiative piloted by Konchok Stanzin, who represents the constituency in LAHDC, mobile service was launched in the three villages with contribution from all stakeholders. Stanzin used his Constituency Development Fund to support construction of the power supply system, while the Army provided the optical fibre link and the telecom operator put up the mobile tower.Phobrang, a remote village 158 kms east of Leh, became the latest beneficiary of this initiative last week when Airtel launched 4G service in the area that serves as the gateway to the military hot spots of Gogra and Hot Springs in the northern bank of Pangong lake.“This achievement is a testament to the power of collective effort and the importance of connecting even the most remote parts of the country to the digital world,” Stanzin said after inaugurating the service last Wednesday to mark the first instance of such collaboration with a private operator.In this case, Stanzin funded a solar power plant from his Constituency Development Fund and the villagers built a battery bank to ensure 24X7 supply, while the Army laid a 5 km-long optical fibre cable to connect the mobile tower put up by Airtel.As reported by TOI on April 13, 2021, Stanzin had earlier successfully used the formula to bring state-run BSNL’s 2G service at Merak, a village facing the Finger areas of Pangong. In this case, the Army pitched in by allotting capacity for civilian traffic in a 25-Km fibre optic link to Chushul.In 2017, the same formula led to the launch of BSNL service in Kargyam area, which lies along the alternative road connecting Chushul with 114 Brigade headquarters at Tangtse.4G mobile connectivity in Phobrang will be especially helpful for graziers during the winter and also go a long way in boosting tourism in the area. In addition to these villages, Chushul, Demchok and Nyoma in forward areas of eastern Ladakh that are open for tourists now have 4G service from private operators set up with support from the USO (Universal Service Obligation) Fund.",The Army has forged a unique collaboration with locals by providing optical fibre links for mobile service in three isolated villages. The optical fibre link has been a dealbreaker for telecom operators as the thin population in the isolated villages makes laying optic-fibre lines expensive and the service unremunerative for them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112821566,imgsize-87648,width-400,resizemode-4/112821566.jpg"

Education ministry withholds SSA funds to TN for not accepting NEP provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/education-ministry-withholds-ssa-funds-to-tn-for-not-accepting-nep-provisions/articleshow/112818894.cms,"CHENNAI: The Union education ministry has withheld the first instalment of Rs 573 crore under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to Tamil Nadu for not accepting provisions of the National Education Policy ( NEP ), such as the three-language formula in the PM Schools for Rising India (PM-SHRI) scheme.The Project Approval Board has allocated a sum of Rs 3,586 crore under SSA to the state for 2024-2025.Of this amount, the Centre 's contribution is Rs 2,152 crore (60%), to be released in four instalments, while state govt's share is Rs1,434 crore (40%). The first instalment should have been received in June, but central govt is yet to respond to the letters and reminders from Tamil Nadu on releasing the amount.With no funds, 15,000-odd teachers including block resource teacher educators (BRTEs), part-time teachers and special teachers, may not get their salary next month. Further, the reimbursement of fees for students enrolled in 25% quota under RTE Act, transport facilities to children in remote areas, teachers training, and self-defence training for girls studying in classes VI to XII are also likely to get affected.""SSA scheme has been running in the past few months with the state's share of funds. However, going forward, it will be challenging to run the scheme without the Union govt's contribution. It will affect all the existing schemes and activities of SSA,"" an official said.During the review meetings held in July in New Delhi, it was emphasised that the MoU for the establishment of PM-SHRI schools must be signed for the funds to be released.""The TN govt has sent the MoU letter to the education ministry for approval by excluding the provision that mandates adherence to the NEP guidelines in PM-SHRI schools. However, this request has been declined,"" the official added.The MoU also has some specific provisions, including the 5+3+3+4 curricular structure and the introduction of vocational education from class VI, as per the NEP. Tamil Nadu has been following a two-language formula for more than five decades.Kerala, West Bengal, Delhi and Punjab are also yet to sign the MoU for PM-SHRI schools. Education experts criticised the Centre's move. ""SSA is supposed to be the top welfare scheme in the field of children's education. Under no circumstances can it be treated like this. It is a very unfortunate development as it could affect lakhs of children from poor backgrounds,"" said former NCERT director Krishna Kumar.Education activist P B Prince Gajendrababu said Tamil Nadu MPs should raise the issue in Parliament. ""SSA Shiksha and PM-SHRI are two different schemes by the Union govt. Both have no connection.

"Sexual assault of patients inside hospitals in India widespread, but hardly studied",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sexual-assault-of-patients-inside-hospitals-in-india-widespread-but-hardly-studied/articleshow/112818752.cms,"Feb 2024- A 24-year-old undergoing treatment for lung infection in the ICU of a hospital in Alwar was sedated and raped by a male nurse.

Kolkata: New Details About August 9 Horror At RG Kar Hospital Out

Sexual assault of patients inside hospitals is far from uncommon as is clear from these newspaper reports of cases from across India. Yet, there have been no studies on sexual assault of patients. On the other hand, there is an abundance of studies and research on violence that health workers, especially doctors and nurses, suffer at the hands of patients and/or their relatives.In fact, there is hardly any research on violence of any kind against patients in India, whether verbal, physical or sexual, with the exception of a few studies on 'obstetric violence' defined as violence against women by health care providers during childbirth, and on violence against patients with psychiatric ailments.In the few studies that exist, even sexual assault or molestation of patients is described euphemistically as ""sexual boundary violations"". Similarly, there is some pushback against the use of the term obstetric violence with a preference for the term 'mistreatment'.In the context of obstetric violence, studies have recorded how patients and their relatives are verbally abused and humiliated by healthcare providers and how they are physically abused in the way pelvic examinations are done and the general 'rough treatment' meted out to the pregnant women. However, patients' advocates point out that such verbal and physical abuse is common even in non-obstetric settings in the hospital.TOI sought the help of several health researchers to look for studies on violence against patients. ""The literature is scarce. Why would perpetrators document their wrongs?"" asked one of the researchers. Most of the research on healthcare is done by health providers and they are unlikely to be researching their own wrongdoings, remarked another.""Medicine in India is paternalistic and the providers don't feel the need to involve patients as equals in the process of treatment. There are so many forms of violence against patients, both systemic and structural, and they need to be documented, just like in the studies on violence against health workers, and the reasons and the context need to be studied. The violence is an open secret that is all too familiar to patients, but somehow there is no appetite for research on this. Patients are powerless and their families are mostly scared to speak up as they fear retaliation against their loved ones who are in the care of the hospital and at the mercy of the doctors and nurses. There is no system for grievance redressal and hence no data on the violence they face,"" said Malini Aisola, of the Campaign for Dignified and Affordable Healthcare.""Independently validated and objective reporting of patients' concerns does not exist; in the given climate, no organisation is prepared to report the data publicly, even if it collects data properly in the first instance,"" observed a rare study on patient safety in India.","There is hardly any research on violence of any kind against patients in India, whether verbal, physical or sexual.

"Unified Pension Scheme vs OPS vs NPS: How is UPS different from National Pension Scheme, Old Pension Scheme?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/unified-pension-scheme-vs-ops-vs-nps-how-is-ups-different-from-national-pension-scheme-old-pension-scheme/articleshow/112796028.cms,"UPS vs OPS vs NPS

:

Unified Pension Scheme (UPS): Top Features

Under the UPS, employees with a minimum qualifying service of 25 years will receive an assured pension of 50% of the average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months prior to superannuation.

For service periods between 10 and 25 years, the pension will be proportional.

In the event of an employee's demise, their family will receive an assured pension of 60% of the employee's pension immediately before their demise.

The scheme also includes an assured minimum pension of Rs 10,000 per month upon superannuation after a minimum of 10 years of service.

The UPS will apply inflation indexation to the assured pension, assured family pension, and assured minimum pension.

Dearness Relief will be based on the All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (AICPI-IW), similar to service employees.

Additionally, employees will receive a lump sum payment at superannuation, calculated as 1/10th of monthly emoluments (pay + DA) for every completed six months of service. This lump sum payment is separate from gratuity and does not impact the assured pension amount.

Employees choosing the UPS will not incur any extra financial burden. Their contribution will stay at 10 percent, while the government's contribution will rise from 14 percent to 18.5 percent.

National Pension Scheme (NPS): Top Features

Under NPS, central government employees contribute 10% of their basic salary, while the government contributes 14%, according to an ET report.

The pension amount in NPS is not fixed as it is linked to market movements, whereas UPS provides an assured pension of 50% of the salary for those who joined the service after January 1, 2004.

Family pension under NPS depends on the accumulated corpus in the pension fund and the chosen annuity plan at retirement.

NPS has been implemented for all government employees, except those in the armed forces, who joined the central government on or after January 1, 2004. It is also available for private-sector employees. Most state/Union Territory governments have also notified NPS for their new employees.

Old Pension Scheme (OPS): Top Features

The Old Pension Scheme (OPS) provided retired government employees with a monthly pension equal to 50 percent of their last drawn salary. This amount was subject to increase in line with the hike in the Dearness Allowance (DA) rates. Upon retirement, employees were also entitled to receive a gratuity payment, with a maximum limit of Rs 20 lakh.

Under the OPS, if a retired employee passed away, their family would continue to receive pension benefits. Another notable aspect of the OPS was that no deductions were made from an employee's salary towards pension contributions, which is in contrast to the NPS.

The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees who joined the service after January 1, 2004. This scheme, which will be implemented from April 1, 2025, guarantees a pension equal to 50% of the basic salary. The decision to introduce UPS comes in response to several non-BJP states reverting to the DA-linked Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and employee organizations in other states demanding the same.Employees have the option to choose between UPS and NPS.So how does UPS compare to NPS? And how does it compare to the OPS? We take a look:NPS and the newly proposed UPS differ in terms of government contributions, pension amounts, and family pension provisions.Recently, several states in India, including Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Punjab, have made the decision to revert to the Old Pension Scheme, moving away from the NPS.","The Modi government has introduced a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme.

"Release, withdraw, re-release: Protests over J&K candidates list force rare BJP flip-flop",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/release-withdraw-re-release-protests-over-jk-candidates-list-force-rare-bjp-flip-flop/articleshow/112814592.cms,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday released the first list of 44 candidates for the upcoming J&K assembly elections, a day after the party's top brass led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting over the names. However, in a rare turn of events, the party was forced to withdraw the original list and release a new one with just 15 names for the first phase of elections.The party then released another list with just one name.The hasty retreat was triggered by protests at party's headquarters in Jammu - a rare public show of anger against the decision of the top leadership. There have not been many instances of such open dissent within the BJP in the last 10 years. In fact, the BJP has often taken digs at opposition parties, including the Congress, for failing to enforce discipline within its ranks.However, this is not the first time that the BJP has made a U-turn in the recent past. The third term of the party at the Centre has been marked by quite a few instances when the party has been forced to make a retreat.The BJP which pushed through its governance agenda with gusto in the first two terms, is coming to terms with the realities of coalition compulsion despite all the bravado of ""business as usual."" PM Modi is dependent on allies for the survival of his third government and hence can not afford to ignore their concerns.The first U-turn made by the BJP government was its decision to put on hold UPSC's ""lateral entry"" move to induct 45 officers. With the opposition parties accusing the government of using lateral entry to bypass reservations and some key allies echoing similar views - the Modi government was quick to request the UPSC to withdraw the advertisement.Then there was the Waqf Bill, which was introduced in Parliament to bring about transparency in the functioning of the Waqf boards at the state level, was sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee for further discussions. Incidentally, in the first two terms of the government, when the BJP had majority on its own, not many bills were sent to the JPC despite several opposition demands. However, with BJP’s own allies favouring a detailed debate on the proposed changes, the government had little option.The Congress has claimed that government's decision to launch the Unified Pension Scheme - guaranteeing pension to govt employees - was another policy decision influenced by the allies. BJP's earlier position was that the National Pension System (NPS), introduced in 2004, was a ""revolutionary thing"" and was good for state finances.The UPS assures a lifelong pension of 50 per cent of the last drawn salary while under NPS pension was linked to the accumulated value of the contributions made by the employee and the government during the former's working life. The NPS, on the other hand, is based on defined contributions by employees and employers, which are invested in selected funds, with the pension amount depending on the returns on those investments.Modi 3.0 dependence on allies was reflected in the first Union Budget of the current term when two critical ally states - Andhra Pradesh and Bihar got special allowances and key projects. Both Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar had demanded special status for their states. While the Modi government did not announce that it ensured that the two leaders were kept in good humour.Clearly, the way ahead is not going to be easy and Modi 3.0 will have to continue to keep all the allies in good humour making this government more of NDA 3.0. And while coalition pressure will continue to be there, the BJP top leadership would not want any additional pressures from within that sends out ""weak"" signals.",BJP forced to withdraw the original list and release a new one with just 15 names for the first phase of elections. The hasty retreat was triggered by protests at party's headquarters in Jammu. There have not been many instances of open dissent within the BJP in the last 10 years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112815748,imgsize-4959827,width-400,resizemode-4/112815748.jpg"

"Pollution leading to rise in mortality risk across all age groups, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-new-study-flags-direct-link-of-air-pollution-with-rise-in-mortality-in-india-congress-slams-govt-for-being-in-denial/articleshow/112814975.cms,"Delhi, Mumbai among cities with pollution mortality risk

NEW DELHI: A new study conducted by the researchers of the Mumbai-based International Institute for Population Sciences ( IIPS ) and other scientific institutions shows that the air pollution in India poses a significant threat to human health, leading to a substantial rise in mortality observed for all age‐groups in the districts with the critical pollutant PM2.5 levels exceeding the acceptable limit under the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).The study, using the govt mortality and socio-demographic data from the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) 2019-2021, shows the highest over two fold increase (119%) in the odds of mortality (risk) among children in the age group of one to five years followed by 104% rise in infants up to one year, 86% increase in newborns less than 30 days old and 13% rise in adults in the districts where the PM2.5 levels crossed the acceptable annual average limit of 40 μg/m3. The statistical comparison was made from the districts where the PM2.5 levels remained within 10 μg/m3.If one looks at PM2.5 data of major cities, the finding means that such a mortality risk can be noticed in many big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur, Kolkata, Patna, Ranchi and Ahmedabad among others where the pollutant levels crossed the acceptable limits even during the Covid pandemic year.The study, published last week in the journal GeoHealth, took both the ambient and household air pollutant data from the Greenhouse Gas Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model and correlated it with the NFHS data to arrive at its conclusion saying the ""interaction between elevated PM2.5 levels and household air pollution further amplifies mortality risks""..The scientific findings of IIPS study assume significance as the govt has invariably denied any direct link of air pollution with mortality. During the budget session in July, the environment ministry in written response to a question said, ""There is no conclusive data available to establish a direct correlation of death exclusively with air pollution.""Air pollution is one of the many factors affecting respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Health is impacted by a number of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals apart from the environment.""The ministry's response came to a question on the study published in The Lancet Planetary Health Journal that claimed that 7.2% of all daily deaths in 10 of the largest and most polluted cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, in India were linked to PM2.5 levels. The ministry noted that the Lancet finding was ""based on study conducted using statistical models"" and cited its limitations, saying the study was unable to conduct analysis of cause-specific mortality.Underlining the findings of the IIPS study, Congress member in Rajya Sabha and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday criticised the Centre over its approach to deal with the ""rapidly deteriorating air quality"" in the country and said, ""This government's modus operandi is to deny that there is a real air pollution-linked mortality problem, underfund programmes targeted at mitigating pollution, fail to utilize the resources that it allocates, and misuse the funds that do get spent.""Ramesh also suggested eight-point measures to prevent such a crisis in India, saying the first step must be to acknowledge the public health crisis linked to air pollution across wide swathes of India. ""We must revisit and totally revamp both the Air Pollution (Control and Prevention) Act of 1981 and the NAAQS put into effect in November 2009,"" he said.His other suggestions include higher allocation of fund under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), adopting measurement of PM2.5 levels as the yardstick for performance, reorientation of NCAP to focus on all sources of emissions, adoption of airshed approach for air quality control, legal backing to NCAP and strict enforcement of air pollution norms for coal power plants.Though all air pollutants - nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxides (SO2), volatile organic compounds, and polycyclic aro-matic hydrocarbons - are significantly associated with morbidity and mortality, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm, has been studied most intensively and used as a representative indicator of exposure to air pollution and its association with various morbidity conditions.Researchers involved in the study include Mihir Adhikary and Nandita Saikia of the department of public health and mortality at IISA, Mumbai; Pallav Purohit and Wolfgang Schopp of the Pollution Management Research Group, Energy, Climate and Environment (ECE) Programmes, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria; and Vladimir Canudas-Romo of the School of Demography, ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.Referring to their findings, they suggested the policymakers should focus on reducing the anthropogenic PM2.5 emission at least to reach the NAAQS, which can substantially reduce disease burden and, more precisely, mortality.",A new study shows that air pollution in India poses a significant threat to human health. The study shows the highest over two fold increase (119%) in the odds of mortality (risk) among children in the age group of one to five years.

Congratulations to the people there.""Making the announcement earlier, home minister Amit Shah said on X, ""In pursuit of PM Narendra Modi ji's vision to build a developed and prosperous Ladakh, the MHA has decided to create five new districts in the Union Territory.

SC grants pension to 6 SFF temp employees who served 30+ years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-grants-pension-to-6-sff-temp-employees-who-served-30-yrs/articleshow/112817510.cms,"SC terms denial of pension to

SFF

men ‘arbitrary’

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has directed the govt to extend sixth pay commission benefits, including pensionary benefits, to personnel engaged to manage savings scheme deposits (SSD) of Special Frontier Force.Six SSD personnel were recruited on a temporary basis in the 1970s. The UPA govt had denied service benefits and pension to these personnel when they retired, even though they had served for over 30 years.The Armed Forces Tribunal had upheld the govt's decision, following which the SSD personnel appealed in the SC.Six SSD personnel, who were recruited on temporary basis in 1970s, were receiving travel allowance, dearness allowance, house rent allowance, special security allowance, gratuity, bonus, winter allowance and high-altitude allowance along with salary as per fourth and fifth pay commissions.However, when the sixth pay commission was implemented for SFF personnel, these SSD personnel were not given any allowance and instead paid a consolidated Rs 3,000 per month. When they retired after serving SFF for more than 30 years, they demanded pension as per sixth pay commission. But their representation was rejected by the govt in 2012.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Sandeep Meha, in a 30-page analysis of the SSD employees’ case, found that the govt had consistently treated them as regular employees. “The mere classification of employees as ‘temporary’ or ‘permanent’ is not merely a matter of nomenclature but carries significant legal implications, particularly in terms of the service benefits and protections,” it said.Justice Mehta said, “In the present case, the totality of circumstances indicates that despite their formal classification as temporary employees , appellants’ employment bears substantial hallmarks of regular govt service. “Denial of pensionary benefits solely on the basis of their temporary status, without due consideration of these factors, appears to be an oversimplification of their employment relation with govt. This approach runs the risk of creating a class of employees who, despite serving the govt for decades in a manner indistinguishable from regular employees, are deprived of the benefits and protections typically accorded to govt servants.”Justices Kohli and Mehta said, “We are of the opinion that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants is not tenable or justifiable in the eyes of law as the same is arbitrary and violates the fundamental rights as guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.”","Six SSD personnel were recruited on a temporary basis in the 1970s.

"Indian, Chinese warships dock in Colombo, send out ripples",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-chinese-warships-dock-in-colombo-send-out-ripples/articleshow/112817022.cms,"NEW DELHI: The 'Great Game' between India and China for strategic influence in the Indian Ocean Region ( IOR ) continues, while their troops remain locked in a military confrontation along the land borders.The docking of a frontline Indian warship, guided-missile destroyer INS Mumbai, at Colombo on Monday morning coincided with three Chinese warships doing the same, generating some waves in the neighbourhood.""Chinese warships, including those part of its anti-piracy escort forces, are now staying in the IOR for a much longer time than earlier,"" an Indian defence establishment official said.""The expanding Chinese naval presence in the IOR, along with Beijing's hunt for additional logistical turnaround facilities in the region, has become a major challenge for India,"" he added. To be sure, the 140-warship Indian Navy certainly needs adequate force-levels to ""take care"" of Pakistan and ""deter"" China in the IOR.The Indian Navy closely tracked the three Chinese warships, destroyer Hefei, and landing platform docks (amphibious ships) Wuzhishan and Qilianshan, with a combined crew of almost 1,500 personnel, right from the moment they entered the IOR till their docking at Colombo on Monday morning.Sri Lanka welcomed INS Mumbai, which is commanded by Captain Sandeep Kumar with a crew of 410 sailors, as well as the Chinese warships ""in compliance with naval traditions"". INS Mumbai and the Chinese warships are scheduled to separately hold ""passage exercises"" with Sri Lankan warships on their departure, again coinciding on August 29.Having already lost out to Beijing in the Maldives, with the Mohamed Muizzu govt signing a defence cooperation pact with China and forcing India to withdraw its military personnel operating a Dornier aircraft and two advanced light helicopters, the docking of Chinese warships at Colombo will obviously not go well down with New Delhi. India, in the past, had registered its strong protest with Colombo when it had permitted Chinese warships, spy vessels and submarines to dock at Lankan ports.Amid this strategic tussle, all eyes are now on the Sri Lankan Presidential elections slated for Sept 21. For India, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is still a better bet than Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the National People's Power, which is perceived to be pro-China.With the world's largest Navy with over 360 warships and submarines, China has been steadily bolstering its ""underwater domain awareness"" in the IOR through its almost permanent deployment of survey and research 'spy' vessels in the region to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations, as reported by TOI earlier.The fast expanding China-Pakistan collusiveness in the maritime domain is also a major concern. China is helping Pakistan build a strong Navy, having already delivered four Type 054A/P multi-role frigates, with eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines also in the pipeline. ""By 2028-29, Pakistan will have the same number of assets as India's Western Naval Command,"" an officer said.","The docking of a frontline Indian warship, guided-missile destroyer INS Mumbai, at Colombo on Monday morning coincided with three Chinese warships.

We took stock of progress in our bilateral relations and cooperation in the multilateral fora, including the Quad,” said Modi in a post on X.While neither side said that the leaders discussed the possibility of an early Quad summit , the talks took place in the middle of efforts to have the delayed summit on the margins of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York next month.With Modi set to represent India at the UNGA, India is keen to host the summit on the sidelines there. As the US will remain preoccupied with the upcoming presidential elections for the next few months, this may effectively be the last chance for India to host the summit this year.It was India’s turn to host the summit in 2024 but President Joe Biden’s inability to visit India in January coupled with India’s own elections in May put paid to the hopes of having the meeting in the first half of the year. India explored the possibility of hosting the meeting on the margins of the G7 summit in June in Italy but that didn’t materialise because Australia wasn’t invited for G7.Hopes of having the summit on the margins of UNGA were rekindled this month after Japan PM Fumio Kishida decided to travel to the US to address the Assembly for what will be his last overseas trip as PM. Kishida is not seeking reelection in the ruling LDP presidential poll on September 27 and will step down as PM after his return from the US. Interestingly, former Japan PM Yoshihide Suga too had travelled to the US in September, 2021, to participate in the first in-person Quad summit just before he stepped down.Amid Chinese assertiveness, Quad is being seen as playing an increasingly important role in ensuring a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is resilient and free from coercion.In a first, India joined other Quad nations last month in upholding in a joint statement the 2016 arbitral tribunal award that refuted Beijing’s expansive claims over SCS waters in its maritime dispute with the Philippines as the basis for peacefully resolving such disputes.

"Switching careers: 'Tough road for women, despite notable success stories'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/switching-careers-tough-road-for-women-despite-notable-success-stories/articleshow/112815343.cms,"Switching careers has never been easy, particularly for women. Despite the evolving workplace, women still face significant challenges when considering a change in their professional paths. However, there are success stories that highlight the possibility of overcoming these hurdles with determination and support.A recent study reveals that over 70% of women encounter significant challenges when contemplating a career switch .Many struggle with balancing family responsibilities and societal expectations. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, only 30% of women successfully switch careers, compared to more than 50% of men.While career switching remains challenging for women, some have excelled in making this transition. For instance, Mahika Shah, who transformed her career from a businesswoman and architect to a Vastu consultant, and now, an aspiring actress. Reflecting on her decision, she said, ""It wasn't easy, but following my passion has been incredibly rewarding.""Shah also noted, ""Career switching is a crucial and sensitive decision for women. They often have to rise above societal and familial pressures to make it. A strong mindset and proper guidance are essential for navigating this path successfully.""Though the trend of women switching careers is gradually increasing, there is still much work to be done. More opportunities and support systems are needed to empower women to make career decisions without fear or hesitation.","Only 30% of women successfully switch careers, compared to more than 50% of men. Mahika Shah transformed her career from a businesswoman and architect to a Vastu consultant, and now, an aspiring actress.

"'Swift visa approval, more direct flights key to boost Indo-US tourism'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/swift-visa-approval-more-direct-flights-key-to-boost-indo-us-tourism/articleshow/112814539.cms,"MUMBAI: India and the US have a lot of unexploited potential in the tourism and hospitality space and more direct flights between the two countries and swifter visa application process is the need of the hour to boost the segment, said sector experts and officials at the 1st Indo-US Tourism & Hospitality Summit , organized by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce (IACC) today at New Delhi.Industry participants and officials noted that although India and the US have robust bilateral relations, and a large number of people from both the countries visit the other country, there is enough scope, primarily in terms of aviation experience.Addressing the event, the Attorney General of India, R. Venkataramani stressed on the need for responsible tourism. He emphasized that India would continue to play a role in building a cohesive and peaceful world, wherein tourism would be a key factor.""India is beginning to build a world of togetherness. So, how do we therefore build a world of togetherness in which all of us have equal regard. Each country, each community, each faith have equal regard for each and every one of us. And from that equal regard what we get is equal reward for our relationships. It can be equal reward in terms of market, in terms of commerce, industry. So I think India stands for equal regard and equal reward principle and I think tourism is probably one umbrella where we can talk more and more about it. And to project India's position in it.""""I think it's important for us to spread this message of goodwill and togetherness. What else can be a better package than a tourism package? I think all of us can build into it, weave into it and be part of India's global journey towards a higher level of togetherness at the global level.""Speaking at the programme, Lalit Bhasin, Immediate Past National President of IACC outlined his association with the tourism and hospitality space. ""My association with tourism, hospitality was nearly 6 decades, when I started practicing law,"" he said.In a panel discussion on ""Outbound Tourism, India to USA"", Suman Billa, Additional Secretary, Union Ministry of Tourism highlighted the strong bilateral partnership and the growth in travel between the two countries, there is significant headroom for progress in this space.""So there's a lot that is happening based in India and I think it is a little bit surprising even though the numbers are good. If you look at from a tourism perspective, we really have not capitalized on the potential that we have. I think judging by the potential of what we have, there is probably much more headroom for us to capture,"" Billa said, adding that the growth in the Indian economy is unlikely to slow down adding all the more potential for growth in outbound tourism.""India has been the fastest growing of the lot. And nothing in the market seems to suggest that it is going to slow down. So I think our natural affinity to the US will draw us closer and will open more pathways for us to explore and I think tourism should be one of those pathways which will open the doors for the possibility, but to build more understanding between the people of India and the United States,"" he added.He noted that although a US visa is valid for 10 years, not requiring any frequent updates by a visa holder, the process of getting the visa for the world's largest economy is a cumbersome and tiresome process. He also stressed on the need for more direct flights between India and the US.Jonathan M Heimer, minister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs, India US Commercial Service, however, noted that over the past one year, the pace of visa application processing has gained momentum leading to record visa issuances. ""On the backend for the application processing, we've been able to process something like 60% more visas with more or less the same resources. And also we have issued more than 1.1 million visas in the last year, which for us, is a record and that's just going to continue to go up that number,"" Heimer added.In his response to the issue of the visa application process, Rajesh Magow, Co-Founder & Group CEO, MakeMyTrip Limited suggested the introduction of short term visas for tourists.""There are many other countries which have done it, maybe short-term tourist visas can be quick, maybe that could be one potential innovation that can happen as well,"" he said. Speaking in favour of boosting international tourism he said that international travel is not growing at the cost of domestic travel.Talking on the revival of air travel from the Covid-induced slowdown, Harvinder Singh, Director India & Middle East, United Airlines noted that all the three key segments of air travel -- business, students and leisure -- have picked up and gained momentum.""What we see in terms of the segmentation is business, there is the student along with the leisure part and what we have really observed is all these segments are actually going,"" he said. Singh also stressed on the need for better customer experience with the help of newer technologies and other resources.",India and the US have a lot of unexploited potential in the tourism and hospitality space. More direct flights between the two countries and swifter visa application process is the need of the hour to boost the segment.

Narendra Modi: MHA announces five new districts in Ladakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-announces-five-new-districts-in-ladakh/articleshow/112812881.cms,"NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Monday approved the creation of five new districts in the Union territory of Ladakh, in a move aimed at better percolation of development and welfare schemes to the grassroots, thus boosting governance.“In pursuit of PM Shri @narendramodi Ji's vision to build a developed and prosperous Ladakh, the MHA has decided to create five new districts in the union territory.The new districts, namely Zanskar, Drass, Sham, Nubra and Changthang, will take the benefits meant for the people to their doorsteps by bolstering governance in every nook and cranny,” home minister Amit Shah shared on ‘X’ on Monday.Quoting Shah’s post, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated on ‘X’: “Creation of five new districts in Ladakh is a step towards better governance and prosperity. Zanskar, Drass, Sham, Nubra, and Changthang will now receive more focused attention, bringing services and opportunities even closer to the people. Congratulations to the people there”.The five new districts will take the total number of districts in Ladakh to seven. Currently, the northernmost UT — unique in terms of its large area, difficult terrain, very low population density and strategic location next to China — comprises the two districts of Leh and Kargil.While approving the five new districts on Monday, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) directed the Ladakh administration to set up a committee to assess various aspects related to the formation of new districts, such as their headquarters, boundaries and structure; and creation of posts, etc. The panel will submit its report within three months, based on which the UT of Ladakh will send the final proposal regarding creation of the new districts to the MHA for further action.Ladakh, earlier a part of erstwhile state of J&K, was hived off into a separate Union territory as part of reorganisation of J&K in 2019.Stating that Ladakh is one of the least populated areas of the country, MHA in a statement on Monday said: “Being extremely difficult and inaccessible, at present the district administration was facing many difficulties in reaching the grassroots level. After the formation of these districts, now all the public welfare schemes of the Central govt and Ladakh administration will be able to reach the people easily and more and more people will be able to take advantage of them. This important decision of MHA will prove to be very useful in the all-round development of Ladakh”.Since 2015, the Narendra Modi government has made several efforts to boost development in Ladakh by approving nine schemes worth over Rs 21,000 crore exclusively for the region. However Ladakh had continued to lag behind in development before the Modi government made it a separate UT in 2019. The Centre has since raised Ladakh ‘a budget to Rs 5,958 crore per year. Connectivity of Ladakh was enhanced with the construction of 750 km of roads and 30 helipads, thus boosting tourism and creating employment opportunities in the UT. Ten new tourists circuits and five mountaineering tracks were opened. Ladakh’s major electricity deficit problem was addressed with the setting up of transmission lines as well as solar and hydel power projects.Smart classrooms have helped refurbish the schools of Ladakh. A Central university was approved for Ladakh. To improve the health services in the UT, hospitals have been set up in Leh and Kargil districts and ICU wards created for children and senior citizens. SIDCO was set up in the UT for development of small industries and 1000 metric tonnes worth of cold storage facilities okayed.Home minister Amit Shah also approved the first ever winter-grade diesel sales outlet for Ladakh, allowing availability of diesel to its residents in the harshest of winters.“The Modi government is committed to creating abundant opportunities for the people of Ladakh,” Shah stated on Monday.","The new districts, namely Zanskar, Drass, Sham, Nubra and Changthang, will take the benefits meant for the people to their doorsteps.

GenAI will ensure strong hiring growth: Infosys CEO Parekh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/genai-will-ensure-strong-hiring-growth-infosys-ceo-parekh/articleshow/112787130.cms,"When do you see this low single-digit growth environment changing? Hiring too has been very weak. Is it primarily because of global macro conditions?

The American economy is seen to have been relatively strong for some time. Yet, there is this demand slowdown for IT…

In 2015, Infosys had funded OpenAI and ANSR (GCC consultancy and solutions company). But it subsequently did not take that forward or divested. Today, the two words everyone in the Indian tech industry are talking about are AI and GCC. Very recently, Accenture invested a big amount in ANSR. Did you miss the bus on those two opportunities?

There are GCCs that say it’s more efficient to do tech in a GCC, than with an IT services partner. Several seem to be bringing more and more work in-house. They also seem to want to do cutting-edge tech like GenAI themselves, instead of giving it to IT services players. They seem to be taking over the higher value work.

How do you see your progress with GenAI? Where is it having the biggest impact?

Can you provide metrics of improvements in areas where GenAI is being applied?

Nilekani spoke about how AI doomerism has quietened down. With his tech evangelism and boardroom connections and your soft power leadership, how are you rallying forces, especially on the sales and delivery side, to become an AI-first enterprise?

Infosys is in the leaderboard quadrant in terms of use cases for GenAI. Some of your peers have called out the pipeline for GenAI, even though it’s not converted into revenue yet. When do you think you'll move away from POCs to seeing revenues trickle into the books?

But the split between traditional AI and Gen AI, do you think there's value in calling them out separately?

How comfortable are enterprises with chatbots? There are hallucination issues.

How do you position yourself against the big four? They straddle the entire spectrum, while companies like yours predominantly do technology work.

Cybersecurity is a boardroom agenda. In your annual report, you've disclosed how Infosys is under-covered for cybersecurity insurance. Do you want to increase that coverage?

Is there a truce after the GST pre-showcause GST tax notice?

BENGALURU: Salil Parekh looks trim and fit. When we ask him about it, the Infosys CEO & MD says he isn’t getting as much time for fitness as he would like. Infosys probably requires more of his time now. The company, and its peers, are going through a lean phase. Revenue growth is in low single digits for the biggest companies, though the last quarter showed signs of incipient recovery.Global capability centres (tech & operations arms of MNCs) in India look to be taking away business that previously went to IT services partners. AI is disrupting all businesses. Nine years ago, Infosys was the company that invested in GenAI pioneer OpenAI and a GCC consulting company, only to abandon those initiatives two years later. Big miss? In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Parekh answers this and more.I think employee growth is going to be very strong. GenAI is giving us new areas where we can do projects. So, while there are some areas for improvements, overall, we see a positive revenue impact on growth. We’ve called out a guidance of 3% to 4% for the full financial year. We don't have a view at least of what the next financial year will look like in terms of growth. Broadly, we have extremely talented people in India, so I don't see how anyone can really compete with that.Large tech projects need big commitments of capital as you start those programmes, and given the interest rate increases in the last two or three years in Europe and the US, we've not seen such large programmes starting. My sense is companies are being careful. Right now, a lot of the work we see is around cost takeout or efficiency.Those, as you know, happened a while ago. If you look at generative AI, what we are doing today is market leading, and we are quite happy with the outcome there. Regarding GCCs, there are multiple themes. First, we are partners with them as they are growing in India, because many of their parent organisations have been clients of ours for years. Second, we've seen that these GCC investments have a lifecycle. Things that were created 10-15 years ago, with changes within the companies, they want to move to some different areas, and then they move away from it. So, in the last 2-3 years, we have taken over some GCCs which are older. At the start, we help and support, and as they mature, because of our scale, we are much more able to bring efficiency to those programmes. The automation we build is very different from what some of the GCCs employ. So, as they grow in the maturity lifecycle, we see clients saying, can you take that over and make it more efficient, or become partners with us.When a new technology comes, there's a lot of interest with the client to build something which is more within their own organisation. What is the benefit with us? We are doing hundreds of projects in GenAI, across every industry. Our experience, the people that we work with, the knowledge that we build will be much broader based. So, it's very difficult for someone else to have that level of expertise and depth. Because it's new, it's something that many large companies want to make sure that they have some ability to drive themselves. But as you build scale, that knowledge and depth is where we are very good. And we've seen over time that this plays out. As for efficiency, newer GCCs are probably one hundredth, if not one-thousandth of our size. It is difficult with that scale to make the sort of efficiency play we have, or even the automation tools that we use.In GenAI, we are seeing a real expansion of work. We have 270,000 people trained on GenAI, what we call GenAI aware, practitioners and experts. We are working with something like 16 different large language models. There are three big areas where we see impact. One is software development, the second is customer service, especially in operations and tech. And the third is knowledge objects – we're working with a bank in the credit area, with a pharma company in their drug discovery area, and with a telco in their product specification area – so anywhere there's knowledge objects where you can create some value from faster or more insightful ways of looking at that knowledge. We've been using these things ourselves to improve what's going on within Finacle (Infosys’s banking product). And there are several tools we built. One example is, we've taken an open-source large language model, then built a tool for ourselves on it where we can do more efficient work with Java development on a desktop. So, it completely changes the game on what we can do. We rethought all our service lines with generative AI.In software, we are seeing in the range of 15% benefits in what we are developing with our clients. In customer service, we are seeing great benefits in HR functions.Nandan is a tech visionary and he's obviously very active with us. We are fortunate in that. We want to be more aligned with where clients are going, and that was the change we made. AI-first is understanding that clients want to make changes faster internally. Internally, we have an app, InfyMe, which all of us use for internal things. We have an AI assistant that helps us, whether it's with sales, delivery, HR, or training. We feel quite good about this. We want to make sure we're doing what clients are looking for. A few years ago, there was a much stronger move to digital and cloud. That is still very much part of it. Today, there's much more of an interest in GenAI, and that's how we're changing our company. Our view is that technology will change in five years and Quantum might be the big thing. We will be more aligned to that because that's what our clients are looking for.The revenues are already beyond the PoCs. They're not just trial pilots. They're not large projects, but they're real projects with real impact. We have already been tracking what is generative AI, revenue and so on. At some stage over the next few quarters, we will start to call it out externally. I think a lot of things can be broadly put into AI. So, we are careful to make sure we are measuring GenAI the same way we did with digital. Every project is marked internally, so that we know it's an auditable process.Clients view GenAI as transformative. There are more revenue growth opportunities because you can go faster into some markets. You can do cost efficiency because you can do things better. So, there are three big advantages – revenue, cost and time. When we started digital, the cloud was one piece of it. But today it is the biggest piece in digital.The cleaner the data that is training it, the lesser the hallucination. But in normal life, we hallucinate – forget GenAI, we as people, when we are interacting, we may make some mistakes. So, there is nothing unusual about that. The idea is to reduce and not let that error contaminate other things. Today, there is no usage which is coming to what is called critical system usage, because people are waiting to see how the hallucination can be reduced further. But if you're doing it in different areas -- error mapping and making people more productive -- then you're already in a better place.We don't see them when we compete in the tech world. I think our strength, as you said, is we are very tech oriented. So, if you're a CIO looking to make a choice on who to give your technology work to, I think there are very few options outside of Infosys. Very few CIOs are going to pick someone who is not as strong as Infosys in the tech area. For large companies looking to get technology delivery done with the lowest risk, I think Infosys is the best choice going forward.In cybersecurity, we believe we are well covered, but we must highlight all the risks cybersecurity inherently has. We have security operations centres in multiple locations around the world where we support clients. Cyber is a growing area where we see clients have more needs. But there are also continuous threat actors which we must be watchful about.We gave an update a few days ago with the disclosure in the market. There is no new update from that time.","Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys, talks to TOI about the Indian tech industry's focus on AI and GCC.

'Patients brought to govt hosps in critical stage'

HYDERABAD: Severe cases of viral infections have led to Niloufer Hospital seeing about 10 children dying almost daily since the beginning of this month. TOI visited the paediatric emergency outpatient sections of the hospital to find long queues of restless parents, who were desperate to get their ailing children with high fevers, blister-ridden skin, and incessant cough admitted to the hospital.Mohd Nizam, father of a five-year-old girl, said, ""My daughter has been running a high temperature for the past eight days and is not able to eat at all. She keeps throwing up, both food and water."" Another parent, Nazia Begum, held her months-old son in her arms and said, ""My boy is running a high temperature and his legs and arms appear to be swollen. I am worried.""Doctors said that the viral load was just beginning and would only peak in future. ""We are seeing nearly a hundred admissions daily, and it is just Aug. It will peak by Oct,"" said Dr Gaurav Kumar. He added that unattended viral fevers were leading to seizures and deaths. ""We are seeing 10 to 15 deaths every day this season. That is also because a lot of 'bad cases' come our way - of patients who are in a critical state after treatment at private hospitals failed,"" he said.Hygiene issues, close-quarter living, and water stagnation were flagged as major reasons behind the spike in cases. ""Parents are not following our medical advice and do not get the required tests done. These infections are thus manifesting on the skin, along with cases of scabies,"" said Dr Gayatri. Some of those under 5 years are dying due to pneumonia and preterm complications.Dr Purna Chander, the resident medical officer of the hospital, said, ""Most cases are of viral origin. We are going for dengue and chikungunya serology to further study the cases.""Dr Ravi Kumar, superintendent of the hospital, said, ""The issue is that the children are not getting immediate care during the 'danger period', which is between day three and day five. The platelet count, as well as the blood pressure drops rapidly during this phase."" To tackle the load, over 30 paediatric doctors are on duty daily.Meanwhile, over 700 cases of viral fever are being registered daily at Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases, also known as Fever Hospital, and nearly 100 viral fever and dengue patients are being admitted.Dr Jaya Lakshmi, resident medical officer at Fever Hospital, said, ""Most cases are of dengue and other viral fevers, but there are cases of diphtheria and measles as well. If a case is severe, we refer it to Osmania hospital.""While refraining from commenting on dengue deaths in particular, Dr Vani N, director of medical education reiterated that several patients are brought to govt hospitals in a critical stage, adding to the mortality numbers.","Niloufer Hospital sees about 10 children dying almost daily since the beginning of this month.

Gangster Kapil Sangwan: W Delhi firing orchestrated from UK after businessman refused to pay ₹2cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/w-delhi-firing-orchestrated-from-uk-after-businessman-refused-to-pay-2cr/articleshow/112789033.cms,"NEW DELHI: Friday’s shooting incident at a popular confectionery outlet in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar was orchestrated by UK-based gangster Kapil Sangwan after the businessman refused to pay Rs 2 crore as protection money . Sangwan was guiding the shooters in real time through chat application Jangi, a probe has revealed.The crime branch on Sunday said it had arrested one of the main shooters, Vishu Kranti (25), involved in the incident.Confirming the arrest, special commissioner R P Upadhyay said a manhunt was underway to catch others.Sources said that Kranti and his aides, Vijay Gehlot and Sonu Filmy, were in touch with Sangwan through Jangi, and receiving instructions about targets.On Friday, they first carried out a shooting—despite a PCR van being in the vicinity—at an empty plot belonging to a builder and then arrived at the outlet and started firing, leaving customers and employees in panic.The first shooting was the fallout of a property dispute. A man named Pankaj who was present at the plot was left wounded as the shooters fired indiscriminately to instil fear in residents and the plot owner.Thereafter, Sangwan asked the shooters to proceed towards 'Singla Sweets' in Tilak Nagar and repeat the act. The bike-borne men then did exactly that and fled the spot. The incident took place at 11 pm. The shooters fired through the shop's front glass.Realising the sensitivity of the incident, the crime branch was assigned to crack the case. Six teams, led by additional commissioner Sanjay Bhatia and DCP Satish Kumar, started tracking the suspects.An informer tipped off the cops about the movement of one of the shooters in Dwarka, after which technical surveillance was mounted. ACP Ravinder Rajput, inspector Akshay and others laid a trap near a school. “The suspect was spotted and flagged down. He tried to flee by firing at the police team. However, our team chased and nabbed him. He was found using an automatic pistol, which was seized from the spot,” Bhatia said.Meanwhile, the crime branch and special cell are also working on the brazen shooting incident at a jewellery outlet in Mukherjee Nagar on Saturday, which happened within 24 hours of the Tilak Nagar incident. Motorcycle-borne miscreants had fired shots at the jewellery store and threw in a typed slip of paper in which they demanded Rs 1 crore.The probe has revealed the involvement of Sangwan's rival gang in the shooting. “Jailed gangsters Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali are suspected to be behind the shooting. They are in alliance with the Bambiha syndicate whose name was written on the paper,” said an investigator.The incarcerated gangsters may have hired shooters from UP for the job, cops suspect. The shooters fled towards Loni, analysis of CCTV footage revealed. Sangwan is currently hiding in the UK with his family. He has a Red Corner Notice by Interpol for his involvement in a string of violent crimes.Sangwan has occupied a place in the list of top five wanted gangsters after he orchestrated the murder of INLD Haryana unit chief Nafe Singh Rathi. The fugitive has been operating a lucrative extortion racket through shooters recruited via social media. His brother, Jyoti Baba, is currently serving time in Tihar jail.Sangwan has a rivalry with rival gangster Manjeet Mahal ever since the latter bumped off Sangwan's brother-in-law in 2015. Sangwan hit back and the siblings carried out a series of murders in the last decade. Sources say efforts are underway to bring him back to the country.Sangwan's association with gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi and Kala Jathedi has made him a rival of Neeraj Bawana and Bali as well. Delhi seems to have turned into a battleground as both groups aim to establish supremacy.","Kapil Sangwan was guiding the shooters in real time through chat application Jangi, a probe has revealed.

Legal troubles surrounding Telegram

Durov's revelation: Father to over 100 children

Pavel Durov , the enigmatic founder and CEO of Telegram , has recently made headlines not only for his business ventures but for a startling personal revelation. The billionaire, who was detained by French authorities following his arrival at Le Bourget Airport, claimed during his arrest that he has fathered over 100 children. This revelation, alongside his legal troubles, has added another layer of intrigue to the life of one of the most controversial figures in the tech world.Pavel Durov is a Russian-born entrepreneur known for his innovative contributions to the digital world.Born on October 10, 1984, in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Durov is best known for co-founding VKontakte (VK), Russia's largest social networking site, and Telegram, a globally popular messaging app.Durov’s journey in the tech industry began with the launch of VK in 2006. The platform quickly became Russia's leading social network, drawing comparisons to Facebook for its widespread popularity. However, Durov’s refusal to comply with Russian government demands, particularly concerning censorship and surveillance, led to his ousting from VK in 2014. Following his departure, Durov turned his focus to Telegram, which he had launched in 2013. Telegram distinguished itself with its strong emphasis on privacy, offering features like end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages. These features quickly attracted a massive user base, particularly in regions like Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet states.Telegram’s rapid growth has not been without controversy. The platform’s robust privacy features have made it a preferred tool for individuals and organisations concerned about surveillance. However, these same features have also attracted criminal elements, leading to widespread criticism. As per reports, Telegram has been accused of being a haven for illegal activities, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, and the distribution of child exploitation material. The platform’s lack of sufficient moderation has been a focal point of concern for law enforcement agencies worldwide.The complaints filed by Telegram users, particularly about the app's failure to moderate content effectively, led to Durov's recent detention in France. This arrest has intensified the spotlight on Durov and the platform he created, raising questions about the responsibilities of tech entrepreneurs in moderating content on their platforms.Amidst his legal troubles, Pavel Durov made a shocking personal revelation that has captured global attention. In a post on Telegram, Durov claimed that he has fathered over 100 children across 12 countries through sperm donation. This disclosure has added a surprising and personal dimension to the public's perception of the tech mogul.Durov explained that his journey into fatherhood began 15 years ago when a close friend struggling with infertility asked him to donate sperm. Intrigued by the request, Durov visited a clinic where he was informed that he was considered ""top-tier donor material."" The clinic suggested that his donations could help couples around the world who were facing similar challenges. Although initially hesitant, Durov was persuaded by the unconventional nature of the proposal and agreed to become a sperm donor.In his Telegram post, Durov expressed surprise upon learning that he had fathered over 100 children, particularly given his personal lifestyle choices. “I just found out I have over 100 biological kids. How is this possible for someone who has never been married and prefers to live alone?” Durov wrote. This revelation has not only surprised the public but has also led to widespread discussions about the implications of sperm donation and the responsibilities of donors.","Pavel Durov is the founder and CEO of messaging app Telegram.

HYDERABAD: A special meeting of the Telangana Waqf Board on Monday unanimously resolved to reject the Centre's Waqf Amendment Bill 2024 , thereby becoming the first waqf board in the country to formally oppose the proposed law.AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi , waqf board chairman Syed Azmatullah Hussaini and six members of the board attended the important meeting.Two other members attended the meeting virtually. After carefully deliberating the proposed amendments, clause by clause, and discussing with legal experts and administrators, the board decided that the bill was ""harmful"" and would damage the interests of properties owned by waqf.Soon after the meeting, Owaisi posted on X: ""The Telangana State Waqf Board has become the first Waqf Board in the country to oppose the unconstitutional Waqf Amendment Bill 2024. Must thank @TelanganaCMO for his support."" Owaisi along with All India Muslim Personal Law Board president Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani had met chief minister A Revanth Reddy and sought his support against the bill. AIMPLB leaders are meeting chief ministers of non-BJP-governed states to seek their support and will also meet opposition leaders.""Telangana has a large number of waqf properties. The state waqf board as custodian of these properties is one of the biggest stakeholders. The bill is a retrograde step to target the Muslim community and the institution of waqf. The board condemns this type of divisive agenda being pushed through the controversial bill,"" said Syed Hussaini.The board also unanimously resolved to seek an appointment with the joint working committee (formerly JPC) on the bill to present the requisite documents and data. It was decided to convene a conference of chairpersons and chief executive officers of all waqf boards where a non-BJP govt is in office, said Syed Hussaini.He further said: ""It is obvious that the proposed bill has been prepared with a particular mindset and aims at destroying the autonomy of the waqf board by bringing them under the control of district collectors who will be free to claim and determine any waqf property as govt property and give directions to mutawalli and its compliance will be binding on the mutawalli of that property.""The meeting also said the bill intends to remove the exemption of the Limitation Act and the Supreme Court-approved concept of waqf by a user.The meeting further mandates the registration of waqf mandatory before approaching the court of law for redressal while removing the powers of the waqf board and its CEO to register waqf under sections 36 and 40 of the Waqf Act.",The Telangana Waqf Board has become the first waqf board in the country to formally oppose the proposed law.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Australia announces cap on international student enrolment for 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-announces-cap-on-international-student-enrolment-for-2025/articleshow/112821971.cms,"Australia has announced a cap on international student enrolment at 270,000 for 2025, as part of the government 's efforts to manage record migration levels that have contributed to a surge in home rental prices.This decision follows a series of measures implemented since last year to end Covid-era concessions for foreign students and workers in Australia.These concessions had previously helped businesses recruit staff locally while strict border controls prevented overseas workers from entering the country.Education minister Jason Clare said in a press conference, ""There's about 10 per cent more international students in our universities today than before the pandemic and about 50 per cent more in our private vocational and training providers."" Clare said that the reforms aim to make the international student sector better and fairer, setting it up on a more sustainable footing for the future.International education is a significant export industry for Australia, contributing A$36.4 billion ($24.7 billion) to the economy in the financial year 2022-2023. However, polls have indicated that voters are concerned about large influxes of foreign students and workers putting excessive pressure on the housing market, making immigration a potential major battleground in the upcoming election, which is less than a year away.Net immigration in Australia reached a record high in the year ending September 30, 2023, increasing by 60 per cent to 548,800. This surge in migration, driven by students from India, China, and the Philippines, has expanded the labour supply and restrained wage pressures, but it has also exacerbated an already tight housing market.To contain the surge in migration, the government recently more than doubled the visa fee for foreign students and pledged to close loopholes in rules that allowed them to continuously extend their stay.","Australia has announced a cap on international student enrolment at 270,000 for 2025.

"Mpox: Germany to give Africa 100,000 doses of vaccine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/mpox-germany-to-give-africa-100000-doses-of-vaccine/articleshow/112822570.cms,"New mpox strain is deadlier, more transmissible

Germany on Monday announced that it would donate 100,000 doses of mpox vaccine to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African nations in hopes of getting an outbreak of the disease under control.The gift will all but wipe out the German military's reserve of roughly 118,000 doses.Berlin will also lend financial support to its effort, providing funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as supporting partners in Africa through the Gavi Vaccine Alliance.Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Berlin's aim is, ""to support in solidarity the international efforts to contain mpox on the African continent.""Hebestreit, noting that these were immediate-term measures, added that Berlin would also work alongside the African Union (AU) to foster local vaccine production.The World Health Organization (WHO) this month declared a recent mpox outbreak in the DRC a global public health emergency when cases began showing up outside the country.The WHO claims the disease ""can be stopped"" but notes that this will require a comprehensive and expensive global effort.France last week announced that it would donate 100,000 doses and the US, too, will donate 50,000.Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, has been around for decades, yet a new, more virulent strain is thought to be behind its recent spread.Deadly and communicable, the Clade 1b strain has killed more than 570 people this year. The disease has spread across the DRC, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. The first European fatality was registered in Sweden.The mpox virus can spread from animals to humans but also between humans through close physical contact, most often through kissing or sexual contact.","Germany will donate 100,000 doses of mpox vaccine to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African nations.

Temporary Foreign Workers: 'Labour market has changed’: Trudeau government to cut number of foreign workers in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-to-cut-number-of-temp-foreign-workers/articleshow/112821122.cms,"Prime Minister of Canada , Justin Trudeau, has announced that his government would reduce the number of temporary foreign workers doing low-wage jobs. This move by the Trudeau government is said to be aimed to cater to the employment opportunities of the local population amid rising unemployment.Canadian PM took the matter to social media and wrote, “We’re reducing the number of low-wage, temporary foreign workers in Canada.The labour market has changed. Now is the time for our businesses to invest in Canadian workers and youth.”This announcement comes after a spike was seen in the number of foreign workers coming to Canada after the government loosened the restrictions to tackle post-Covid labour shortages.Addressing the issue, the minister of employment, workforce development and official languages, Randy Boissonnault said, ""The Temporary Foreign Worker program was designed to address labour market shortages when qualified Canadians were not able to fill those roles. Right now, we know that there are more Canadians qualified to fill open positions. The changes we are making today will prioritize Canadians workers and ensures Canadians can trust the program is meeting the needs of our economy"".After the PM’s announcement, changes would be made to the ‘ Temporary Worker Program ’, which the government believed was being used to “circumvent hiring talented workers in Canada"".As per a CBC report, the duration of the contracts under this program would be reduced to one year from two years. Also, employers can’t hire more than 10 per cent of their total workforce under the program.In areas with high unemployment rates of six per cent or more, employers will not have the option to hire temporary foreign workers (TFW) at low wages. Although some specific exceptions are made for industries such as agriculture, food and fish processing, construction, and health care, as they still face serious staffing shortages.","Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, has announced that his government would reduce the number of temporary foreign workers doing low-wage jobs.
