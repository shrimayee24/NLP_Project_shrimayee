Supreme Court to take up today validity of Places of Worship Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-take-up-today-validity-of-places-of-worship-act/articleshow/116230991.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: A day before the Supreme Court hearing on a batch of petitions challenging the validity of Places of Worship Act , citizens from various walks of life, including noted academicians, historians, former IAS and IPS officers, MPs and political parties have filed applications in support of the law, saying it was intended to safeguard secularism and to ensure communal harmony.They told the court that the petition seeking scrapping of the law was based on complete ignorance of history and glossed over the fact that Hindu kings too demolished Hindu temples, Buddhist shrines and Jain temples of conquered territories and installed their own structures in their place.Countering submission that many religious structures were taken over and converted to mosques when Mughals invaded the country, some of the applicants said even if it was assumed that certain mosques were constructed after demolishing Hindu temples by invaders, then such claims could have no end, as many Hindu temples were erected on ruins of Buddhist stupas and Buddhists could claim a right to restore such temples to stupas. They said the Act was brought to put an end to the controversy and to maintain peace and communal harmony.Some of the prominent people who approached SC separately or in groups included former Punjab DGP Julio Ribeiro, former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah, former Delhi LG Najeeb Jung, former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi, Lt Gen Zamiruddin Shah (retired), former home secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai, noted historians Romila Thapar and Mridula Mukherjee, and MPs Manoj Jha of RJD and Thol Thirumavalavan of VCK. The common theme in their pleas was that the 1991 Act was meant to preserve India's social fabric and foster communal harmony and opposed reopening of settled issues concerning religious sites.Applications have also been filed in support of the petitioners to scrap the Act. Delhi-based NGO Hindu Shree Foundation , which claims to represent interests and rights of Hindu devotees both domestically and internationally, said the Act was arbitrary and there was no justification to fix a cut-off date of Aug 15, 1947. It said there was no rational nexus between political independence and creation of Republic of India and settling the civilisational conflict emanating from colonial erasure of Hindu identity and an imposition of cultural hegemony by Islamic invaders.Former MP Chintamani Malviya, too, filed an application alleging that the law itself was violative of secularism and should be done away with. ""The Act is void and unconstitutional for many reasons. It offends rights of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs to pray, profess, practice and propagate religion. It deprives them from owning religious properties belonging to deity misappropriated by other communities. It takes away their right of judicial remedy. Centre has transgressed its legislative power by barring remedy of judicial review which is a basic feature of the Constitution. SC, in a catena of decisions, held that right to judicial remedy cannot be taken away by the state,"" he said.A joint plea filed by Ribeiro, Habibullah, ex-IFS officer Deb Mukharji and ex-IAS officer Kamal Kant Jaswal said the questions raised in this case by the petitioners stemmed from a ""strong majoritarian and anti-minorities bias"" which is an anathema to the Constitution.""The petition shows a complete ignorance of history, since it glosses over the fact that rulers demolished places of worship of subjugated dynasties and kingdoms across Indian history and across religious sects. Critical historical scholarship shows that in the pre-Islam era, several situations of religious conflict existed between Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu sects,"" they said.The joint application filed by Jung, Quraishi, Pillai and others said, ""This country has been the cradle of not only one of the oldest human civilisations but several religions and religious denominations. It is also a matter of record that there have been struggles for supremacy and propagation of religion throughout the history of this nation. In the above circumstances, the Act was enacted with the avowed objective of not letting past acts/omissions on the part of one religious group or the other, destroy the destiny of future generations and, hence, the Act is pivotal for maintaining communal harmony and preventing conflicts that may arise from disputes having historical trappings.""","Citizens from various walks of life have filed applications in support of the law.

Oppn likely to move for removal of Allahabad HC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oppn-likely-to-move-for-removal-of-allahabad-hc-judge/articleshow/116230655.cms,"Digvijay Singh

Judge removal idea floated by Digvijay Singh, backed by Sibal, Tankha

NEW DELHI: The opposition is set to file a motion in the Rajya Sabha for removal of Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav, whose controversial comments on a uniform civil code and Muslims at a VHP event triggered a major row, with even Supreme Court seeking a report from HC.While the motion is likely to be submitted to RS secretary general on Thursday, there is a concern in the opposition camp that the Upper House office may not admit the motion. As a follow-up, the INDIA bloc is likely to file a writ petition in SC against the rejection. The opposition argues that acceptance or rejection of the motion by the Rajya Sabha constitutes administrative action, which is justiciable.The opposition is accusing Justice Yadav of "" hate speech and incitement to communal harmony "", which are violative of the Constitution. Crucially, the petition is likely to charge Yadav with entering into a public debate and expressing his views in public on political matters relating to UCC, which is a violation of the 'Restatement of Values of Judicial Life, 1997' laid down by SC.Sources said the idea for removal of the judge was initiated by senior Congress functionary Digvijaya Singh , and pushed by lawyers Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha. All opposition parties are endorsing the petition, with 38 signatures collected on Wednesday and the remaining 12 to be done by Thursday, they said. ""Senior leaders will put their signatures to the petition,"" a source said.The political class is worried about the growing trend of judges making political comments and associating themselves with BJP family's events, with members arguing that the drift needs to be arrested, else ""all hell will break loose"". That Justice Yadav's remarks constitute a ""blatant communal prejudice"" has only made the issue more urgent for the opposition. In seeking Yadav's sacking, the opposition is likely to argue that no litigant can expect justice in a court where a judge holds a biased, prejudiced and publicly expressed opinion against the minority community.As per procedure, the petition will urge the Rajya Sabha Chairman to accept the motion and forward it to the President, constitute an inquiry committee to investigate the charges of hate speech, communal disharmony and violation of judicial ethics, and later initiate proceedings to remove Justice Yadav from office, if the charges are proved.","The opposition is set to file a motion in the Rajya Sabha for removal of Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav.

NEW DELHI: India’s nuclear power generation capacity has nearly doubled in the past decade from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,081 MW in 2024, Union minister for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh informed the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.The minister also informed the House that the atomic energy capacity is projected to triple to 22,480 MW by 2031-32, showcasing India’s commitment to scaling up its nuclear energy infrastructure. He said that nine atomic power projects are currently under construction, with several others in the pre-project stage, demonstrating India’s dedication to expanding nuclear energy capacity.Singh emphasised the revision of India’s power distribution framework, which has increased the home state’s share of electricity from atomic plants to 50%, with 35% allocated to neighbouring states and 15% to the national grid. This new formula ensures equitable resource distribution and reflects the federal spirit of the nation.The minister attributed the progress in nuclear power generation to several transformative initiatives, including the bulk approval of 10 nuclear reactors, increased funding allocations, collaborations with public sector undertakings, and limited private sector participation. He credited advancements in technology and streamlined administrative processes for strengthening India’s nuclear infrastructure.Singh also highlighted diverse applications of atomic energy in various fields like agriculture, healthcare and defence sector. He noted its extensive use in agriculture, including the development of 70 mutagenic crop varieties. In the health sector, India has introduced advanced isotopes for cancer treatment, while in the defence sector, atomic energy processes have been used to develop cost-effective, lightweight bulletproof jackets.The minister also underscored India’s abundant thorium reserves, which constitute 21% of the global total. Indigenous projects like ""Bhavani"" are being developed to harness this resource, reducing dependence on imported uranium and other materials.","India’s nuclear power generation capacity has nearly doubled in the past decade from 4,780 MW in 2014 to 8,081 MW in 2024.

Govt working on new law to govern space sector: Singh

New Delhi: India will be in a position to commission its deep-sea mission by the end of next year, science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said on Wednesday.He also said by the end of next year, or maybe in 2026, “we will have the first Indian in space”. Simultaneously, a crew will be sent to the seabed, 6,000 meters deep, which is possibly the maximum depth of the sea, Singh told a press conference.While addressing the ‘States’ Policy Conclave 2024’, he said, “Exploring unexplored or under-explored sectors is vital for achieving the India 2047 goal” and underscored the need to explore sectors like the deep sea and the Himalayas.Singh said marine resources are one such area which is yet to be fully explored. The deep sea has a huge concentration of natural resources, which needs to be explored in such a way that it could contribute to the growth trajectory of the nation, he said.The Deep Ocean Mission or Samudrayaan is an ambitious initiative of the ministry of earth sciences, which aims at developing technologies and capabilities for deep sea exploration . With Samudrayaan, India is embarking on a crewed expedition to reach a depth of 6,000 metres.The historic journey will be accomplished by Matsya6000 , a deep-ocean submersible designed to accommodate a crew of three members. The decision to target a depth of 6,000 meters holds strategic importance due to the presence of valuable resources like polymetallic nodules and sulphides.On the space front, Singh, who also handles the department of space, said the govt is working on a new law to govern the space sector, which has witnessed reforms over the past four years, with private players making a mark in building and launching satellites. He said India's maiden human spaceflight programme Gaganyaan was also progressing well and the first uncrewed mission was expected to be launched early next year.India is set to achieve major milestones in space exploration with plans to establish its own space station, Bharat Antariksha Station, by 2035, and to land an Indian astronaut on the Moon by 2040, Singh said.He also emphasised the significant progress made in satellite launches under the Modi government. Singh noted that India has launched 432 foreign satellites from Sriharikota, with 397 of them, nearly 90%, launched in the last decade alone.",Govt working on new law to govern space sector: Singh.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash’s brother Bikas Kumar accused Subhash’s wife, her mother, brother, and uncle of filing false complaints and demanding Rs 3 crore for a settlement. Kumar claimed that the relentless harassment drove Subhash to end his life.A 34-year-old deputy general manager of a private firm, Atul Subhash, died by suicide in his flat at Manjunatha Layout’s Delfinium Residency on Monday.Subhash, originally from Uttar Pradesh, left behind a 24-page suicide note accusing his wife, her family members, and even a judge, of pushing him to the brink. He alleged explicit instigation for suicide, harassment, extortion, and corruption.The victim's father, too alleged that Subhash's wife framed Subhash in multiple cases. He said, ""He (victim) had said to us that those in the mediation court do not work as per law, not even as per the rules of Supreme Court. He had to go to Jaunpur from Bengaluru at least 40 times. She (the deceased's wife) used to frame one charge after another. He must have been frustrated but never let us feel that. Suddenly, we received the information about the incident - he sent a mail to our younger son around 1 am. It's 100% true (the allegations of the deceased against his wife and her family). We cannot express the level of tension that our son would have been in.""The Hoysala Police Control Room received a call early Monday morning about the incident. Upon reaching the flat, the police found it locked from the inside. Breaking the lock, they discovered Subhash hanging from a ceiling fan with a nylon rope.Subhash’s suicide note details his ordeal, highlighting nine cases filed against him by his wife. These included accusations of murder, sexual misconduct, harassment for money,domestic violence , and dowry demands. Subhash alleged that these cases were part of a larger conspiracy to extort money from him.Shockingly, the note also implicated a principal family court judge in Uttar Pradesh’s Jaunpur and a court officer, accusing them of corruption and bribery.Throughout the suicide note, Subhash repeatedly wrote “Justice is Due.” He recorded a video narrating his alleged harassment and urged his family not to immerse his ashes until justice is served.The note included a heartfelt message for his estranged four-year-old son, whom he claimed was kept away from him. Subhash called for his parents to be granted custody of the child.The police have registered a case under the BNS Act and initiated an investigation.","Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, 34, died by suicide in his flat on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar Wednesday remained defiant in the face of continued opposition onslaught for his removal from Rajya Sabha chairman's post while an equally unfazed BJP and its allies rallied behind him, defending the presiding officer while seeking an apology from Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge for ""insulting"" a ""son of the soil"", who has been a ""protector of the House's dignity"".Signalling his combative intent at a public function in Jaipur, Dhankhar spoke about ""internal and external forces"", which are unable to ""digest"" India's progress and are trying to ""divide the nation and insult"" the country's institutions in a designed manner. ""Common man has a big role to play in this. We must neutralise in togetherness every anti-national narrative,"" he said.The nonchalance coincided with strong indication that the notice for his removal may be rejected shortly for not meeting the requirement of 14 days' notice. The notice was submitted on Tuesday and the Winter Session gets over on Dec 20, the timeline rendering the fate of the move almost a foregone conclusion.Dhankhar chaired proceedings of the upper House Wednesday and was completely unfazed when Congress MP Jairam Ramesh pointed out that they had submitted a notice against him. ""I am aware of it,"" Dhankhar said as he signalled start of proceedings.As the routine of treasury and opposition benches slugging it out against alleged Sonia Gandhi-George Soros and Narendra Modi-Adani links resumed, opposition MPs said they had given the notice against Dhankhar to ""protect democracy"". To this, the chairman retorted, ""I don't know who you are trying to save.""Allowed by Dhankhar to speak, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju accused Congress of aligning with anti-India forces, specifically mentioning an alleged nexus between Soros and Sonia. He highlighted Dhankhar's dedication to farmers and the poor, his role in protecting the Constitution and vowed to defend the Chair's honour. He criticised Congress for levelling ""baseless"" allegations against Dhankhar, emphasising the latter's commitment to democracy and respect for the Chair.Dhankhar did not let the opposition's charge about him being biased in favour of the govt come in the way of appreciating Modi govt once again.Addressing the India Maritime Heritage Conclave 2024 organised by the shipping ministry in Delhi barely an hour after RS was adjourned, Dhankhar praised the development during the last decade under Modi govt. ""In the last decade, we have seen many firsts in this country. This is one the firsts of its kind of steps that the govt under PM Modi has taken,"" he said.BJP displayed its support to him outside the House by playing up Dhankhar's background as a Jat farmer. Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, ""Mallikarjun Kharge ji should apologise to Dhankhar ji on behalf of Congress for insulting him. Congress and opposition parties are constantly wasting the time of Parliament and insulting democracy by creating a ruckus instead of discussing.""Pradhan said bringing a no-confidence motion against the Chairman had never happened before in Indian history, but this act of ""hurting the dignity of the temple of democracy"" had been done under leadership of Congress.BJP spokesperson and LS MP Sambit Patra condemned the opposition's move and described Dhankhar as a humble farmer's son, and claimed the notice was strategically timed after BJP highlighted alleged links between the Nehru-Gandhi family and Soros.""Jats are patriots. Jats have shed their blood for the freedom of Hindustan and for Hindustan. Today, you are making such allegations against a Jat vice-president. Somewhere you are trying to defame him by saying that he is not doing his work properly,"" Patra said.","Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar remained defiant in the face of continued opposition onslaught for his removal.

NEW DELHI: NCP Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Ajit Pawar has been allotted the second biggest category of government accommodation, a Type-VII bungalow, at 11 Janpath, which is virtually opposite the official residence of Sharad Pawar . Pawar Senior stays lives at the Type-VIII bungalow at 6 Janpath and his daughter Supriya Sule, a four-time Lok Sabha MP, stays with him.The allotment of the much-coveted Type-VII bungalow in Lutyens' Delhi to Sunetra gains importance considering that she is a first time MP and, going by rules, not entitled to an accommodation of the second-biggest category. The allotment is naturally being seen in political circles as a sign of her husband Ajit's rise as Maratha leader post the recent Maharashtra assembly elections and the corresponding diminution of Pawar Senior as Maratha chieftain. Ajit's NCP, which fought as an ally in the BJP-led Mahayuti, bagged 49 seats and has consolidated its position in the Marathwada region and his home turf as well.Ajit was first one to openly back Devendra Fadnavis name for CM's post as well.Sunetra was elected unopposed to RS on June 18 barely days after NCP drew a blank in the LS polls. She had also lost to her sister-in-law Sule in Baramati LS seat. Later, Ajit said it was a mistake to field his wife against Sule.TOI has learnt that while the 11 Janpath bungalow is under RS Pool, meaning the allotment is done by the House Committee of Upper Chamber, the bungalow at 6 Janpath is under the General Pool, which is managed by housing and urban affairs ministry.","NCP Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Ajit Pawar has been allotted the second biggest category of government accommodation, a Type-VII bungalow.

NEW DELHI: India, France and UAE on Wednesday kicked off a major air combat exercise called “Desert Knight” over the Arabian Sea, strengthening trilateral defence cooperation and enhancing military interoperability amid the ongoing geopolitical churn.The IAF deployed several fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs and Jaguars, backed by IL-78 mid-air refuellers and AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft, from air-bases like Jamnagar on the west coast for the exercise, while Rafale and F-16 jets and other aircraft from France and UAE operated from the Al Dhafra air-base, sources told TOI.The “large force engagement” with intensive combat manoeuvers was conducted around 350 to 400-km southwest of Karachi over the Arabian Sea. “The Desert Knight exercise will continue for three days. It is the second such trilateral endeavour this year to build synergy among the three air forces as well as improve combat skills, with multiple aircraft types operating in a realistic scenario,” a source said.The exercise is yet another indicator of the way India is steadily building military interoperability with countries in the region, especially the Persian Gulf, in conjunction with others like the US, France and Australia.All such exercises on a bilateral, trilateral or multilateral basis build strategic cooperation with like-minded countries in the crucial Indo-Pacific, a region where China’s continued muscle-flexing and expansionist tactics have raised concerns among many nations.The navies of India, France and UAE, incidentally, had also conducted their first ever trilateral maritime partnership exercise to hone their combat skills against traditional as well as non-traditional threats through a wide spectrum of operations on the high seas in June last year.Under the trilateral framework launched by their foreign ministers in 2022, India, France and the UAE are working on several areas, including defence, technology, energy and environment, in tune with an ambitious roadmap chalked out by the three countries.India and France, of course, have had a long-standing strategic partnership, which ranges from maritime security and defence-industrial collaboration to counterterrorism and information-sharing in the military domain. The two also regularly conduct the `Shakti’ exercise between their armies, `Varuna’ between their navies and `Garuda’ between their air forces.The defence partnership with the UAE, in turn, has witnessed a sharp upward trajectory in recent years, with regular professional exchanges, warship visits, staff talks, training programmes and combat exercises, as part of India’s wider outreach to the Persian Gulf region. The IAF, for instance, now often deploys fighters and other aircraft for the annual multi-nation `Desert Flag’ exercise at the Al Dhafra air-base.","The IAF deployed several fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs and Jaguars, backed by IL-78 mid-air refuellers and AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft.

I am sure that all state governments and the policymakers have taken note of this unfortunate incident, and more reforms will follow in all of these aspects.""He added, ""I think the time has also come for us to review many of these family-related legislations and also introduce, wherever possible, an aspect of gender neutrality so as to protect both partners in a marriage.

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday lashed out at Congress neta Rahul Gandhi for making ""baseless statements"" about the state of public sector banks (PSBs), saying the country's banking sector, particularly state-run banks, has seen a ""remarkable turnaround"" under PM Narendra Modi.She was responding to comments by LoP in Lok Sabha on X about state of PSBs, which he alleged had been turned into ""private financiers"" only for the rich and powerful corporations and were being forced to prioritise profit over people and unable to serve the people effectively.Rahul also said that with staff shortages and ""toxic work environment"", PSBs are expected to reach unachievable targets without being provided a level playing field.Sitharaman, in a series of posts on X, said, ""Didn't the people who met with the LoP tell him that high concentration of corporate credit and indiscriminate lending during UPA tenure had resulted in significant deterioration in health of PSBs?""

"Rajnath meets Putin, affirms India will stand by Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-meets-putin-affirms-india-will-stand-by-russia/articleshow/116186941.cms,"India and Russia reaffirmed their strategic partnership, with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasizing their strong bond during a meeting with President Putin. Discussions focused on expediting S-400 deliveries, enhancing Sukhoi-30MKI maintenance, and expanding joint production of AK-203 rifles. While Russia remains India's primary arms supplier, India is diversifying its procurement.

NEW DELHI: India’s expansive strategic partnership with Russia was reinforced on Tuesday, with defence minister Rajnath Singh telling President Vladimir Putin that their “friendship is higher than the highest mountain and deeper than the deepest ocean”, while the two countries also inked a wide-ranging protocol on defence cooperation in “ongoing and prospective areas”.In his almost hour long meeting with Putin at the Kremlin, Singh also stressed that India “has always stood by its Russian friends and will continue to do so in the future”, underlining the fine balance India has struck between Russia and the US-led western countries even during the ongoing Ukraine war.“Putin and Singh were of the view that the bilateral partnership holds immense potential and their combined efforts will pave the way for remarkable outcomes,” an Indian official said.There were, of course, several concerns raised by the Indian delegation during the 21st India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Military-Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting, which was co-chaired by Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrey Belousov.Sources said New Delhi asked Moscow to speed up deliveries of the two remaining squadrons of the S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems as well as set up a repair and overhaul facility for them in India, while also ensuring timely deliveries, maintenance support and supply of spares for several other weapon systems and platforms, ranging from Sukhoi-30MKI fighters to T-90S main-battle tanks.Moscow was also asked to give more transfer of technology (ToT) to improve the “maintenance and sustenance” of the IAF’s existing fleet of 259 Sukhoi jets, the bulk of them produced by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) under licence from Russia for over $12 billion.With Singh asking Russian defence industries to “explore new opportunities” to enhance their participation in `Make in India’ projects, Belousov said the operationalisation of the military technical cooperation agreement for 2021-31 will give the necessary impetus to such endeavours.Dubbing the ongoing joint production of AK-203Kalashnikov assault rifles at the Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of UP a “resounding success”, Singh also told Belousov that Russia must expand the production of such products in India and explore exporting them to other countries, the sources said.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to a major delay in the delivery of the S-400 missile systems to India, which were contracted under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract in 2018.IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan, but is likely to get the other two units only by 2026 at the earliest.On the Sukhoi front, the procurement of another 12 of the jets is now in the pipeline to replace the ones that have crashed over the years. In Sept, the defence ministry had also inked a mega over Rs 26,000 crore contract for the procurement of 240 AL-31FP aero-engines to power the Sukhois, which will be manufactured by the Koraput Division of HAL with help from Russia.There is also a major indigenous Rs 63,000 crore upgrade plan to make the existing Sukhois much more lethal with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years, as reported by TOI earlier.Russia still remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for over 36% of its arms imports, though New Delhi has been focussing on enhancing its own domestic defence production. India has also increasingly turned to countries like the US, France and Israel for military hardware and software over the last two decades.Around 60% of the existing inventory of the Indian armed forces, however, is still of Russian-origin, including fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs and MiG-29s, warships like aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, Talwar and Teg-class frigates and Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines, AN-32 medium-lift aircraft and Mi-17 helicopters, among others.","India and Russia reaffirmed their strategic partnership during a meeting with President Putin.

On India



Gaza Ceasefire



Two-State Solution



On Syria



NEW DELHI: Israel can learn from India the use of soft power to win the war of narratives in times of conflict, Israeli ambassador to India Reuven Azar said during an interaction with TOI editors. As Israel has pressed on with its military offensive to destroy Hamas, there's been a wave of support for Palestinians in Gaza. Azar said Israel, as the only Jewish state in the region, was outnumbered in geopolitical composition.""We are the one and only Jewish state. You have very powerful media outlets that are investing billions of dollars like Al Jazeera, TRT, and many other outlets. Frankly, we haven't been investing enough because most of our investment went to hard power, not to soft power. You have been combining hard and soft power in the way that you have been challenging these groups,"" he said.As India looks to keep its relations with both Israel and Palestine on an even keel, calling repeatedly for a ceasefire in Gaza but also strongly backing Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, Azar said the Indian govt has been supportive of Israel's ""core national interests"". Acknowledging the differences between the two sides on issues like India's continued aid to UNRWA, an agency banned by Israel, and India's voting on UNGA resolutions concerning Palestine, the ambassador said Israel shares friendly ties with India and it will continue to engage with the Indian govt on these issues.""I'm not in the business of giving grades to our friends. I think that when it comes to our core national interests, India has been pretty cooperative. Of course, we would like to see many countries, including India, changing their voting pattern. And I told our Indian friends that when it comes to UNRWA, we prefer that they divert their assistance to the needy people through other channels. So, this is a conversation we're having and we are going to continue to engage. At the end of the day, this is a very friendly relationship and we have to continue having the discussion,"" Azar said.Like last year, India released $5 million for UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in Near East). The govt also informed Parliament last week that it voted in favour of 10 out of the 13 resolutions that were introduced in the UNGA since the conflict began, and abstained on 3.Azar suggested there might be some progress in negotiations for a hostage deal. The ambassador said Israel's agenda in Gaza is to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas and ensure that the group is not able to rearm itself.""For that, you need a new order in the Gaza Strip. So, that's what we are trying to achieve. To engage, to continue decimating Hamas, to engage with partners that want to work with us to restore peace. And that may take time. We want to see the release of hostages in batches at least. The PM (Benjamin Netanyahu) just met the families of the hostages and said he feels that time is ripe for a hostage deal. It seems there might be some progress in negotiations.... The bottom line is that we won't allow Hamas the possibility that in return of hostages, they will be able to take back control of the Gaza Strip.""While India and most other countries have repeatedly called for a two-state solution, Israeli Parliament Knesset voted overwhelmingly earlier this year in favour of a resolution rejecting Palestinian statehood. The ambassador said Israel wants the Palestinians to rule themselves to the extent that they can without threatening Israel.""It means that as long as you have a population that is bound to try and destroy you, you won't be able to give them full sovereignty because they will use that in order to destroy you. We tried it with the Gaza Strip. Look what happened. For 17 years, we gave a chance. And then Hamas indoctrinated their people from the age of two or three just to kill Jews. They completely took hostage all their activities just to create this capability to destroy the state of Israel. So, we have to be realistic about the degree of self-rule that Palestinians can have, unless a new generation comes that thinks differently.""Speaking about the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and its potential to further destabilise West Asia, Azar said there are three things about the geopolitical situation that are important now. ""First is that the Iranian axis is debilitated as a result of the cutting of its three tentacles (Hezbollah, Hamas and Assad). The second is what's going to happen with Russian presence in eastern Mediterranean because this is shifting balance of power between Nato and Russia. And third, this was a meticulously planned attack by the Syrian opposition that was supported, sponsored by the Turkish govt. The question is to what extent they are going to be able to stabilise the Syria situation. Don't forget that the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham comes from Jabhat al-Nusra, which was part of al-Qaida,"" Azar said.","Reuven Azar: Israel can learn from India the use of soft power to win the war of narratives in times of conflict. Indian govt has been supportive of Israel's ""core national interests"", he said. Azar suggested there might be some progress in negotiations for a hostage deal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116186102,imgsize-352707,width-400,resizemode-4/116186102.jpg"

The Oklahoma City Thunder emerged victorious, lauded for their astute drafting and talent acquisition under Sam Presti.

NBA executives are responsible for important roles such as managing and guiding the operations. While their responsibilities differ according to their specific designation, their main task is to oversee basketball operations, business activities, and long-term goals. The New York Times canvassed 40 executives across the league, including presidents, vice presidents, general managers, and assistant general managers to rank the NBA’s top front offices. The NBA has 30 front offices, one for each of the league’s teams.Of course, the execs can’t vote for their own team. Each exec ranked their top five. Points were allocated similar to NBA MVP voting – 10 points for the first rank, 7 points for the second, five points for the third place, three points for the fourth, and only one point for the fifth. After the voting was completed, one team won by a landslide.Points: 354Governor: Clayton BennettGeneral manager: Sam PrestiHead coach: Mark DaigneaultThe team got 29 first places and nine-second places during the voting. It also appeared on 39 ballots. With talents like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a high-scoring offensive player, and Alex Caruso, a veteran defensive stopper, OKC is one of the most popular teams. Originally established as Seattle SuperSonics, the front office already has a strong foundation that maintained a healthy environment even after transitioning to Oklahoma.Sam Presti took over the front office in 2007, during the SuperSonics days. And it’s safe to say Presti has proven himself throughout the years. OKC’s draft strategy is one of the best in the NBA. They have a history of acquiring draft picks from other teams, even if it means taking on bad contracts. They have 11 different organizations' draft picks, accounting for 37% of the NBA's total.Points: 250Governor: Wyc GrousbeckPresident of basketball operations: Brad StevensHead coach: Joe MazzullaBoston Celtics won second place after falling 104 points short of OKC. It got nine first places, 19 second places, and appeared on 35 ballots. Founded in 1946, Celtics is one of the oldest teams in the NBA. While Brad Stevens has only been in charge for three seasons, the front office’s infrastructure has been there for a long time.Points: 114Governor: Micky ArisonPresident: Pat RileyHead coach: Erik SpoelstraWhile Miami Heat didn’t rank first a single time, it was voted second place seven times and also got third place ten times. Additionally, the team appeared on 24 ballots. The front office is known for its longevity and consistency with a number of long-tenured executives including Pat Riley, who has been the President since 1995.Andy Elisburg, Riley's deputy, has been with the Heat even longer than Riley and is regarded as one of the league's most respected executives. The assistant general manager joined the front office in 1995 and the Vice President of player personnel, Eric Amsler has been there for 21 seasons. All those years of working together have given them remarkable results.Points: 64Governor: Robert PeraPresident of basketball operations: Zach KleimanHead coach: Taylor JenkinsThe Memphis Grizzlies received one first-place vote and one second-place vote, on top of appearing on 15 ballots. Zach Kleiman won the league's Executive of the Year award in 2022, after the Grizzlies won 56 games, indicating a quick recovery from the Grit 'N' Grind period. They are mainly popular for their smart acquisitions as they make late drafts and value signings.While the team marketing is small, they signed their star players Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr through late drafting. The roster is full of underappreciated and overlooked talents. Despite the many rotation injuries, the Grizzlies are 7-4 and sit sixth in a competitive Western Conference.Points: 54Governor: Glen TaylorPresident of basketball operations: Tim ConnellyHead coach: Chris FinchThe Minnesota Timberwolves got one first-place vote, two second-place votes, and appeared on 15 ballots. Their front office is known for making smart moves. Ever since joining the team in 2022, Tim Connelly has made big, risk-taking moves. He traded for Rudy Gobert and built an environment for Anthony Edwards to grow. His boldness has earned the respect and admiration of his peers.It's also worth mentioning that the Timberwolves had a fantastic season, winning the most regular season games in 20 years and advancing to the Western Conference finals.Points: 41Governor: James DolanPresident: Leon RoseHead coach: Tom ThibodeauThe New York Knicks got three third-place votes, seven fourth-place votes, and appeared on 15 ballots. While the front office consists of some of the best talents in all of sports, a lot of them don’t get the recognition they deserve. Brock Aller, the vice president of basketball and strategic planning, is the unsung architect of Manhattan basketball's current state.The 39-year-old Aller was included in The Athletic's 40 under 40 list of young managers, coaches, executives, and influencers. The Knicks have seen a massive turnaround under the leadership of Leon Rose ever since he took over in March 2020. Almost all of the front office's decisions prior to this season have been successful. They also formed the best Knicks team in a generation by combining connections, savvy, and intelligence.Points: 33Governor: Dan DeVosPresident of basketball operations: Jeff WeltmanHead coach: Jamahl MosleyThe Orlando Magic received one second-place vote and three third-place votes, on top of appearing on 9 ballots. The Magic's commercial practices have changed under the CEO, Alex Martins' leadership. The 2022-2023 season was the team's most successful business year thanks to the efforts of the front office.Another key exec in Magic is Jeff Weltman, who was appointed president of basketball operations in 2017. Since his joining, the Magic made it to the postseason in consecutive seasons in 2018-19 and 2019-20 for the first time in eight years. During his second season in Orlando, the Magic won the Southeast Division title for the first time since 2009–10 and secured a spot in the NBA Playoffs for the first time since 2012.Points: 30Governor: Dan GilbertPresident of basketball operations: Koby AltmanHead coach: Kenny AtkinsonThe Cleveland Cavaliers got three third-place votes, and four fourth-place votes, and appeared on ten ballots. Since LeBron James' departure in 2018, the Cavaliers have gradually climbed the Eastern Conference ladder. Their 21-4 record through 25 games suggests that they may just reach the top this season. This is their best start in team history.After acquiring Donovan Mitchell in September 2022, the front office had a major goal: get him to sign an extension. This summer, Mitchell agreed to a contract to keep him in Cleveland until the 2026-27 season, with a player option for the following year.Points: 21Governor: Joe LacobGeneral manager: Mike Dunleavy Jr.Head coach: Steve KerrThe Golden State Warriors received one second-place vote, two third-place votes, and appeared on five ballots. While the front office isn’t what it used to be half a decade ago, they have still managed to rejuvenate the Stephen Curry led roster by adding new and young talents. Led by general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., the front office has added seasoned veterans and young players like Brandin Podziemski and Trayce Jackson-Davis.The team has yet to reach the heights it did half a decade ago, but they are off to a good start this season. Dunleavy, executive VP of basketball operations Kirk Lacob, assistant general manager/director of player personnel Larry Harris, and a slew of young front-office staffers have rebuilt the roster around Curry and Draymond Green.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 Points: 14Governor: Peter J. HoltGeneral manager: Brian WrightHead coach/president: Gregg PopovichWith two third-place votes, one fourth-place vote, and an appearance on four ballots, the San Antonio Spurs managed to snag its place in the list of top 10 front offices in the NBA. As a team with five NBA champion cups under its belt, it has a huge history of success. The team won the championships in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014, so it’s safe to say it has maintained its consistency over the decades.The front office has recently taken measures to improve their roster. Hence, they selected Victor Wembanyama with the first pick in the 2023 draft and announced that Manu Ginobili will rejoin the Spurs as a special advisor to basketball operations.","The New York Times surveyed 40 NBA executives to rank the league's top front offices.

NEW DELHI: “The mediation court didn’t follow the law, not even Supreme Court rules,” said Pawan Kumar , grieving the death of his 34-year-old son, Subhash Atul, a deputy general manager at an automobile firm, who died by suicide in Bengaluru on Monday.Atul’s father, Pawan Kumar, accused his son’s in-laws and the judicial system of pushing him to the edge during an ongoing legal battle over divorce and child custody.Speaking to the media, Pawan Kumar said,""He was forced to travel to Jaunpur from Bengaluru nearly 40 times. His wife kept filing one charge after another. He must have been under immense pressure, but he never let us sense it. Suddenly, we got the news of his death. It’s 100% true that his wife and her family harassed him. We cannot describe the level of tension our son must have been in.”Subhash's death has exposed allegations of his wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family demanding Rs 3 crore to withdraw legal cases and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to his son. His brother, Bikas Kumar, filed a police complaint, leading to cases of abetment to suicide being registered against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.“My brother was mentally and physically exhausted ever since the court battle began. He was mocked by his in-laws and told to die if he couldn’t pay the money or gain visitation rights. This drove him to the extreme step,” said Bikas in his statement to the police.In his suicide note, Subhash detailed the unrelenting harassment he faced, including eight allegedly false police complaints, and accused a family court judge in Uttar Pradesh of bias.

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India. The meeting was subsequently cancelled when Tesla announced staff reductions amidst declining sales.A separate source indicated that the outcome of Tesla's discussions with India's largest property developer remains uncertain, with the company maintaining parallel discussions with other entities.Also Read | ‘Investing in India is profitable’: Putin heaps praises on PM Modi; says Russia ready to set up manufacturing operations in India The Avenue Mall, which houses international retailers like Uniqlo, Mango and Marks and Spencer, is being considered for an 8,000 square feet Tesla showroom, according to the second source.The first source emphasised that Tesla's search remains in preliminary stages without final decisions.Questions remain regarding Tesla's approach to vehicle imports, whether at the 100% tax rate or under India's new policy allowing certain EVs at 15% import duty.Following Tesla's previous unrealised investment plans, the Indian government is considering policy adjustments to attract manufacturers like Hyundai Motor and Toyota, who have shown preliminary interest.While India's EV market currently represents approximately 2% of total car sales of 4 million annually, the government aims to increase this to 30% by 2030.Tesla's showroom search coincides with Musk's Starlink considering Indian market entry.","Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi.

In a recent social media exchange, Elon Musk spotlighted Singapore’s steep decline in fertility rates, a trend he described as an existential challenge. Responding to a post by Mario Nawfal—a prominent personality on X (formerly Twitter)—about the nation’s ""baby crisis"" and the potential role of robotics in addressing the issue, Musk remarked,This statement has reignited global discussions on the demographic struggles of developed nations, where falling birth rates pose long-term economic and social challenges. Musk, a vocal advocate for population growth, has frequently warned of the adverse consequences of shrinking populations, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues for global sustainability. The post highlights concerns about aging societies and their impact on labor markets, innovation, and healthcare systems, while underscoring the rising interest in technologies like robotics to compensate for declining human workforce numbers.Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades. In 2023, the TFR reached a historic low of 0.97, marking the first time it has dipped below 1.0. This figure signifies that, on average, each woman in Singapore is having fewer than one child—far below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population.The primary drivers of Singapore’s fertility decline stem from evolving societal trends. Data from the Singapore government reveals that a growing number of women aged 25–34, considered prime childbearing years, are choosing to remain single. Additionally, the marital fertility rate among women in their 20s has seen a substantial decline, accounting for approximately 32% of the overall drop in TFR.Between 1990 and 2005, marital fertility rates among women aged 25–34 experienced a sharp decrease. While there was a slight recovery in 2023, the long-term trend remains concerning.Despite its demographic challenges, Singapore’s advancements in robotics and automation could help address labor shortages caused by a declining workforce. According to the International Federation of Robotics, Singapore ranks second globally in robot density, with 770 industrial robots per 10,000 workers. This technological prowess allows the country to sustain industries despite high labor costs and a relatively small manufacturing base.Musk’s interest in robotics is well-documented through Tesla’s investment in humanoid robots designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. While he has not directly suggested robots as a replacement for human populations, his remarks hint at the potential for technology to mitigate the economic and social impacts of declining birth rates.Musk’s statement sparked widespread debate on social media, with opinions ranging from support to criticism.Some users highlighted Singapore’s strong immigration policies as a mechanism to counteract its population decline. The city-state has long relied on foreign talent and workers to supplement its labor force and sustain economic growth.Others pointed to deeper issues contributing to the reluctance to have children. Rising living costs, financial instability, and paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyles were frequently cited as barriers to family planning.Notably, many individuals expressed concerns about the affordability of raising children in an increasingly competitive and expensive environment.Singapore’s struggle with low fertility rates mirrors challenges faced by many developed nations, including Japan, South Korea, and certain European countries. Declining birth rates have far-reaching consequences, including:","Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
